10	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""Milk is a great source of nutrients for kids, but the flavored varieties have more calories, are highly processed and contain unnecessary sugars and additives, which don't add any nutritional value.

Science and common sense don't back that position up. Other dairy products are a good source of nutrition and kids can get calcium from leafy greens, soy, nuts, and beans. All that's needed is those marketing dollars behind good old white milk. We know that with the right backing from the school community, kids are happy to drink it...

10	Is Golf a Sport?	Sports experts agree that golf lacks the athletic rigor needed to be a real sport. Golf was ranked 51 out of 60 activities by a panel of sports scientists, athletes, and journalists assembled by ESPN. They ranked the athletic difficulty of 60 activities based on ten categories such as endurance, agility, and strength. The panel determined that the level of athleticism in golf ranked lower than ping pong and just ahead of roller skating. [31] Read More
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see. No actual proof, as it is understood in science, exists… When modern life evolved over 500 million years ago, CO2 was more than 10 times higher than today, yet life flourished at this time. Then an Ice Age occurred 450 million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higher than today. There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.”

Prostitution flourishes in the black market that would not exist if brothels and hookers were legitimized, licensed, medically inspected, zoned and taxed. Like drugs, gambling and other crimes of morality, or alcohol prohibition of years past, the black market is nourished by draconian laws that forever fail to accomplish its intended purpose...  In Germany, and other countries, prostitution is legal and taxed. They turn the 'crime' into an economic plus. In other countries like the United States, we create the 'crime,' which turns the behavior into an economic negative. And, it's still a thriving business, law or no law."""

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“A professional services contract or tenure is needed for teachers in the public schools of Florida to prevent despotism, nepotism, and cronyism from denying good teachers the opportunity of making teaching a career. Without it, teaching becomes a job that only rewards teachers who teach the most able students instead of a profession where teachers help all students learn… The school principal is the gatekeeper for excellence in teaching at their school. When the school principal acts responsibly, poor teachers are weeded out and let go, and good teachers are awarded tenure after three years of teaching. Tenure gives these teachers the sense that their job is secure and that it cannot be terminated by the whim of an administrator, complaining parent or other adult, or a disgruntled student. Tenure encourages teaching careers. The last thing politicians should want is to turn Florida education into a spoils system where administrative patronage determines who gets hired and fired at the end of each school year. Tenure keeps that from happening to good teachers.”

Really! Are they ready to volunteer? Even if they were, or even if some were coerced to do so (say prisoners or terminally ill patients), would we really want to move our society in that direction?… Do not think that the only value coming from studies utilizing animals is development of cures or testing of potential cures. In fact, studying living creatures gives the scientist an opportunity to learn how living systems work. The new knowledge often expands our understanding of human physiology… It is important to realize that studies in animals are not just done for, and do not just lead to, treatments in humans. Indeed, treatments for other animals also arise from such studies. Consider, for example, that paralyzed dogs have regained their ability to walk as a result of research conducted in rodents and dogs.”
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	"People should not have their tax dollars used to support something they believe is wrong. Peter S. Sprigg, MDiv, Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at the Family Research Council, said that if gay marriage were legalized, ""[t]axpayers, consumers, and businesses would be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships... One of the key arguments often heard in support of homosexual civil marriage revolves around all the government 'benefits' that homosexuals claim they are denied. Many of these 'benefits' involve one thing–taxpayer money that homosexuals are eager to get their hands on."" [146] Gay marriage would entitle gay couples to typical marriage benefits including claiming a tax exemption for a spouse, receiving social security payments from a deceased spouse, and coverage by a spouse’s health insurance policy, largely at taxpayers' expense. On Dec. 17, 2009 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost to the federal government of extending employment benefits to same-sex domestic partners of certain federal employees (making no mention of additional costs such as Social Security and inheritance taxes) would be $596 million in mandatory spending and $302 million in discretionary spending between 2010 and 2019.

Directors of homeless shelters, and people who live on the streets, tell us homeless substance abusers migrate here for easy access to pot. Five years of Big Marijuana ushered in a doubling in the number of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana, based on research by the pro-legalization Denver Post. Five years of commercial pot have been five years of more marijuana in schools than teachers and administrators ever feared… The investigation [by Education News Colorado, Solutions and the I-News Network] found an increase in high school drug violations of 71 percent since legalization. School suspensions for drugs increased 45 percent. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found Colorado ranks first in the country for marijuana use among teens, scoring well above the national average.

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia… – Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century. – The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year – from January through September, with the exception of June – were the warmest on record for those respective months… – Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans.”
10	Is Legal Prostitution a Part of Sexual Liberation?

01	Is Poor Representation by Public Defense Attorneys a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""During 1995-96, Congress eliminated all funding for the 20 capital post-conviction defender organizations known as 'resource centers.' The resource centers served three vital functions. Their trained attorneys provided direct representation to many death-sentenced prisoners. The offices also assisted pro bono firms and appointed counsel in hundreds of cases. Lastly, the centers monitored the progress of cases from conclusion of trial through clemency to ensure that claims were not forfeited by inexperienced counsel and that individuals were not executed without representation or without review of their constitutional claims.  Only a handful of states now directly support a capital post-conviction counsel office and even fewer provide funding at the same level that had been appropriated by Congress. One compelling example is Pennsylvania, which, after losing federal funds for the resource center, refused to spend any money for capital post-conviction attorneys to represent those on death row, but has consistently allocated $500,000 annually for prosecutors who are assigned the responsibility of opposing death penalty post-conviction and habeas applications.  Almost every state now makes some provision for appointment of counsel once a pro se application for habeas relief is filed by a death row prisoner. However, very few states require that appointed lawyers have sufficient experience and skill to handle this complex and time-consuming litigation, and few compensate lawyers with more than token fee payments or provide reimbursement for the substantial costs that must be incurred to investigate, prepare and litigate state post-conviction claims.  The number of jurisdictions with death-sentenced prisoners who lack adequate legal representation is growing at an alarming rate. There are currently 3300 persons on death row in the United States and 99.5% of them are indigent.”"

The way to address oppression is to end it - not legalize, regulate or make it more tolerable.

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“I am a Christian, and I am in favor of gay marriage. The reason I am for gay marriage is because of my faith. What I see in the Bible’s accounts of Jesus and his followers is an insistence that we don’t have the moral authority to deny others the blessing of holy institutions like baptism, communion, and marriage. God, through the Holy Spirit, infuses those moments with life, and it is not ours to either give or deny to others… It is not our place, it seems, to sort out who should be denied a bond with God and the Holy Spirit of the kind that we find through baptism, communion, and marriage. The water will flow where it will. Intriguingly, this rule will apply whether we see homosexuality as a sin or not. The water is for all of us. We see the same thing at the Last Supper, as Jesus gives the bread and wine to all who are there—even to Peter, who Jesus said would deny him, and to Judas, who would betray him. The question before us now is not whether homosexuality is a sin, but whether being gay should be a bar to baptism or communion or marriage. The answer is in the Bible. Peter and Jesus offer a strikingly inclusive form of love and engagement. They hold out the symbols of Gods’ love to all. How arrogant that we think it is ours to parse out stingily!”

10	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“After taking office in 1981, Reagan began a sustained attack on the government’s civil rights apparatus, opened an assault on affirmative action and social welfare programs, embraced the white racist leaders of then-apartheid South Africa and waged war on a tiny, black Caribbean nation… In 1984, he successfully campaigned for reelection on a ‘Morning in America’ theme. But his presidency was a long and dreary night for African Americans. Consider this record. Reagan:… * Supported racism with remarks like those that characterized poor, black women as ‘welfare queens.’ * Fired U.S. Commission on Civil Rights members who were critical of his civil rights policies, including his strong opposition to affirmative action programs… * Sought to limit and gut the Voting Rights Act. * Slashed important programs like the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) that provided needed assistance to black people… The gushy tributes to Reagan might be understandable eulogies, but they also are a testament to the persistence of two Americas, one black and one white.

'Letting die', on the contrary, means to give way to an ongoing inner-organismic process of disintegration, without supporting or substituting vital functions. Therefore the extubation [removal from a ventilator] of an incurably ill patient, though a physical action with subsequent death, is not killing in its proper meaning.

We import 70% of our oil at a cost of $700 billion a year - four times the annual cost of the Iraq war.   I've been an oil man all my life, but this is one emergency we can't drill our way out of. But if we create a new renewable energy network, we can break our addiction to foreign oil."""
01	Is There a Connection between Sexual Orientation and Handedness?	neuropsychological testing, we found an increased incidence of left-hand preference (defined as non-consistent right-hand preference) in a group of 32 homosexual women. A trend in the same direction was found in a group of 38 homosexual men. These results suggest that homosexual orientation has a neurobiological component possibly related to hemispheric functional asymmetry.”
01	Does Obamacare Allow Individuals to Appeal Medical Service Denials? – YES	"""The Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law passed in 2010, requires many health plans to meet basic standards regarding internal appeals and external review processes...  - Right to information about why a claim or coverage has been denied. Health plans and insurance companies have to tell you why they've decided to deny a claim or chosen to end your coverage. They have to let you know how you can dispute decisions.   - Right to appeal to the insurance company.  If you've had a claim denied or had your health insurance coverage cancelled or rescinded back to the date you initially enrolled, you have the right to an internal appeals process. You may ask your insurance company to conduct a full and fair review of its decision. If the case is urgent, your insurance company must speed up this process.   - Right to an independent review. In many cases, you may be able to resolve your problem during the internal appeals process with your insurer. But you have other options if you can't work it out through the internal appeals process. You now have the right to take your appeal to an independent third-party for review of the insurer's decision. This is called 'external review.' External review means that the insurance company no longer gets the final say over many benefit decisions. It also means patients and doctors have more control over health care."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Violent video game players know the difference between virtual violence in the context of a game and appropriate behavior in the real world. By age seven, children can distinguish fantasy from reality, and can tell the difference between video game violence and real-world violence. [99][100] Video game players understand they are playing a game. Kids see fantasy violence all the time, from Harry Potter and the Minions to Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry. Their ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality prevents them from emulating video game violence in real life. [9] Exposure to fantasy is important for kids.

10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""On the basis of substantive ethics, clinical practice, policy, and other concerns articulated in this position paper, the ACP does not support legalization of physician-assisted suicide. It is problematic given the nature of the patient–physician relationship, affects trust in the relationship and in the profession, and fundamentally alters the medical profession's role in society. Furthermore, the principles at stake in this debate also underlie medicine's responsibilities regarding other issues and the physician's duties to provide care based on clinical judgment, evidence, and ethics. Society's focus at the end of life should be on efforts to address suffering and the needs of patients and families, including improving access to effective hospice and palliative care."""

When we are witnesses to actual crimes, such as domestic abuse or robbery, we want to be able to report it without fearing deportation. Undocumented immigrants are very often victims of crime and extreme exploitation too — especially when perpetrators know they can't ask for help.   Without the assurance of sanctuary city policies, undocumented people will be less likely to report crime, which makes our cities less safe for everyone… When cities, counties and even states put sanctuary statutes in place, they're taking the pressure off local law enforcement to aid in the inhumane practice of rounding up people. As a result, communities have officers with smaller burdens and community members who are more engaged. Sanctuary cities mean stronger communities."""

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“We’ll do more to support teachers and reward great teaching – and that includes ending tenure as we know it so that tenure is awarded for performance, not taken for granted. Teachers and principals are professionals. They deserve to be paid like professionals, treated like professionals, and evaluated like professionals. But for too long, the tenure evaluation process for both principals and teachers has been a formality – a rubber stamp. It used to be that 99.1 percent of teachers received tenure. That’s right, 99.1 percent. But last year, we started using data to make tenure decisions, and the tenure number dropped to 89 percent. For the other 11 percent, they were just not ready to receive a lifetime job protection… It’s time for us to end the ‘last-in, first out’ layoff policy that puts children at risk here in New York – and across our wonderful country. With more budget cuts looming, principals across the country will have no choice but to make layoffs based only on seniority – so their newest teachers would be the first ones to go, even if they happen to be the best teachers. That makes no sense. Remember our one and only question: is it good for children?”
01	Is Poor Representation by Public Defense Attorneys a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""Eighteen death-penalty states lack statewide public-defender organizations, and many of those that have them underfund them so seriously that lawyers end up handling huge caseloads that would be considered unconscionable, to say nothing of impractical, in the private sector. Most public defenders are so poorly paid that many talented lawyers tend to shy away from this sort of practice. Some jurisdictions award capital cases to the attorney making the lowest bid. In one Georgia county the low-bid public-contract attorney tried fourteen cases, entered a grand total of seven motions, and entered 262 guilty pleas for his court-assigned clients from 1993 to 1998. Other states randomly assign lawyers from a general list, a system that almost ensures that lawyers lacking appropriate qualifications will frequently be found. Aden Harrison Jr., a black man indicted for murder in Georgia, was assigned an eighty-three-year-old attorney who had been an imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.""  [Editors Note: In 1987 Harrison appealed his death sentence to the Supreme Court of Georgia (Harrison v. State). The Supreme Court of Georgia upheld Harrison’s conviction and his death sentence. Further research by ProCon.org has revealed that Harrison, at some point, had his sentence converted to life. He is still serving his life sentence at Valdosta State Prison in Georgia as of Aug. 29, 2008.]"
10	Should Physicians Participate in Executions?	"""No matter how one feels about capital punishment, it is disquieting for physicians to act as agents of the state in the assisting, supervising or contributing to a legally authorized execution. Physicians are fundamentally healers dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so. The knowledge and skill of physicians must only be used for care, compassion and healing. To have the state mandate that physician skills be turned against a human being undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine – first, do no harm.   The American Medical Association is troubled by continuous refusal of states to acknowledge the ethical obligations of physicians that strictly prohibit involvement in capital punishment. The AMA's policy is clear and unambiguous – requiring physicians to participate in executions violates their oath to protect lives and introduces deep ambiguity into the very definition of medical care.   Oklahoma and other states that continue to authorize lethal injections must honor the well-established principle of medical ethics that prohibits physician participation in capital punishment."""

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“When there was discussion about bringing churches under the new Social Security system in the days of President Franklin Roosevelt, he quickly replied, ‘But that would be taxing God!’ And so it would… Churches should not pay taxes because the government does not have the authority to demand it! Does not the Constitution clearly prohibit the government from making any law restricting religion? Does not the ability to tax actually mean the ability to control – or destroy? I thought most of us believed in the separation of church and state (but not separation of God and state), but if so, how can any government entity presume to tax the church? After all, a ‘higher’ always taxes a ‘lower,’ and will any Bible believer maintain that government is over the Church of the Living God? I thought Christ was preeminent over all.”
01	Does a Person's Race Affect the Likelihood of Him/Her Receiving the Death Penalty?	"""There is today a substantial basis for concern about race discrimination in the administration of the death penalty. For example, research in Georgia in the 1970’s, and in Kentucky, New Jersey and Philadelphia in the 1980’s and the 1990’s, clearly documents the risk of race of defendant and race of victim discrimination. Specifically, our Georgia and Philadelphia research suggests that such discrimination can produce a 25 to 30% excess death sentencing rate compared to what we would see in an evenhanded system."""

01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“First, we need standardized tests to provide basic information about how our schools are performing relative to each other. In the current environment of testing- and accountability-mania, it’s easy to forget that this is actually very useful information for improvement purposes. The fact that we have used this information for other purposes, centering on punitive accountability measures, has taken our eyes off of this benefit to standardized testing. There are dozens of non-punitive ways to use this information, such as resource allocation, professional development planning, and identifying school goals for improvement. Second, we need standardized testing to identify inequities and achievement gaps. When we have no solid way to measure learning outcomes, it’s easy for inequities to hide behind our good intentions and best efforts.” [Editor’s Note: In a June 7, 2012 email to ProCon.org, Justin Baeder confirmed that he remains “Pro” to our core question.]

While it is completely understandable and appropriate that people wish to be compassionate to those who suffer with PVS...ending their lives by dehydrating them to death is not a morally licit way to do so...   I feel the duty to reaffirm strongly that the intrinsic value and personal dignity of every human being do not change, no matter what the concrete circumstances of his or her life. A man, even if seriously ill or disabled in the exercise of his highest functions, is and always will be a man, and he will never become a 'vegetable' or an 'animal'...

10	Does the Fraternal Birth Order Effect Demonstrate a Biological Basis to Sexual Orientation?	diverse samples and independent replications, homosexual men are found to have a greater number of older brothers than heterosexual men… [This] certainly does not provide a universal hypothesis for the origins of homosexuality since the majority of homosexual men do have this history and do not fit in this model. The hypothesis advanced in the above studies is that the late birth order, with more male siblings born earlier, could lead to a progressive immune response of the mother to androgens and/or Y-linked [male specific]… antigens which, by maternal transfer of these immune antibodies to the fetus, could impair brain masculinization of the fetus. However, why this mechanism would selectively impair only certain androgen-dependent processes, such as the brain programming, and not other, like formation of the genitalia, is not explained by this hypothesis, and not even addressed by the proponents. Nor does this theory explain why the majority of boys late in birth order do not become homosexual, even if the elder brother is homosexual… The biological explanation advanced for the fraternal birth order hypothesis lacks any experimental support.”

But once these plants are set up and running, they have lower operation and maintenance costs than conventional power on a yearly basis. No more regular fuel bills and only minimal expenses for upkeep of solar, for example, which has no movable parts that wear out and need to be replaced.   The price argument is also fallacious because we have never paid the real price for the power we use, which includes the cost to the environment and human health of the carbon pollution that fossil-fuel mining and burning generates...

10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Textbooks are a known entity, schools and publishers have developed pretty efficient mechanisms to getting teachers oriented to a new textbook. The iText [Apple’s brand of digital textbook] adds a need to train teachers on how to incorporate the devices into their classroom practice. On an annual basis once a teacher has incorporated a textbook into their lesson plans there is very little fine tuning until the book changes. With a digital text the content should update every year requiring tweaks and updates to the teacher’s plans. Current content is a huge advantage for the digital text and one of the prime reasons to consider moving in this direction. But from a budget standpoint it comes with a real cost that can’t be ignored… At every level except management the iPad texts are more expensive. The single biggest contributor to the imbalance is the iPad itself, followed by the network… We are likely to hear lots of bleating about engagement and how much the kids love to work with these devices. To which educators should respond with ‘great – where is the objective data on improved outcomes?’ As a long term advocate of ed-tech I hope the data supports the thesis, but until we see the proof, claims along these lines ought to be regarded as aspirational marketing… The next time some ignorant bloviator refers to ‘outrageously priced textbooks’ remind them that at six cents per day a textbook is about as efficient as you are going to get for high quality, well designed, instructionally sound, standards aligned, and globally permissioned materials.”

[68] A July 2008 peer-reviewed study shows that children under the age of eight absorb twice the amount of radiation into their brain tissue as adults due to their lower skull thickness.

10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	A right to health care could lower the quality and availability of disease screening and treatment. In countries with a universal right to health care certain disease treatment outcomes are worse than the United States. The US 5-year survival rate for all cancers is 67%, compared to 60% in Canada and 54% in the United Kingdom. [141] [142] [143] Annually, there are fewer cancer deaths per 100,000 people in the United States than in Australia, France, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom. [149] Out of OECD nations, the United States is ranked at number two for breast cancer survival, behind only Sweden, and at number three for stroke survival, behind only Japan and South Korea. [115] Statistics show that US cancer screening rates for cervical and colorectal (bowel) cancer are higher than those in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""I do not condone or encourage the use of any particular drugs, medicine, or illegal substances in any aspect of life...  The pressure associated with winning games, pleasing fans, and getting the big contract, led me, and others, to engage in behavior that would produce immediate results. This is the same pressure that leads the youth of today, other athletes and professionals, to engage in that same behavior. The time has come to address this issue and set the record straight about what risks are involved in that behavior...  As I sit here today I would be remiss if I did not again stress that I do not condone the use of any drugs or illegal substances...I hope that my message will be received as it is intended, that we, as professional athletes, are no better than anyone else. We just have a special ability that permits us to play ball. We should not be held up to any higher standard of behavior than any other mother or father."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would increase the price of consumer goods. A 2013 article by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago stated that if the minimum wage is increased, fast-food restaurants would pass on almost 100% of their increased labor costs on to consumers and that other firms may do the same. [2] A 2015 Purdue University study found that raising the wage of fast food restaurant employees to $15 or $22 per hour would result in a price increase of 4.3% and 25% respectively, or a reduction in product size between 12% and 70%: ""a hamburger would be much smaller,"" the researchers stated. [53] NBC News found that the price of a cup of coffee went up by 10 to 20% in Oakland, California, after a 36% minimum wage hike in the city to $12.25. The report also found a 6.7% rise in coffee prices in Chicago after the minimum wage rose to $10. [54] The Alberta Hotel and Lodging Association (Canada) found that a ""sudden and significant increase to the minimum wage"" would result in ""[i]ncreased prices for food & beverage, guest rooms and meeting facilities.""

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?	"""[T]he overwhelming majority of capital cases contain no credible evidence of innocence. In fact, most death row appeals are not even based on claims of factual innocence...  The facts show the vast majority of death row releases are based on legal technicalities, not real innocence!  Moreover, the entire contention about 'innocence' rests on the notion there is actually some evidence innocent people are being executed. This is nonsense! There is no such evidence anywhere - not even a single case of an innocent execution!...  We are all aware living murderers injure, maim and kill again, in prison, after improper release, and after escape. Whether one believes in the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent or not is irrelevant, one matter can't be contested: the murderer who is executed will never kill again.  Furthermore, it's important to note that in some states where a moratorium was instituted, the murder rate increased. For instance, in Texas, an unofficial moratorium on executions was implemented during most of 1996 and early 1997... [T]he state appeared to have spared few, if any, condemned prisoners, while the citizens of Texas experienced an added loss of 90 innocent lives to homicide, over and above what would have been expected had no moratorium been in place."""
01	Is Obamacare Leading to a Decline in Employment-Based Health Insurance? - DEBATED	"""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) will have profound implications for U.S. labor markets. The PPACA is fiscally dangerous, raising the risk of higher labor (and other) taxes at a time when the job market is struggling. It provides strong incentives for employers - and their employees – to drop employer-sponsored health insurance for as many as 35 million Americans, perhaps leading to widespread turmoil in labor compensation and employee insurance coverage."""

There are some patients whose proper care requires time and effort, professional services that aren't necessarily paid for by insurance companies. I might say, 'There has to be an easier way.' I could too easily find myself seeing euthanasia as the simple answer; one that is less time consuming and the least expensive.

10	What Are the Pros and Cons of Milk's Effect on Cancer?	"""Consuming milk increases levels of a growth hormone, IGF-1, in the body. Increased IGF-1 levels are strongly implicated in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, premenopausal breast cancer and lung cancer. The effect of milk on IGF-1 may be due to absorption of IGF-1 from the milk or may simply be due to the high protein and zinc content of the milk."""
01	Is Prostitution a Threat to Marriage?	"""The concept that 'mom's job' is having sex with strangers sets the wrong tone for family life. It hurts the woman, it hurts the children; that is an exploitative situation,. If prostitution is legal it affords men the 'excuse' to go find sex outside of marriage, when things in the marriage are difficult. That does nothing to enhance the relationship between a man and a woman.  [Prostitution] runs opposite to what relationships are supposed to be. Intimacy and love are not involved; it's just a purely physical act. It lowers both people to the lowest common denominator."""
10	Binge-Watching - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Binge-watching leads to mental health issues. A University of Texas study found that binge watchers were more likely to be depressed, lonely, and have less self-control. [15] One of the study's authors, Yoon Hi Sung, PhD, stated: ""When binge-watching becomes rampant, viewers may start to neglect their work and their relationships with others. Even though people know they should not, they have difficulty resisting the desire to watch episodes continuously."" [16] Binge watching can lead to addiction. Dr. Renee Carr, a clinical psychologist, said ""The neuronal pathways that cause heroin and sex addictions are the same as an addiction to binge watching. Your body does not discriminate against pleasure. It can become addicted to any activity or substances that consistently produces dopamine."" [8] Another study found that, rather than relieving stress, excessive TV watching is associated with regret, guilt, and feelings of failure because of a sense of wasted time and inactivity. [18] When that binge-watching session is over, the viewer may be more likely to ""mourn"" the loss of the show by experiencing depression, anxiety, and feelings of emptiness. [19] [20]"
01	Has DNA Testing Led to Significant Improvements in the Criminal Justice System?	"""The increasing use of DNA testing to help confirm the innocence or guilt in capital cases is one among many reforms that will help ensure that innocent people are not sentenced to death...  Unique to an individual (except in the case of identical twins and bone marrow transplant recipients), unchanging throughout one's life, and found in all one's cells, DNA is a reliable identifier. DNA testing on biological samples such as skin, saliva, semen, blood or hair can help convict or exonerate with great accuracy. But only if the biological evidence is properly collected, preserved and kept from contamination. And only if the analysis is done correctly. Under those conditions DNA testing is the modern improved version of fingerprinting."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Behind the facade of a regulated industry, brothel prostitutes in Nevada are captive in conditions analogous to slavery. Women often are procured for the brothels from other areas by pimps who dump them at the house in order to collect the referral fee. Women report working in shifts commonly as long as 12 hours, even when ill, menstruating or pregnant, with no right to refuse a customer who has requested them or to refuse the sexual act for which he has paid. The dozen or so prostitutes I interviewed said they are expected to pay the brothel room and board and a percentage of their earnings -- sometimes up to 50 percent. They also must pay for mandatory extras such as medical exams, assigned clothing and fines incurred for breaking house rules. And, contrary to the common claim that the brothel will protect women from the dangerous, crazy clients on the streets, rapes and assaults by customers are covered up by the management."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Advocates of a video game-aggression link point to meta-analyses as the strongest evidence for their view… But meta-analysis itself has come under scrutiny as of late… first, if you do an analysis of hundreds of poorly-designed studies, all you have is artfully-analyzed noise… Second, meta-analysis suffers from a phenomenon known as publication bias: because scientific papers that fail to find an anticipated result are almost never published… Setting all that aside, there is an additional, excellent reason to reject the video game-aggression hypothesis: over the last 30 years, video game sales have skyrocketed, and the games themselves have become both (a) more realistic, and (b) more violent… And yet, over the same period… violent crime has decreased substantially… If one were to ignore warnings against inferring correlation from causation, one might be tempted to conclude that violent video games actually reduce aggression.”
10	Universal Basic Income - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"UBI removes the incentive to work, adversely affecting the economy and leading to a labor and skills shortage. Earned income motivates people to work, to be successful, to cooperate with colleagues, and to gain skills; however, ""if we pay people, unconditionally, to do nothing... they will do nothing"" and this leads to a less effective economy, says Charles Wyplosz, PhD, Professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva (Switzerland). [33] Economist Allison Schrager, PhD, says that a strong economy relies on people being motivated to work hard, and in order to motivate people there needs to be an element of uncertainty for the future. UBI, providing guaranteed security, removes this uncertainty. [36] Elizabeth Anderson, PhD, Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the University of Michigan, says that a UBI would cause people ""to abjure work for a life of idle fun... [and] depress the willingness to produce and pay taxes of those who resent having to support them."" [17] In 2016, the Swiss government opposed implementation of UBI, stating that it would entice fewer people to work and thus exacerbate the current labor and skills shortages. [34] Guaranteed income trials in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s found that the people that received payments worked fewer hours. [9]"

10	Are Electronic Voting Machines Mechanically Reliable?	"""TrueVoteMD placed observers in 6% of Maryland polling places and observed 201 machine 'problems,' some of which included issues such as lack of proper help in using the machines. By my analysis, these 'problems' included 111 voting day machine malfunctions, or an 11.4% machine failure rate...  The 'unofficial' data is confirmed by evidence from official sources. The Maryland Board of Elections secretly placed all Maryland voting machines on lockdown following the 2004 General Election as a result of extensive machine failures experienced... The Maryland Board of Elections believes that a 7% failure rate of voting machines is normal. They may have determined this by comparison of their failure experience with that of other election administrators. A 7% rate may be a normal failure rate for voting machines that are designed and tested to a deeply inadequate specification, but it is seriously abnormal for properly specified, designed, and tested electronic equipment used in mission-critical applications."""
10	Should Net Neutrality Be Restored? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Net neutrality reduces investment in internet services resulting in less access and higher costs for consumers. Between 2011 and 2015, when neutrality rules were being debated by the FCC, the mere threat of implementing them reduced ISPs investments in network upgrades by 20-30%, a $150-$200 billion reduction in investment. [13] During the years that net neutrality rules were in place (2015-2017), investment in broadband fell for the first time ever in a non-recession period. [10][28] According to AT&T, that ""chilled investment in broadband,"" threatened ""to slow the delivery of broadband services to all Americans… particularly in rural America where broadband investment is needed the most."" [30] Net neutrality regulations also prevent ISPs from charging large content companies (such as video streaming services) additional fees to cover the costs of the massive bandwidth they use. Preventing such paid prioritization fees places the costs of building the additional capacity necessary to carry the content onto ISPs, and these costs will trickle down to consumers in the form of more expensive internet packages - which are paid by all, even those who don't use the streaming services.

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“As far as US drone strikes in Pakistan are concerned, they are tactically successful but strategically counterproductive. No doubt, these drone strikes have managed to kill high-profile terrorist leaders such as Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud. But look at the cost. If you look at the official figures collected by independent researchers, attempts to kill 41 militant commanders have resulted in the deaths of estimated 1,200 people. It means that for each militant commander the US has killed more than 30 civilians. So again collateral damage on such a high scale does not bode well for Pakistan’s national counter-terrorism policy that seeks to win over the population in conflict regions of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)… [T]errorist groups in Pakistan are fighting with an anti-American agenda. They justify their violence against the Pakistani state and society as result of Islamabad’s support for the US occupation of Afghanistan. So to undo this perception, the US must stop the drone strikes in the tribal areas of Pakistan and let the Pakistani state deal with these terrorist organizations with all its indigenous resources.”

ES&S supported nearly 1,800 jurisdictions in 43 states, representing 67 million registered voters... Given the scope of this election, and the dramatic change as a result of implementing HAVA, it was a very smooth day. Overall, the voting equipment functioned well, and results were reported within expected timeframes...  We and our election official partners across the country carried out the greatest transformation in the way elections are run since the Voting Rights Act of the 1960s.

"""Electricity is needed to give us light, to power our appliances, to power our televisions and computers, and to enable all of the work saving gadgets that we own. In order to meet these fundamental needs, we will need ever more energy, especially in the emerging economies of the world.

The large growth in global energy demand can only be met by relying on all of our energy resources. No single energy resource can meet such requirements. If we are to avoid energy shortages, we need to greatly expand our use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, renewables and conservation."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In Sweden, prostitution is officially acknowledged as a form of male sexual violence against women and children. One of the cornerstones of Swedish policies against prostitution and trafficking in human beings is the focus on the root cause, the recognition that without men's demand for and use of women and girls for sexual exploitation, the global prostitution industry would not be able flourish and expand.   Prostitution is a serious problem that is harmful, in particular, not only to the prostituted woman or child but also to society at large. Therefore, prostituted women and children are seen as victims of male violence who do not risk legal penalties. Instead, they have a right to assistance to escape prostitution."""
10	Are Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Cities, Counties, and States) Good Policy?	"""As the attorney general of the United States, I have a duty to protect public safety and uphold our nation's rule of law.

In others, political leaders have declared they will not turn over criminal aliens in their jails to federal agents for lawful deportation or even notify federal agents that they have made an arrest — preferring instead to release aliens who have committed crimes such as domestic violence, child abuse and rape back into their communities. Others are less blatant, simply refusing to honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. No matter what form these policies take, they all have the same effect: They harm public safety, by putting numerous criminal aliens back on our streets. They also undermine the rule of law, by signaling that our nation's immigration laws — laws passed by our representatives to serve our national interest — can be willfully ignored.   Supporters say 'sanctuary' policies help fight crime by encouraging illegal immigrants to report crimes without fear of deportation. But how can we fight crime by allowing criminal aliens whom the law requires to be deported to stay in our country? And how does it promote the rule of law when our citizens see their leaders disregard the law?"""

10	If There Is a Power Failure during an Election Conducted on Electronic Voting Machines Will Voting Still Be Possible?	"""Most touch screen voting machines have backup electrical power that is provided by means of an internal, rechargeable battery... Unfortunately, on the morning of an election, the batteries in these voting machines might be either partially or fully discharged. In some cases, voting machines may have batteries that are no longer able to take a charge if the machines have been stored for long in an unpowered state...  Many of these machines used sealed lead acid batteries, which will discharge over time. The longer they remain uncharged, the less able they are to be fully recharged...  In those cases where a battery has been fully discharged and is unable to take a charge, if the power goes out, the voting machine may shut down without any warning. If this occurs while voters are in the midst of casting their votes, they will be left in limbo, not knowing whether or not their vote has been cast. They will have no way of finding out until power is restored, and it is unlikely that they will be able to remain at the polling place waiting for that to happen. The votes of such voters will thus likely be lost."""

10	Does Legal Prostitution Lead to Human Trafficking and Slavery?	"""The intersection of the highly emotive issues of sex work and human trafficking generates a lot more heat than light. Some antitrafficking activists equate 'prostitution' with trafficking and vice versa, despite evidence to the contrary. The U.S. government leaves no doubt as to where it stands: According to the State Department Web site, 'Where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery.' By this logic, the state of Nevada should be awash in foreign sex slaves, leading one to wonder what steps the Justice Department is taking to free them. Oddly, the Netherlands, Australia, and Germany--all of whom have legalized prostitution--received top marks from the Bush administration in the most recent Trafficking in Persons Report.  Moreover, some efforts to prohibit prostitution have increased sex workers' risk to the dangers of trafficking, though largely because lawmakers neglected to consult the people the laws were designed to protect. Sweden, for example, is much praised by antiprostitution activists for a 1998 law that aimed to protect sex workers by criminalizing their customers. But several independent studies, including one conducted by the Swedish police, showed that it exposed prostitutes to more dangerous clients and less safe-sex practices."""
01	Under Obamacare, Does Medicare Reduce Reimbursements to Hospitals with High 30-Day Readmission Rates? - YES	"""More than 2,000 hospitals — including some nationally recognized ones — will be penalized by the government starting in October because many of their patients are readmitted soon after discharge, new records show.  Together, these hospitals will forfeit about $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year as the government begins a wide-ranging push to start paying health care providers based on the quality of care they provide.  With nearly one in five Medicare patients returning to the hospital within a month of discharge, the government considers readmissions a prime symptom of an overly expensive and uncoordinated health system. Hospitals have had little financial incentive to ensure patients get the care they need once they leave, and in fact they benefit financially when patients don't recover and return for more treatment.  Nearly 2 million Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days of release each year, costing Medicare $17.5 billion in additional hospital bills. The national average readmission rate has remained steady at slightly above 19 percent for several years, even as many hospitals have worked harder to lower theirs."""

10	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""In an effort to further their agenda of mass migration to and permanent legal settlement within the United States, these special interest groups are demanding that the U.S. adopt their interpretation of our nation's 14th Amendment:   Any child born on American soil shall be automatically granted full legal United States citizenship. Even if one or both parents are in the U.S. illegally, the child must still be given citizenship – and therefore have the right to later sponsor a large number of family members to live in the U.S. as legal immigrants.   This application of the law – which has been widely upheld by the U.S. court system and championed by an ever-more-accommodating federal government – is par for the course in a deteriorating immigration system that encourages massive population growth. Specifically, this interpretation of the 14th Amendment has given rise to the phenomenon known as 'Anchor Babies' – children whose parents intentionally give birth to them within the U.S. for the purpose of gaining citizenship. Once automatic birthright citizenship is assigned to the child, the 'anchor baby' is then later used to manipulate our nation's present chain migration policies – ensuring legal immigration privileges are granted to the child's parents, siblings, and even adult members of their extended family…   NPG has long held that our nation must adopt reasonable and responsible immigration policies, which includes the immediate clarification of the 14th Amendment to end the practice of automatic birthright citizenship."""

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	A diet that includes fish provides the body with essential omega-3 fatty acids. Fish are a powerful source of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA which are important for brain function, lowering triglycerides, and reducing the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes. [52] Although the omega-3 fatty acid ALA can be found in plant oils, the ALA must first be converted by the body into the essential EPA and DHA. The process is inefficient and may not provide the same cardiovascular benefits as eating fish. [53] Read More
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Morally, you have no right to demand medical care of me. I may recognize your necessity and offer charity; my friends and I may choose to band together and fund your medical care. But your necessity does not change the basic math: Medical care is a service and a good provided by a third party… [M]edical care is a commodity, and treating it otherwise is foolhardy. To make a commodity cheaper and better, two elements are necessary: profit incentive and freedom of labor. The government destroys both of these elements in the health-care industry. It decides medical reimbursement rates for millions of Americans, particularly poor Americans; this, in turn, creates an incentive for doctors not to take government-sponsored health insurance… So, what’s the solution for poor people? Not to declare medical care a ‘right,’ and certainly not to dismiss reliance on the market as perverse cruelty. Markets are the solution in medical care, just as they are in virtually every other area. Treating medical care as a commodity means temporary shortages, and it means that some people will not get everything we would wish them to have. But that’s also true of government-sponsored medical care, as the most honest advocates will admit. And whereas government-sponsored medical care requires a top-down approach that violates individual liberties, generates overdemand, and quashes supply, markets prize individual liberties, reduce demand (you generally demand less of what you must pay for), and heighten supply through profit incentive.”
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“[M]inimum legal drinking age of 21 is working. Alcohol consumption jumps sharply exactly at age 21 and remains elevated (i.e., more than a one-time birthday-related drinking celebration). Deaths jump sharply exactly at age 21 by about 9 percent and remain elevated. Arrests jump sharply exactly at age 21 and remain elevated. And hospitalizations jump sharply exactly at age 21 and remain elevated… Numerous policies and proposals have been put forth to address the troubling profile of excessive alcohol use by young people. Many of these need more research to demonstrate their effectiveness on a broad population-wide scale, but a minimum legal drinking age of 21 is not one of them.”
01	Should Executions Be Made Public?	"""In the 1830s and 1840s there was a strong, grass-roots movement pushing for the abolition of capital punishment. The states enacted 'private' execution laws, and there is evidence to suggest that these laws were enacted for the express purpose of limiting the public's access to the brutality of the death penalty. Following the enactment of these laws, opposition to capital punishment dropped, and the death penalty remains a part of the American criminal justice system 160 years later...  [T]he public has a right to view executions; therefore, the state may not prohibit the media from acting as the public's representative. This argument, however, has repeatedly failed in the courts, and efforts to televise executions ultimately have lost because the courts have characterized them as 'access cases'...   Because the media has no general constitutional right of access beyond that of the general public, private execution laws have been upheld. The historical evidence suggests, however, that these are not access cases. The restrictions on filming executions are neither content - nor viewpoint - neutral. For this reason, the public maintains a right to see an execution because the state may not prohibit public debate by suppressing a particular side or viewpoint on an issue."""
10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“The American Medical Association (AMA) has decided to classify obesity as a disease. This decision is another example of inventing illnesses – a favorite pastime of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) – and another step towards eroding people’s autonomy and making them passive participants in their health. It is also an example of how the medical establishment is laying the groundwork to bill Medicare and Medicaid for every bad choice anyone makes, ever. With the exception of when obesity is caused by a known pathology, such as hypothyroidism (which, while making weight loss more difficult, would certainly not completely prevent it), it is largely caused by poor decisions—like binging on food or eating lots of candy, ice cream or Cheetos… Last time I checked, there was no known gene that would make people veer off into the McDonald’s drive-through lane or direct them to choose whole milk over 1 percent milk. No known gene can make you raid the refrigerator at midnight. No known gene can make you drive past six gyms on your way to work and stop at none of them… The AMA, in classifying obesity as a disease, furthers the dependency, disempowerment and entitlement culture that is eroding scientific truth and personal autonomy in America.”
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“The [New York] Times cites our trade with China as a reason for ending the Cuban embargo, but this example merely illustrates that American policy has been inconsistent.

One day we will establish normal trading relations with Cuba, but that should not be before the people there govern themselves… The embargo has been working all along, and it is up to the Cuban dictators to relax their grip, not us.”

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The ACLU supports the decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of prostitution. The ACLU also condemns the abuse of vagrancy or loitering laws or licensing or regulatory schemes to harass and arrest those who may be engaged in solicitation for prostitution. While there are both male and female prostitutes, laws against prostitution most frequently refer to, or are applied to woman. Despite the statutory stress on female prostitution, the ACLU's policy is applicable to prostitutes of both sexes...   Such laws have traditionally represented one of the most direct forms of discrimination against women. The woman who engage in prostitution is punished criminally and stigmatized socially while her male customer, either by the explicit design of the statute or through a pattern of discriminatory enforcement is left unscathed.  Prostitution laws are also a violation of the right of individual privacy because they impose penal sanctions for the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. Whether a person chooses to engage in sexual activity for purposes of recreation, or in exchange for something of value, is a matter of individual choice, not for governmental interference. Police use of entrapment techniques to enforce laws against this essentially private activity is reprehensible. Similarly, the use of loitering and vagrancy laws to punish prostitutes for their status or to make arrests on the basis of reputation and appearance, is contrary to civilized notions of due process of law.   Since the ACLU policy is that prostitution should not be made criminal, solicitation for prostitution is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  The ACLU reaffirms its policy favoring removal of criminal penalties for prostitution and in support of total sexual freedom among consenting adults in private."""
01	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""Euthanasia a slippery slope that ends in involuntary euthanasia  Euthanasia was legalised in Belgium in 2002, where is defined as 'the intentional termination of a patient's life by a physician at the patient’s request', so that only voluntary euthanasia may be legally carried out in Belgium. However, this legal requirement of voluntarism is not always fulfilled.  Thus, a study conducted in Flanders in 1996 found that 3.3% of cases of euthanasia had occurred without the prior request of the patient. In other words, they were involuntary euthanasias. Another study (also in Flanders) found that there had been 1796 cases of involuntary euthanasias (3.2%). A more recent study from 2007 found that the percentage of involuntary euthanasia was 1.8%, while another in 2013 found 1.7%.  However — and we believe this is important — the percentage of involuntary euthanasia in patients who were 80-years-old or over rose to 52.7%, while in those with diseases other than cancer, this figure reached 67.5%.

01	"Does the ""Social Contract"" Theory Present a Valid Reason for Felon Disenfranchisement?"

A man who breaks the laws he has authorized his agent to make for his own governance could fairly have been thought to have abandoned the right to participate in further administering the compact. On a less theoretical plane, it can scarcely be deemed unreasonable for a state to decide that perpetrators of serious crimes shall not take part in electing the legislators who make the laws, the executives who enforce these, the prosecutors who must try them for further violations, or the judges who are to consider their cases. This is especially so when account is taken of the heavy incidence of recidivism and the prevalence of organized crime.

But unless they were turned on in your mother’s womb, they remained coiled up and silent… So what conditions in the uterus turn on those gay genes? So for a male, your chances of homosexuality increase in proportion to the number of previous baby boys who inhabited your mother’s uterus. So for every older biological brother you have, your chances of being born gay go up 33%. Long before we invented the pill, nature devised homosexuality as a prescription for birth control. After four straight heterosexual males, nature says: ‘enough already!’, and the mom’s immune system switches on the epigenetic switch so a gay male is born into the family. This one will be not be overburdening the clan with yet more mouths to feed in the next generation. Sometimes more isn’t better. And he’s not going to be killing his brother in a fight over who gets the girl… Another gene, this one on the X chromosome, is called a male loving gene. Because when it shows up in a female, she tends to mate early and have a lot of kids. But when the male loving gene shows up in a male, it predisposes to homosexuality. So this is another gene that balances a family destined to have a large brood of kids and grandkids with an occasional gay son whose natural tendency to promote togetherness could improve the chances of survival for the whole family… I have no doubt that female homosexuality is also a natural variation that is advantageous for the family and the community.”

When you think about this at the population level, you can see why it’s of tremendous worry to increase access to a drug that the public believes is benign but, in fact, likely reduces motivation and drive… Do we want to be a nation of stoned people in an era of globalization in which competition is fierce?

'Aliens,' in popular culture suggests nonhuman beings invading from outer space — completely foreign, not one of us, intent on taking over our land and our way of life. Along these lines, the word 'invasion' is used by the Minutemen and right-wing bloggers to discuss the wave of people crossing the border.

10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	"More gun control is not needed; education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths. 95% of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. [154] Guns don't kill people; people kill people. And people need more gun education and mental illness screening to prevent massacres.The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, Inc (SAAMI), stated, ""Whether in the field, at the range or in the home, a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind."" [82] Heidi Cifelli, Former Program Manager of the NRA's Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program, stated, ""Gun education is the best way to save young lives."" [83] The NRA states that the Eddie Eagle program is not meant to ""teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children… Like swimming pools, electrical outlets, matchbooks, and household poison, they're [guns] treated simply as a fact of everyday life."" [84] According to Kyle Wintersteen, Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo, studies show that ""children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns"" and ""children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security, and recreation—not violence.""

01	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""Antidoping policies exist, in theory, to encourage fair play. However, we believe they are unfounded, dangerous, and excessively costly...  We believe that rather than drive doping underground, use of drugs should be permitted under medical supervision.  Legalisation of the use of drugs in sport might even have some advantages. The boundary between the therapeutic and ergogenic - ie, performance enhancing - use of drugs is blurred at present and poses difficult questions for the controlling bodies of antidoping practice and for sports doctors. The antidoping rules often lead to complicated and costly administrative and medical follow-up to ascertain whether drugs taken by athletes are legitimate therapeutic agents or illicit...  Furthermore, legalisation of doping, we believe, would encourage more sensible, informed use of drugs in amateur sport, leading to an overall decline in the rate of health problems associated with doping. Finally, by allowing medically supervised doping, the drugs used could be assessed for a clearer view of what is dangerous and what is not...  Acknowledging the importance of rules in sports, which might include the prohibition of doping, is, in itself, not problematic. However, a problem arises when the application of these rules is beset with diminishing returns: escalating costs and questionable effectiveness."""

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Killing animals and eating meat have been significant components of human evolution that had a synergistic relationship with other key attributes that have made us human, with larger brains, smaller guts, bipedalism and language. Larger brains benefited from consuming high-quality proteins in meat-containing diets, and, in turn, hunting and killing of large animals, butchering of carcasses and sharing of meat have inevitably contributed to the evolution of human intelligence in general and to the development of language and of capacities for planning, cooperation and socializing in particular… [T]here is no doubt that the human digestive tract has clearly evolved for omnivory, not for purely plant-based diets. And the role of scavenging, and later hunting, in the evolution of bipedalism and the mastery of endurance running cannot be underestimated, and neither can the impact of planned, coordinated hunting on non-verbal communication and the evolution of language… Meat consumption is a part of our evolutionary heritage; meat production has been a major component of modern food systems; carnivory should remain, within limits, an important component of a civilization that finally must learn how to maintain the integrity of its only biosphere.”

To insist on having paper ballots produced on electronic voting machines for the sole purpose of recounting them is to value the 'means' to the exclusion of the 'end'... there are other 'means' to achieve the 'end' of accurate and error free elections. The characteristics of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems reduce or eliminate the risk of many of the errors that can occur in counting paper-based ballots...

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Some assert that this 'profession' can be empowering and that legalizing and regulating all aspects of prostitution will mitigate the harm that accompanies it. But I cannot accept a policy prescription that codifies such a pernicious form of violence against women. Normalizing the act of buying sex also debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. If paying for sex is normalized, then every young boy will learn that women and girls are commodities to be bought and sold...  [I]f full legalization is adopted, it will not be the 'empowered sex worker' who will be the norm — it will be the millions of women and girls needed to fill the supply of bodies that an unlimited market of consumers will demand. Where do we think these young girls in the sex trade will come from? (Most victims are girls, though some boys are exploited, too.) It is simply naive to oppose sex trafficking of children and women and at the same time support decriminalizing the buyers who create the demand and the pimps who profit from the supply of girls and women.  I believe it is better to help women and girls avoid a life of prostitution and to deter men from buying sex acts."""

01	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""Nuclear energy has perhaps the lowest impact on the environment — including air, land, water, and wildlife — of any energy source. It produces no harmful greenhouse gases, isolates its waste from the environment, and requires less area to produce the same amount of electricity as other sources.  Because nuclear energy has such a small impact on its surroundings, nuclear power plants provide excellent habitat for all species of plants and animals to thrive. Water discharged from a nuclear power plant contains no harmful pollutants and meets regulatory standards for temperature designed to protect aquatic life. This water, used for cooling, never comes in contact with radioactive materials.  Since the areas around nuclear power plants are so clean, they are often developed as wetlands that allow trees, flowers, and grasses to thrive and provide nesting areas for waterfowl and other birds. Many energy companies have created special nature parks or wildlife sanctuaries on plant sites.  Nuclear energy is safe and secure. Strict government regulations, continuous training by the industry, and enhanced security measures have combined to ensure safety inside and outside of America's nuclear power plants...  Many fear that nuclear energy plants pose a safety hazard since they might emit radiation. However, the truth is that nuclear power plants are a minuscule source of radiation. Because of their advanced design and sophisticated containment structures, U.S. nuclear plants emit a negligible amount of radiation...You would have to live near a nuclear power plant for over 2,000 years to get the same amount of radiation exposure that you get from a single diagnostic medical x-ray. Even if you lived right next door to a nuclear power plant, you would still receive less radiation each year than you would receive in just one round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles."""

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""To end abuses in the sex industry, the Netherlands decided to change the law to reflect everyday reality. It is now legal to employ prostitutes who are over the age of consent, and do the work voluntarily, but stricter measures have been introduced under criminal law to prevent exploitation.   The legalisation of brothels enables the government to exercise more control over the sex industry and counter abuses. The police conduct frequent controls of brothels and are thus in a position to pick up signs of human trafficking. This approach is in the interests of prostitutes themselves, and it facilitates action against sexual violence and abuse and human trafficking...  An important spin-off of the policy is that it prevents human trafficking, which is characterised by exploitation, coercion and violence. The lifting of the ban on brothels makes prostitution a legitimate occupation and gives prostitutes the same rights and protection as other professionals.  The labour laws offer the most effective protection against exploitation, violence and coercion. The policy is based on the conviction that strengthening the position of women is the best way to combat sexual violence. Moreover, abuses are easier to detect when prostitutes operate publicly and legally rather than in a clandestine subculture."""

01	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Glaucoma?	may be prescribed to control the pressure, but cannabis is also very effective at reducing the [intraocular] pressure thus preventing damage that can lead to blindness. The THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), CBD (Cannabidiol) and other cannabinoids present in medicinal marijuana have an advantage over pharmaceuticals as the variety of cannabinoids is superior to synthetic, single-ingredient medications. The reason most cited by opponents of using cannabis as a treatment for glaucoma is that to maintain the therapeutic effect a patient must smoke frequently which may have long term effects on the lungs. Yet, with the wide availability of edibles which last considerably longer and vaporizers, this is not reason enough to disregard marijuana altogether. There are many pharmaceutical options for the treatment of glaucoma, but they may lose effectiveness over time while cannabis has a consistent effect. While there is no known cure, cannabis is an effective treatment for glaucoma.”

That is why all the world’s commercial fisheries are collapsing… Most people don’t want to see where their meat comes from. They also don’t want to know what the impact of their meat has on the ecology. They would rather deny the whole thing and pretend meat is something that comes in packages from the store… Eating meat and fish is not only bad for the environment it’s also unhealthy. Yet even when it comes to our own health we slip into denial and order the Whopper.

My own view is, if you have come here illegally and stayed here illegally, that you don't get a path to citizenship...   I think legal status is a possibility, for sure. I think their children maybe can become citizens. But my own view is it isn't fair to say to people who have played by the rules -- and it takes a long time to play by the rules -- that, you know, it just doesn't matter.”"
01	Is Certain Free Preventive Care Required under Obamacare? – YES	"""Obamacare guarantees coverage of preventive services with no cost sharing. Preventive care promotes health and saves money. Yet many preventive care services are out of women's reach due to high co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance. More than 50 percent of women have delayed seeking medical care due to cost, and one-third of women report forgoing basic necessities to pay for health care. But under the health reform law, insurers are now required to cover recommended preventive services such as mammograms, Pap smears, and well-baby care without cost sharing. More than 45 million women have already taken advantage of these services. And starting this August more services, including contraception, gestational diabetes screening, and breastfeeding supports, will be added to the list of preventive care that must be covered at no additional cost."""

01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The one-state solution is a dangerous and mistaken illusion.  I believe that the State of Israel is the self determination of the Jewish Nation, a state for all citizens, and a state which grants communal rights to National minorities within it. Just as I defend Israel's right to exist, despite my criticism, I also struggle for the establishment of a Palestinian state that will put into practice Palestinians' right to Statehood.  The demand to release Palestinians from the oppression of the Occupation is not only a human rights demand. Rather, it is a demand for the end of the conflict, for a division of land based on an agreement, in the spirit of the Arab League and Geneva Initiatives. The suggestion to establish one state, both when it comes from the radical left or from the right, will not only deter from reaching peace but will establish a new conflict over control over the one state.  Unlike them, I want to end the occupation, but not to end the state of Israel. I want to change the state I'm living it [sic], but I don't want to give up our independence. I believe that the Palestinians wouldn't want to give up the hope for their own nation-state as well."""
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""In many states it is now legal to euthanize disabled persons by starvation and dehydration without any evidence of their wishes based on the 'best interest' form of substituted judgement...

01	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""[I]n this profit-driven economic climate, is it realistic to expect that insurers are going to do the right thing, or the cheap thing? If insurers deny, or even delay, approval of costlier life-saving alternatives, then money saving but fatal measures become the deadly default.  The truth is that assisted suicide as public policy is rife with dangerous loopholes and consequences, especially for the vulnerable in our society.

"""It is my view that even the physician with the most profound moral scruples against physician-assisted suicide can, in certain circumstances, incur an obligation to provide this assistance... I hasten to add that I support the legal recognition of opt-out provisions... But that does not mean that a physician has no moral obligation to help, even if there is no legal one... Where the patient's request really does originate in autonomy and in the claim to mercy, it does mean that the physician is obligated not to entrap the patient into compliance with the physician's values rather than the patient's own values."""
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Compared with a wide range of other programs and efforts to reduce drinking among teenagers, increasing the legal age for purchase and consumption of alcohol to 21 appears to have been the most successful effort to date. The magnitude of effects of the age-21 policy may appear small, particularly in studies using weak research designs and having low levels of statistical power. However, even modest effects applied to the entire population of youth result in very large societal benefits… [T]he large proportion of MLDA (minimum legal drinking age) studies that found a significant inverse relationship with various outcomes gives strong support for the effectiveness of the MLDA.”
10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Unfortunately, it is highly questionable whether a government campaign to spur 'green jobs' would have net economic benefits. Indeed, the distortionary impacts of government intrusion into energy markets could prematurely force business to abandon current production technologies for more expensive ones. Furthermore, there would likely be negative economic consequences from forcing higher-cost alternative energy sources upon the economy. These factors would likely increase consumer energy costs and the costs of a wide array of energy intensive goods, slow GDP growth and ironically may yield no net job gains. More likely, they would result in net job losses."""
10	"Does the ""Social Contract"" Theory Present a Valid Reason for Felon Disenfranchisement?"	"""Despite its initial attractiveness, the use of social contract theory to defend felon disenfranchisement is in fact specious. Under a regime of disenfranchisement, an individual who breaches the social contract continues to be bound by the terms of the contract even after being stripped of the ability to take part in political decisions. However, contract doctrine does not allow an injured party to force the breacher to perform its contractual duties without the injured party performing its own. The contract can be terminated or the injured party can accept the performance, but the injured party cannot simply pick and choose which terms will remain and which will not...  Social contract theory and the objectives of punishment fail to provide a satisfactory explanation for the denial of one of the most fundamental rights to millions of citizens."""
01	Are Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Cities, Counties, and States) Good Policy?	"""Crime is lower and economies are stronger in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties. The data support arguments made by law enforcement executives that communities are safer when law enforcement agencies do not become entangled in federal immigration enforcement efforts. The data also make clear that, when counties protect all of their residents, they see significant economic gains. By keeping out of federal immigration enforcement, sanctuary counties are keeping families together—and when households remain intact and individuals can continue contributing, this strengthens local economies. These effects appear particularly pronounced in smaller counties, as removing one person from the economy of a small population has a larger effect than removing one person from the economy of a large population."""

10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“[T]he very idea that health care — or any good provided by others — is a ‘right’ is a contradiction. The rights enshrined in the Declaration of Independence were to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Each of these is a right to act, not a right to things… These two concepts of rights — rights as the right to liberty, versus rights as the rights to things — cannot coexist in the same respect at the same time… To reform our health care industry we should challenge the premises that invited government intervention in the first place. The moral premise is that medical care is a right. It is not. There was no ‘right’ to such care before doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies produced it. There is no ‘right’ to anything that others must produce, because no one may claim a ‘right’ to force others to provide it. Health care is a service, and we all depend upon thinking professionals for it. To place doctors under hamstringing bureaucratic control is to invite poor results.”
01	Does Ethanol Generate More Energy Than the Amount Needed to Produce It?	"""Each gallon of corn ethanol today delivers as much as 67% more energy than is used to produce the ethanol.  Over the last two decades, the amount of energy needed to produce corn ethanol has decreased because of improved farming techniques, more efficient use of fertilizers and pesticides, higher-yielding crops, and advances in conversion technology.  Today, ethanol has a positive energy balance. That is, the energy content of corn ethanol is greater than the energy used to produce it."""
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The solution lies not in appeasing the maximalist territorial demands of the Palestinians, but in truly creating 'two states for two peoples'…  Therefore, for a lasting and fair solution, there needs to be an exchange of populated territories to create two largely homogeneous states, one Jewish Israeli and the other Arab Palestinian. Of course, this is not to preclude that minorities will remain in either state where they will receive full civil rights."""
01	Is the United States a Christian Nation?	"""Americans have always been extremely religious and overwhelmingly Christian. The 17th-century settlers founded their communities in America in large part for religious reasons. Eighteenth-century Americans saw their Revolution in religious and largely biblical terms. The Revolution reflected their 'covenant with God' and was a war between 'God's elect' and the British 'Antichrist...'   Americans tend to have a certain catholicity toward religion: All deserve respect. Given this general tolerance of religious diversity, non-Christian faiths have little alternative but to recognize and accept America as a Christian society."""
10	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Epilepsy (Seizures)?	documentation of the effectiveness of Cannabis sativa as an antiepileptic medication is severely limited at this time. Some accounts show a reduction in seizure frequency and/or severity for some people with epilepsy. Whether this is due to anticonvulsant properties of cannabis or to a reduction in physical and/or psychological stress levels is not fully known and cannot be clarified without further comprehensive scientific scrutiny…. Like any drug, cannabis probably has potential to both harm and heal. Without bone-fide scientific investigation and evaluation, the efficacy of Cannabis sativa as an antiepileptic drug cannot be safely or surely ascertained…. Since THC has dual effects and there are unknown properties of marijuana, marijuana is NOT recommended for people with epilepsy. Reliable documentation of the effectiveness of marijuana as an anti-epileptic medication is extremely limited at this time. While some accounts show a reduction in seizure frequency and/or severity in some people who have epilepsy, others suggest that marijuana may actually trigger seizures. Further investigation is needed to determine the effectiveness and side effects of cannabis as an anti-seizure drug.”
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence says in part: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.’ Nowhere does it mention anything about free MRIs… In school, we were taught that the first 10 amendments to the Constitution were ratified in 1791, and collectively they form our Bill of Rights… Rights are not about giving you something for free; they are about protecting natural liberties from those who would take them away from you. For instance, the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms. It does not however, say that you get guns for free if you don’t have one. This is analogous to the issue of health care ‘rights.’ A ‘right’ to services without charge, that forces someone else to provide for you, does not and should not ever exist. No one in a free society should have a ‘right’ to anything that requires others to toil against their will on behalf of those unwilling to provide for themselves.”
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Few would dispute the Palestinian entitlement to a state, but it simply cannot be achieved given the present reality. It was always folly to pursue the two-state solution in a context that militated against its ever happening. Today's Israel-Palestine is demonstrably one state, impossible to divide. But it is a discriminatory state operating an apartheid-style system against the Palestinians with impunity. Gross economic inequality is one indicator of this system.   This situation demands a new Palestinian strategy, a Plan B that converts the Palestinian struggle for two states into one for equal rights within what is now a unitary state ruled by Israel. The first step in this plan requires a dismantlement of the PA as currently constituted, or at least a change of direction for the Palestinian leadership…  The PA's new relationship with Israel should be restricted to pursuing the rights of its occupied people, including the right to political resistance. The PA should lead the campaign to prepare Palestinians for the abandonment of the two-state idea and the struggle for equal rights instead. Without a middleman to hide behind, the reality of Israel's occupation will be exposed, and the logic of a civil rights struggle will be inarguable."""
10	Is the Death Penalty Immoral?	"""Defenders of capital punishment can be separated into two different camps. Some are retributivists. Following Immanuel Kant, they claim that for the most heinous forms of wrongdoing, the penalty of death is morally justified or perhaps even required.  Other defenders of capital punishment are consequentialists and often also welfarists. They contend that the deterrent effect... is significant and that it justifies the infliction of the ultimate penalty. Consequentialist... tend to assume that capital punishment is (merely) morally permissible, as opposed to being morally obligatory...  We suggest... that on certain empirical assumptions, capital punishment may be morally required, not for retributive reasons, but rather to prevent the taking of innocent lives. In so saying, we are suggesting the possibility that states are obliged to maintain the death penalty option..."""
10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Those states that permit the sale and consumption of raw milk report more outbreaks of foodborne disease attributed to raw milk than those states that have stricter regulations. During 1973-1992, raw milk was implicated in 46 reported outbreaks. Nearly 90% of these outbreaks (40 out of 46) occurred in states that allow the sale of raw milk…   Because illnesses associated with raw milk continue to occur, additional efforts are needed to educate consumers and dairy farmers about illnesses associated with raw milk and raw colostrum. To reduce the risk for E. coli O157 and other infections, consumers should not drink raw milk or raw milk products.""  [Editor's Note: In March, 2012, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report titled ""Nonpasteurized Dairy Products, Disease Outbreaks, and State Laws - United States, 1993-1996"" (268KB), which concluded: ""Public health officials at all levels should continue to develop innovative methods to educate consumers and caregivers about the dangers associated with nonpasteurized dairy products.

10	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""For those who are skeptical that these findings are true, consider the case of El Paso, Texas a working class city of approximately 700,000 people that sits opposite the Rio Grande river from Ciudad Juarez, one of the most violent and lawless cities in Mexico. More than 80% of El Paso's residents are Hispanic and the vast majority of these individuals are of Mexican origin. A large population of El Paso's Hispanic population are immigrants. In fact, El Paso has one of the highest proportions of immigrants among U.S. cities. Many of these migrants are undocumented. If those who fear Mexican immigration are right, then El Paso should be a hotbed of violence. As it turns out, El Paso is one of the safest cities in the United States with a homicide rate of 2.4 per 100,000 residents. Just a tiny handful of American cities have a lower homicide rate and most of those that do (San Diego, Chula Vista, and Mesa, AZ, for example) also have outsize Mexican populations. Incredibly El Paso's homicide rate is so low that it compares favorably to European capitals like London, Paris and Amsterdam, cities which have rates of lethal violence that are generally an order of magnitude lower than cities in the United States.  To summarize, while it is right for Americans to be concerned about the equality of the immigrants we attract, there is simply no evidence to support that Mexican immigration should be a cause for concern. If anything, there is quite a bit of evidence that the immigrants we attract from Mexico serve to make us safer than we otherwise would be."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“The Court created a national right to same-sex marriage that doesn’t exist in our Constitution, it hijacked the democratic process, subverting the will of Americans in more than 30 states who voted to protect traditional marriage, and trampling on America’s most fundamental right — religious liberty… No man — and certainly no un-elected judge — has the right to redefine the laws of nature or of nature’s God. Government is not God. The purpose of marriage is to socially and biologically unite a man and a woman to create the next generation and to train the next generation to become their replacements. Marriage is a sacred covenant, not just another social contract.”
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""To promote job growth and help to restore the federal government to fiscal balance, we, the undersigned, feel that it would be beneficial to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148). Too many Americans remain unemployed and the United States faces a daunting budgetary outlook. We believe the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a threat to U.S. businesses and will place a crushing debt burden on future generations of Americans...  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains expensive mandates and penalties that create major barriers to stronger job growth... The law also levies roughly $500 billion in new taxes that will enter the supply chain for medical services, raising the cost of medical services... these medical costs will translate to higher insurance premiums, further increasing the cost of operating a business in the United States...  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not constitute real health care reform... Congress should start with a clean sheet of paper and adopt initiatives that would encourage providers to offer higher-quality care at lower costs; reduce the cost pressures that threaten to bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid; and give every American access to more options for quality insurance."""

Before PPACA was enacted, health plans could — and often did — rescind policies when an enrollee became sick, if he or she — or her employer — made an unintentional mistake in filling out the paperwork.  PPACA also requires plans, if they do rescind a policy, to provide a minimum 30 days' notice to the enrollee."""
01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“If we tax churches, then we will need to tax all not-for-profit organizations. Government may exempt churches from property taxes and other taxes so long as they do so for other charities. There are some who argue that, as in the case of religious groups on public campuses (Rosenberger v UVA), government can’t select just religious groups to tax while leaving all other organizations like schools, women shelters, soup kitchens, and fraternal organizations tax-exempt… To tax churches, government would need to have the (currently unconstitutional) authority to audit and regulate churches. Income is revenue minus expenses. So, to tax revenue, the government has rules about what counts as legitimate business expenses and regulations on how businesses perform their accounting. The government may also audit organizations. To do this for churches means that the government would define what is and is not legitimate and then act to ensure compliance. This raises a constitutional issue as Congress cannot make laws that affect the free exercise of religion.”
10	Is Nuclear Power Cost-Effective?	"""[T]he economics of nuclear power are not sound – in open markets nuclear cannot compete. Since splitting atoms is not a cost-effective source of electric power, it is even less cost-effective in preventing greenhouse gas emissions. Life cycle costs for nuclear power generation (in the USA) have been estimated at 12 cents a kilowatt hour, whereas life cycle costs for wind power in the same analysis is estimated at 4 cents a kilowatt hour. Others find that expanding nuclear generating capacity is about twice as expensive as expanding generating capacity through investment in wind power...  Wind energy is the fastest growing form of electric power generation in the world. This technology leads the portfolio of renewable energy options, and solar power is also making enormous strides with significant annual drops in cost of photovoltaic hardware.  In the USA, the ongoing waste of electric power makes investment in energy efficiency protocols and hardware an even more cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions."""
10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“Tax advantages to churches and religious organizations should be curtailed and brought in line with those granted to secular charitable groups. Whatever public good might stem from some religious activity, it is no greater than that accomplished by secular groups. They should be treated equally. A tax benefit should be justified by public accountability. Churches should be required to notify the I.R.S. of their intent to claim church status, to pay the same filing fees and submit the onerous annual 990 form, and reporting income and expenses, like all other 501(c)(3) groups. The current law gives unfair advantages to churches, which, unlike other nonprofits, do not have to disclose their financial activities. This lack of governmental oversight and accountability opens the door to scams, crime, con artists and abuse by people working under ‘church status’ that is much too common… The horrible massacre at Jonestown, Guyana, for example, could not have occurred had the Rev. Jim Jones been held accountable to the government while amassing his armory, drugs, wealth and control over minors.”

A study found an 83% increase in fatal crashes involving children and a 55% increase in pedestrian fatal crashes when Halloween falls on a weeknight. [6] There's been an increase of at least 21 fatal crashes every time the holiday fell on a Friday since 1994. [6] Safe Kids Worldwide stated, ""Twice as many kids are killed while walking on Halloween than any other day of the year."" [7] 82% of parents don't add high visibility aids such as reflective tape or glow sticks to their kids' costumes, and 63% of trick-or-treaters don't carry flashlights, according to the Halloween & Costume Association, an organization that created a petition to move Halloween to Saturdays signed by over 150,000 people. [8] Moving Halloween to a Saturday would allow trick-or-treating to begin in the daylight hours, reducing risk of fatal crashes and eliminating the need for costume safety alterations and flashlights. [9] The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said fatal crashes can occur on Halloween when trick-or-treaters dart out into the street unexpectedly. [10] Communities could create safer walking conditions on a Saturday Halloween by blocking off selected roads, which wouldn’t be practical on weeknights when people are returning home from work.

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	Lowering the drinking age will invite more use of illicit drugs among 18-21 year olds. A peer-reviewed study from the Journal of Studies of Alcohol and Drugs found that the younger a person begins to drink alcohol the more likely it is that they will use other illicit drugs.

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Electricity is needed to give us light, to power our appliances, to power our televisions and computers, and to enable all of the work saving gadgets that we own. In order to meet these fundamental needs, we will need ever more energy, especially in the emerging economies of the world. This again translates to a very rapid growth in global energy demand, especially the demand for electricity. In the U.S. alone, electricity demand is expected to double by mid-century...  The large growth in global energy demand can only be met by relying on all of our energy resources. No single energy resource can meet such requirements. If we are to avoid energy shortages, we need to greatly expand our use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, renewables and conservation."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“As a society, we don’t condone behavior that puts others at risk for injury or death. There are no exemptions for laws that prohibit drunk-driving, for example. Refusing vaccination for reasons other than a serious medical condition is unfair and dangerous to those who can’t protect themselves. Those who remain unvaccinated pose a great risk to many, including: all children under 1 year old who are too young to be vaccination, older adults who don’t know their immunity has lapsed and others with impaired immune systems… Eliminating personal belief exemptions will prevent suffering and save lives.

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Prostitution should not be a crime. Prostitutes are not committing an inherently harmful act. While the spread of disease and other detriments are possible in the practice of prostitution, criminalization is a sure way of exacerbating rather than addressing such effects. We saw this quite clearly in the time of alcohol prohibition in this country...   I would like the government to decriminalize prostitution but to regulate it in the way that other intimate service professions (such as massage therapists and doctors) are regulated on the basis of hygiene-related concerns.   One thing I would add is that there is a double-standard that permeates the enforcement of laws against prostitution. The prostitutes are harassed, arrested, and sometimes prosecuted, while the johns (and often the pimps, who are far more likely to be engaged in violent and master/slave-like treatment of the prostitutes) are ignored. This reflects the view that men who traffic in women are not as bad as the women in whom they traffic. If people are honestly concerned about the wellbeing of women in this profession, then they must begin by removing the status of 'outlaw' from these women so that they can come forward and receive help if and when they feel they want to leave a profession that can otherwise be quite difficult to escape."""

10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	believe marijuana should be illegal in our country. It is the pathway to drug usage by our society, which is a great scourge — which is one of the great causes of crime in our cities. And I believe that we are at a state where, of course, we are very concerned about people who are suffering pain, and there are various means of providing pain management. And those that have had loved ones that have gone through an end of life with cancer know the nature of real pain. I watched my wife’s mom and dad, both in our home, both going through cancer treatment, suffering a great deal of pain. But they didn’t have marijuana, and they didn’t need marijuana because there were other sources of pain management that worked entirely effectively. I’m told there is even a synthetic marijuana as well that is available. But having legalized marijuana, in my view, is an effort by a very committed few to try and get marijuana out into the public and ultimately legalize marijuana. It’s a long way to go. We need less drugs in this society, not more drugs, and I would oppose the legalization of marijuana in the country or legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes because pain management is available from other sources.”

Another net 2.5 million people enrolled in private health insurance during that time, but the new plans available in the Obamacare exchanges – while technically private – look and function more like Medicaid plans with limited networks, low physician reimbursement, and high public costs...  Obamacare has added enormously to public health spending, and as a result, more people have lower-quality health plans...  Instead of changing the private market to look more like a substandard government program, we should have gone in the opposite direction, encouraging reforms to Medicaid and our entire health care system to foster greater competition and choice, so that everyone has the opportunity to buy quality, affordable, reliable health coverage."""
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	"A right to health care could lead to government rationing of medical services. Countries with universal health care, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, [97] and the United Kingdom, [88] all ration health care using methods such as controlled distribution, budgeting, price setting, and service restrictions. [104] In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) rations health care using a cost-benefit analysis. For example, in 2018 any drug that provided an extra one year of good-quality life for about $25,000 or less was generally deemed cost-effective while one that costs more might not be. [139] In order to expand health coverage to more Americans, Obamacare created an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make cost-benefit analyses to keep Medicare spending from growing too fast. According to Sally Pipes, President of the Pacific Research Institute, the IPAB ""is essentially charged with rationing care."" [89] According to a Wall Street Journal editorial, ""once health care is nationalized, or mostly nationalized, medical rationing is inevitable."" [98] Read More"
10	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“Almost every bad thing and downward trend that has transpired in American political culture during the past 36 years happened because of Ronald Reagan’s inspiration and example. He taught us that government is always the problem (unless it’s the military or CIA…); that government spending is always wasteful (unless it’s military spending or subsidies or incentives for big business interests…); that poor people are moochers and frauds…; that we should worship wealth and punish the poor, and that minorities should be ignored or imprisoned… Ronald Reagan helped shift the tax burden from wealth to work, he helped hollow out the middle class, his War on Drugs helped launch the current era of mass incarceration that ruined millions of lives and destroyed countless communities and neighborhoods, his insane tax policies helped create today’s new Gilded Age of out-of-control wealth inequality, and his enthusiastic support for some of the worst people on Earth helped lead to the deaths of thousands of Americans. Ronald Reagan wasn’t brilliant; he was just really, really lucky – he was wrong about lots of things, but he still managed to bumble his way through without starting World War III. He wasn’t a visionary; he was a one-trick pony who kept peddling the same tired Cold War ideas that had bogged America down for decades. He wasn’t brave; he was willfully oblivious. He wasn’t judicious; by indiscriminately backing whatever ‘anti-communist’ military factions he could find, he helped unwittingly lay the groundwork for 9/11 and today’s Age of Terror.”
10	Has Obamacare Improved Medicaid? - DEBATED	"""In 2014, nearly all of Obamacare's net effect on insurance coverage resulted from increases in the failing Medicaid program. This happened even though only about half of states chose to expand their Medicaid programs under the law...   One of Obamacare's most perverse features is that the federal government now reimburses states substantially more for providing Medicaid services to able-bodied, working-age adults than for the disabled and for low-income children, pregnant women, and seniors. These were the people traditionally covered by Medicaid. This funding mechanism could lead states to provide generous services to some people, while skimping on care for the truly needy.   Medicaid suffered from serious problems prior to Obamacare's enactment. These included: escalating spending increases; low provider participation; poor quality of care; large crowd-out of private sector coverage; and perverse incentives that discouraged working and saving. The program needed major reform, not a blanket expansion...  Americans enrolled in Medicaid have less access to health care. When they do receive care, the quality is often inferior."""
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“[T]he US embargo is the only leverage the US has against the Castro dictatorship. As history indicates, the countries that have normalized relations and business dealings with the Castro government are severely limited in their ability to demand respect for human rights on the island. When these countries have attempted to pressure the Cuban dictatorship into stopping their repressive tactics, their economic interests on the island are immediately threatened. Therefore, their decision to promote respect for human rights in Cuba ceases to be a moral one and becomes an economic decision instead. Since, because of the embargo, the US has zero investments on the island that can be threatened, it can maintain its firm stance on human rights and democracy for the Cuban people.”
01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“I’ve often said, If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be vegetarian… Animals raised on modern factory farms and killed in slaughterhouses endure almost unimaginable suffering, I hope that once you see the routine cruelty involved in raising, transporting, and killing animals for food, you’ll join the millions of people who’ve decided to leave meat off their plates for good… Modern meat production is responsible for recent outbreaks of Mad Cow Disease, SARS, Bird Flu, and other diseases, and animal products are also often contaminated with a bacterial stew… The consumption of animal flesh, all of which is riddled with fat and chloresterol, is also a prime contributor to today’s epidemics of obesity, heart disease, and cancer… If we care about the environment, cutting meat out of our diet is the most important action we can take. It is only prejudice that allows anyone to think there is a difference between abusing a cat and abusing a chicken, or abusing a dog and abusing a pig. Suffering is suffering no matter how you slice it. Eating meat is bad for our health, it is bad for the environment, and it directly supports appalling cruelty to animals.”
01	Should E-Verify, the Federal Government's Electronic Employment Verification System, Be Mandatory for All Employers?	"""Over the years, as more and more states have taken it upon themselves to pass their own versions of mandatory E-verify laws, it has become increasingly obvious to our members that a single, federal requirement is the best way to address the issue to avoid confusion, and resultant compliance failures. Using E-Verify, provided it is fair, efficient, and workable, would greatly enhance employers' ability to determine who is work-authorized in the United States, thus making federal immigration law much more viable and effective..."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“I am calling on the federal government to mandate vaccinations for all children, and to eliminate all of the silly loopholes that are creating chaos in so many communities throughout America. Vaccinations are not only about the individual, but they are also meant to protect the lives of others. As we have seen over the past several weeks, measles, and other communicable diseases that were all but eradicated decades ago, are popping up across the country, and putting people’s lives in danger. Basic childhood vaccines should be the legal requirement of every citizen in this country, except in the case of medical contraindications. However, those exclusions should only be granted by a physician or health care provider. It is not for the parent, or consumer advocate to offer an opinion that prevents a child from receiving a vaccination. All these opinions serve to do is confuse the caregiver and possibly even misinform them, which could have fatal implications for the child.”
01	Is Prostitution a Victimless Crime?	"""For too long, many in the United States have considered sex work to be demeaning toward women. Women sex workers are typically viewed as 'billiard balls' helplessly propelled into prostitution and being degraded by their male customers. These hapless victims are viewed with pity while the evil male oppressor is castigated for stooping to the depths of depravity by paying for sex with cash. This is a fallacious and wildly inaccurate allegation. Quite the contrary, after legalization and normalization of private prostitution, more women will feel empowered to perceive their activities not as degrading or demeaning but, rather, as uplifting and beneficial."""

01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“The more I got educated about cruelty and inhumane treatment, then it was really a no brainer [to become a vegetarian]. You know, no one would barbeque their family dog. You know, why is a cow or a pig different, or a chicken different.

10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Thanks to a relentless campaign by the gun lobby, state concealed carry laws (commonly known as ‘CCW’ laws) aren’t just bad; they’re getting worse… Americans want solutions to our nation’s gun violence epidemic – which kills more than 30,000 and injuries almost 70,000 each year – and understand that widespread carrying of concealed weapons isn’t the answer; it’s part of the problem… Most existing CCW permitting schemes are full of dangerous gaps, allowing too many people to carry weapons in too many public places. Contrary to the claims of the gun lobby, research shows that permissive CCW laws do not decrease crime. In fact, these laws may increase crime.”

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The concept that 'mom's job' is having sex with strangers sets the wrong tone for family life. It hurts the woman, it hurts the children; that is an exploitative situation. If prostitution is legal it affords men the 'excuse' to go find sex outside of marriage, when things in the marriage are difficult. That does nothing to enhance the relationship between a man and a woman.   {Prostitution] runs opposite to what relationships are supposed to be. Intimacy and love are not involved; it's just a purely physical act. It lowers both people to the lowest common denominator."""

10	Are Living Wills a Good Idea?	"""Yes, folks. A living will is a bad idea. But what is a living will? Many clients and prospective clients call my office to ask about or to hire me to draft a 'living will.' I think that this is a term many latch onto and assume this is what you want. Not quite the story. A living will is technically a merger of a Will (or commonly known as Last Will and Testament) and a Power of Attorney for Health Care. An ordinary will is just that: Ordinary. It sets up the stage for your last wishes such as who the executor is, what is left to whom, and what to do if someone in your Will predeceases you…  With a Living Will, since it has health care provisions, you have to ... wait for it ... share it with doctors, nurses, hospitals, specialists, staff, etc. Actually, you don't know who will see it or have access to it. Think about that for a second. You are giving copies of your Will to strangers. Why would you do that? Who would ever advise you that is a good idea?  Okay, if you have a Will and a Power of Attorney as separate documents, you only have to share the POA while keeping your Will completely secret and your privacy secured. You cannot do that with a Living Will. Privacy is just one issue to consider, but it is enough that I refuse to draft these things for anyone who might call or email me."""
01	Does Marijuana Cause Depression or Other Mood Disorders?	[cannabis] use in young women was associated with an over fivefold increase in the odds of reporting a state of depression and anxiety after adjustment… Weekly or more frequent cannabis use in teenagers predicted an approximately twofold increase in risk for later depression and anxiety… The prevalence of depression and anxiety increased with higher extents of cannabis use, but this pattern was clearest in female participants.”
10	Should Felons Automatically Regain the Vote after Their Full Sentence (Including Probation/Parole) Is Served?	"""When an individual commits a felony, it is fair they earn their rights back by paying restitution to their victim, court costs, and fines... Iowa has a good and fair policy on the restoration of rights for convicted felons, and to automatically restore the right to vote without requiring the completion of the responsibilities associated with the criminal conviction would damage the balance between the rights and responsibility of citizens...   Too often victims are forgotten and it is important victims of felonies and serious crimes receive their restitution... The updated process for restoration of voting rights streamlines the process for applicants while ensuring we are mindful of the victims of the crime."""
10	Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?	"""If we succeeded in removing the hyperbole and stereotypes from the immigration debate, our politics might open itself to a balanced approach to the problem: legalization for as many undocumented immigrants as possible, but citizenship for none of them. Under this proposal, illegal immigrants who so desired could become ""permanent non-citizen residents"" with no option of ever naturalizing.   Such a policy would do much to address the predicament faced by the undocumented while at the same time respecting and addressing the concerns of those Americans who have long demanded that illegals be penalized for breaking the law."""
10	Do Voters Who Use Electronic Voting Machines Find Them Easy to Use?	"""[Electronic voting] systems offer the promise of faster and more accurate voting, but the current reality is that they are fraught with usability and systemic problems...  When asked to report their overall impressions about using the system (rated between difficult and easy-to-use), 80 percent of the respondents reported the system was easy to use (rated 8 or 9), 10 percent reported it was moderately easy to use (rated 7), and the remaining 10 percent indicated it was anywhere from difficult to somewhat challenging to use (rated from 1 to 6)...  These systems have promise, but the bottom line is that about 10% of the voters we talked to had significant concerns. While 90% satisfaction may be acceptable for some usability studies, we feel strongly that digital government initiatives in general, and voting systems in particular must have higher standards. With important national elections being decided by less than 1% of the voters, leaving 10% unconfident about their vote is a major problem."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""The studies reviewed in this report indicate that alternatives cannot provide significant amounts of liquid fuels. Thus it is not feasible to ramp up alternatives to replace oil, even if there are decades to prepare for the occurrence of Peak Oil. There are no significant mitigation options on the supply side regarding the Peak Oil crisis...  Solar power, nuclear energy, and coal are primarily useful for generating electric power, but these energies do not provide liquid fuels needed for transportation or mechanized agriculture, nor do they provide raw materials for manufacturing of 300,000 products, including fertilizer. Electric power from solar, coal, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion will therefore not solve the nation's energy problems...  Because leaders lack a basic understanding of energy sources, the nation will continue to direct attention toward the hydrogen economy, corn ethanol, wind power, and solar energy – even though the most authoritative sources conclude that these are not solutions for the liquid fuels problems facing the nation."""
01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""It will take at least three decades to completely leave behind fossil fuels. But we can do it...   But the transition will entail costs—not just money and regulation, but also changes in our behavior and expectations. It will probably take at least three or four decades, and will fundamentally change the way we live...  Nearly everyone agrees that the easiest way to kick-start the transition would be to replace coal with solar and wind power for electricity generation...  The collective weight of these challenges and opportunities suggests that a truly all-renewable economy may be very different from the American economy we know today. The renewable economy will likely be slower and more local; it will probably be a conserver economy rather than a consumer economy. It will also likely feature far less economic inequality."""
10	Are Felons on Probation or Parole Considered to Be Still Serving Their Term of Imprisonment?	"""First, it is simply not true that a parolee's status, vis-a-vis either the State or the Constitution, is tantamount to that of a prisoner or even materially distinct from that of a probationer...   In any event, the notion that a parolee legitimately expects only so much privacy as a prisoner is utterly without foundation."""
01	Should Healthcare Resources Be Subject to Rationing?	"""We need to reject the view that we have a moral obligation to spend any amount of money to save all lives and life-years that medical technology permits. The result of adopting this view would be a gross distortion in our society's health care priorities that would not be just, compassionate, or prudent...   Literally dozens of extraordinarily expensive cancer drugs and medical devices are now entering the market. All of them are 'effective'-they prolong life. But the added time is often measurable in weeks and months, not years, which yields very high cost-effectiveness ratios-literally hundreds of thousands of dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Aggregate costs for all these treatments can quickly mount into the tens of billions of dollars. This has two morally problematic systemic consequences: employers drop or drastically restrict health insurance, and health priorities get skewed in ways that are both unjust and uncaring.   As the cost of health insurance to employers mounts by double digits, more drop coverage as an employment benefit or increase copay requirements substantially. In either case, the economically disadvantaged have less access to needed health care than those who remain well insured and well paid...   I have argued elsewhere that the need for health care rationing is inescapable."""
01	Is Drinking Non-Homogenized Milk Healthier Than Drinking Homogenized Milk?	"""Homogenisation of milk may make coronary heart disease more common and more serious. Fat globules in cows' milk are surrounded by membranes. Some people make antibodies to these membranes. The antibodies cause human platelets to clump together, at least in the laboratory. It is thought that this occurs in real life, encouraging clotting in patients who have the antibodies. The antibodies also bind to natural killer cells, one of whose functions is to reduce inflammation. When the antibodies are bound to them, the action of these cells is suppressed, increasing inflammation. We know that inflammation plays a part in coronary heart disease. Homogenisation breaks up milk fat globules, increasing the surface area of the membrane, which is likely to increase the antibody response. Xanthine oxidase has been suggested as the part of the milk fat globule membrane that causes the formation of antibodies, but other components may be involved."""
10	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""The tantalising term 'hydrogen economy' becomes meaningful only when the energy system is based around hydrogen derived from sustainable renewable resources, such as wind, solar, or geothermal power. Producing hydrogen from fossil fuels, by definition, perpetuates the 'fossil fuel economy' in which we find ourselves today. In this respect, hydrogen is really no different from electricity: there are clean sources, and there are dirty sources...  [T]he short- to medium-term outlook for commercial hydrogen production revolves around natural gas reforming and coal gasification. Thus we find ourselves standing once again at the doorstep of Big Oil, where we begin to understand the broader strategic context in which BP and Shell recently announced their respective joint-ventures with giant coal companies Rio Tinto and Anglo-American...  [T]he production of hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water can be relatively efficient; literature surveys reveal a wide range of values from as low as forty percent to over eighty percent. Though most analysts use fifty percent as a working assumption, even if we are optimistic and project electrolyser efficiencies at the upper end of the range, unless we have at our disposal a surplus of sustainable renewable electricity, can we ever justify throwing some of it away in order to produce hydrogen? Perhaps we can, but only in very specific circumstances such as off-grid renewable electricity generation with no access to energy storage facilities.  From the outset, therefore, in the competition between potential carriers of sustainable renewable energy, hydrogen lags behind electrons in terms of existing generating capacity and energy efficiency...  Assuming future generations – in a more populous world, barring unprecedented natural disasters or armed conflicts – will be keen to use their energy resources wisely, we can only imagine how they would judge their forebears for blindly pursuing the inefficient hydrogen economy...  Electricity will always hold the potential to be a more efficient carrier of energy than hydrogen molecules, on a life-cycle basis."""
10	Should the US Increase Its Use of Natural Gas?	"""[N]atural gas is a finite fossil fuel and cannot be relied upon as a long-term, low-cost source of energy or as a solution to global warming. While generating electricity with efficient natural gas combined cycle units produces 60 percent less carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour than conventional coal-fired power plants, even these emission levels are too high in relation to America's need to reduce emissions 80 percent or more by mid-century in order to prevent dangerous global warming...  A National Renewable Electricity Standard requiring utilities to increase sales of power from renewable sources can significantly reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation without relying on increased use of natural gas."""

"""Synthetic hormones such as recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) are commonly used in dairy cows to increase the production of milk.

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""People who have had luckier lives, as well as those who profit from the sex industry in some way, frequently refer to prostitution and pornography as 'victim-less crimes'. They point to a tiny fraction of sex workers who actually might be involved by choice. They selectively read history to find some tiny minority, somewhere, at some time, who gained something in the sex business.  The very selectiveness of their attention indicates that, on some level, they know that for almost everyone, involvement in the sex industry is a terrible misfortune.   As many an old cop will say, 'Anyone who thinks prostitution is a victimless crime, hasn’t seen it up close.'"""
01	Would Legal Prostitution Decrease Sexually Transmitted Diseases?	"""It is argued that legalising or decriminalising sex work is beneficial to curbing the HIV epidemic because it allows governments to monitor and regulate the sex trade. In doing so, they can ensure that sex workers are empowered to negotiate condom use, improve their access to public services, and protect them from violence and abuse. Where sex workers are criminalised, they can be difficult to reach or unwilling to cooperate for fear of being arrested. By removing legal restrictions, HIV prevention programmes could be carried out much more effectively.  Research evidence supports this argument. An analysis of data from 27 European countries found that in countries that have legalised some aspects of sex work there is a significantly lower HIV prevalence among sex workers compared to those countries where all aspects of sex work are criminalised."""

Yes, I could probably ascend the four mile climb into Fahnestock Park near my home more easily if I used EPO. I could do it much more quickly on a motorbike. But where is the satisfaction in that?  Humankind could devise a transhumanist competition for cyber-athletes if it wished. I would not be at all surprised.

This is not a computer-programming problem. It is a procedural matter, and part of the procedure must involve keeping human beings, as many of us as possible, in control of our own voting system. Any computerized voting system that requires us to trust a few computer scientists and some corporate executives constitutes flawed public policy.

During the alleged congressional debate on the Ashcroft-Bush USA Patriot Act, the ACLU’s Washington staff, directed by Laura Murphy, worked 14-hour days to research the constitutional damage contained in each significant detail of that mephitic bill. Alas, hardly any member of Congress appears to have read the subsequent press releases, but some journalists have. When the Ashcroft dragnet imprisoned over 1000 immigrants in hopes of finding links to terrorism, Romero [Executive Director of the ACLU] decided to ‘paint a human face’ on these people held in secret, transferred from prison to prison to keep their lawyers and families from finding them, and otherwise stripped of elementary due-process rights.”

The statistics tell the story that we know all too well. Since Obamacare's central rules took effect, premiums for individual market plans have doubled. At the same time, insurance coverage rates have fallen far short of predictions. The Congressional Budget Office had projected that 23 million Americans would be enrolled in the law's healthcare exchanges this year; the reality is that the number of Americans currently enrolled is less than half that estimate.  Patients increasingly don't have a choice of insurers, either. In one-third of all counties in America, there is only one insurance company participating on the exchanges; in another 37 percent of counties, there are just two. The situation is especially acute in rural areas, where prices are high and access to care is already a struggle."""

When the issue reached the Supreme Court, three ACLU affiliates (including the Florida affiliate, where I was executive director), were so appalled by the national organization’s stance that we filed a brief opposing it… The Supreme Court agreed the floating buffer zone violated free speech and struck it down… The clash of interests at abortion clinics is between the First Amendment rights of protesters and the government’s interest in protecting the public’s health and safety. Throughout its history, the ACLU has routinely come out on the First Amendment side of that equation. Until now, that is.”
01	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""The problem is that medical science has conquered the gentle and peaceful deaths and left the humiliating and agonizing to run their relentless downhill course. The suffering of these individuals is not trivial and it is not addressed by anything medical science has to offer. Faced with this dilemma, the problem for many is that the law turns loving families into criminals. It separates loved ones at the end, when it is most important to be close. It encourages patients to choose violent and premature deaths while they still have the strength to act. And it forces some to suffer through a slow and agonizing death that contradicts the very meaning and fabric of their lives...

10	Is Obamacare Leading to a Decline in Employment-Based Health Insurance? - DEBATED	"""There's real concern that companies will see the Affordable Care Act as an opportunity to drop health insurance for their employees and let taxpayers pick up the tab.

But people simply misunderstand why employers offer health-care benefits. They're not doing it as a favor to employees. And they're not doing it because anyone is making them... Employers offer health insurance because employees demand it. If you're an employer who doesn't offer insurance and your competitors do, you'll lose out on the most talented workers. An employer who stopped offering health benefits would see his best employees immediately start looking for other jobs...  There are a couple other reasons to expect that employers won't be eager to drop coverage. First, because employer-provided health benefits are not taxed, employers can pay their workers more by paying them partly in health-care benefits. Let's say an employer decides to stop offering health benefits but, in a bid to keep employees happy, promises to give them the cash value of their coverage. The employer would have to spend more on the wages than it spends on the benefits, as the wages are taxed... Second, the fraction of employers actually affected by the health law's mandate is very small.   Which is all to say that, for most companies, the Affordable Care Act won't bring much change at all, and so there's little reason to expect their behavior will change, either. And if it does change, it might not change in the direction we expect."""

01	Is Sexual Orientation Determined at Birth?	of the main reasons discrimination persists is that many people in America… advance and reinforce the myth that being gay is a choice. For them, it is as if we silly LGBT people would be perfectly happy and healthy if we would just make a different set of decisions about our lives. As a young boy growing up in Austin, Minnesota, teachers forced pens into my right hand in the futile hope of correcting my left-handedness. If they had known I was gay, they might have tried to fix that, too. They would have failed. I spent the first 35 years of my life trying very hard not to be gay, to the extent that I married my college sweetheart and created a beautiful family of five children with her. Hard as I tried to make that life work, I could not escape my attraction to men. Choice had nothing to do with it… Until the time that people accept that all of us are born into our sexual orientation and identity, LGBT citizens will still endure discrimination and selective application of the Constitution’s protections.”

10	Is Wind Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""While the price of wind power has indeed fallen, it still costs more than spot market electric power (3.5 to 4 cents kwh). Furthermore, the price gap between wind and conventional power production is actually greater, since the federal government subsidizes wind power through a production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kwh...  Because wind is an intermittent resource, wind farms must rely on conventional power plants to back up their supply. Wind farms generate power only when the wind is blowing within a certain range of speed. When there is too little wind, the towers don't generate power; but when the wind is too strong, they must be shut down for fear of being blown down. And even when they function properly, wind farms' average output is less than 30 percent of their theoretical capacity."""

01	Does the Fraternal Birth Order Effect Demonstrate a Biological Basis to Sexual Orientation?	number of biological older brothers, including those not reared with the participant (but not the number of nonbiological older brothers), increases the probability of homosexuality in men. These results provide evidence that a prenatal mechanism(s), and not social and/or rearing factors, affects men’s sexual orientation development… If rearing or social factors associated with older male siblings underlies the fraternal birth-order effect, then the number of nonbiological older brothers should predict men’s sexual orientation, but they do not… If rearing or social factors underlie the fraternal birth-order effect, the number of biological older brothers with who they were not reared should not predict men’s sexual orientation because they should have no impact on the sociosexual environment of their younger brothers. Yet, these brothers do predict men’s sexual orientation just as the number of biological older brothers with whom they were reared. These results support a prenatal [before birth] origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal ‘memory’ for male gestations or births.”
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""The death penalty is a necessary and appropriate punishment. Many people treat 'retribution' as an unworthy purpose for such a harsh punishment. But criminal punishments are retribution for crimes. One cannot reject capital punishment because it is retribution; the issue is whether it is an appropriate form of retribution.  Everyone agrees that there should be some punishment for murder. This mandate turns capital punishment into a necessity when nothing else serves as real punishment for a murder... Everyone would also agree that besides imposing some punishment for murder, the law should also impose meaningful punishment...   Putting a monetary price on innocent life would not be a meaningful penalty for murder. We do not impose fines on murderers because it would seriously deprecate the value of human life... After a murderer has killed a certain number of victims, he reaches a point where the only meaningful retribution is the death penalty. There are murders for which alternative sentences of imprisonment are demonstrably meaningless...  Treating capital punishment as though it is 'eye for an eye,' 'blood for blood' or 'murder for murder' ignores the differences between public retribution and private revenge. Criminal punishment inherently imposes sanctions that private individuals are unable to impose on each other."""
01	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""The early framers of the Constitution wrote it as a secular document not because they were hostile to religion--neutrality is not hostility--but because they did not want to imply that the new federal government would have any authority to meddle in religious matters.  The framers wanted the First Amendment to ban not only the establishment of a single church but also 'multiple establishments,' that is, a system by which the government might prefer or fund many religions on an equal basis.  Both the House of Representatives and Senate rejected several versions of the First Amendment that would have permitted non-preferential support for all religion. The founders intentionally barred all religious establishments. They left no room for a kind of 'non-preferentialism' in which government can aid religion if it helps all religions equally...  By the time the Constitution was fully drafted, many of its framers had come to believe strongly in 'disestablishment.' Thomas Jefferson, for example, wrote in 1802 that phrase we have come to know so well, writing of 'a wall of separation between church and state.'  In 1785, James Madison wrote that 'religion is not helped by establishment, but is hurt by it.' In 1791, the viewpoints of Madison and Jefferson were reflected in the Bill of Rights."""

Performance-enhancing drugs may not be desirable, but they are here to stay. What we can do away with is the hypocrisy.  Insiders know that many - perhaps most - top players in all sports take drugs to train harder and feel no pain during play. The trainers, sports doctors, nutritionists, physiotherapists and managers of the big names make sure banned substances are taken at the safest and most efficient levels, and when they can, the governing bodies look the other way...  The main effect of banning such substances has been to turn performers and their coaches into liars and cheats. We should legalise performance-enhancing drugs so that they can be regulated and athletes on the way up - whose entourages do not yet include savvy physiotherapists and doctors - don't overdose and do themselves damage."""
10	Should Prostitution Tolerance Zones like Red-Light Districts Be Created?

Countries that have gone down this route, such as the Netherlands, Denmark or Germany, have seen a vast increase in prostitution — and worse still, child prostitution — which has helped fuel the stupendous rise in global people trafficking.  It is also hard to see how this policy would prevent such murders from occurring. Even Glasgow's 'tolerance zone' did not prevent a murder from taking place there... No amount of regulation can protect against that. The danger to prostitutes comes essentially not from where they ply their trade but from the trade itself. Prostitution embodies a view of women which is intrinsically brutalising, dehumanising and predatory. That is why the violence to which it gives rise is routine. That is why it is so appalling that anyone should be arguing that it should be regularised and thus condoned."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Correlations are just relationships between two variables; you can never say one causes the other. We could say that during the season when ice cream sales increase, shark attacks also increase. But we could not say the more ice cream you sell, the more you cause shark attacks. Why would a couple of child psychologists come to the defense of violent video games? Because some legislative initiatives and public opinions across the country are based on fallacious assumptions, personal biases, political posturing and weak science. One recent systematic analysis of the research literature found ‘insufficient, contradictory and methodologically flawed evidence on the association between television viewing and video game playing and aggression in children and young people with behavioral and emotional difficulties. If public health advice is to be evidence-based, good quality research is needed,’ (Mitrofan, Paul, Spencer, 2009). Another extensive study found ‘no support for the hypothesis that violent video game playing is associated with higher aggression,’ (Ferguson, 2007). In fact, that same study found some positive benefits of playing violent video games, particularly improvements in visual-spatial thinking. While there are studies that find people who play violent video games may have a brief increase in violent thoughts and feelings, newer research finds that these thoughts and feelings typically last less than four minutes (Barlett, Branch, Rodeheffer, & Harris, 2009). And remember, having a violent thought is a whole lot different than actually committing violence.”

During the protest, actor Daryl Hannah, climate scientist James Hansen, and author and activist Bill McKibben were among some 1,200 people who were arrested...   For many years, the US has relied most heavily on crude imports from Mexico and Canada. Over the past ten years, Canadian crude production has risen by 600,000 barrels per day while Mexico's has fallen by about that same amount. I'd rather have a reliable, long-term supply of crude from Canada than rely on overseas suppliers, whether they are part of OPEC or not. How long can we rely on the Canadian oil sands? Probably for decades. The resources there are estimated at over 100 billion barrels...   Like it or not, oil is here to stay. US oil consumption — as a percentage of its total primary energy consumption — now stands at about 37 percent. That's the exact same percentage as in 1949... the hard fact is that petroleum is a miraculous substance. Nothing else comes close to oil when it comes to energy density, ease of handling, flexibility, convenience, cost, or scale...   Demonize oil all you want, but coal is the real issue when it comes to carbon-dioxide emissions. Again, look at the numbers: Over the past decade, global coal use increased by 47 percent to about 71.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. During that same time period, oil use increased by 13 percent to about 87.3 million barrels per day. If Hansen, McKibben, and their allies want to protest projects that result in lots of carbon-dioxide emissions, they should be looking for coal mines and coal-fired generators, not oil pipelines."""

01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Parents do know that children learn by observing, imitating what they observe, and acting on the world around them. According to child psychologist Michael Rich, children develop what psychologists call ‘behavioral scripts.’ They interpret their experiences and respond to others using those scripts. One can easily see how repeated exposure to violent behavioral scripts can lead to increased feelings of hostility, expectation that others will behave aggressively, desensitization to the pain of others, and an increased likelihood of interacting and responding to others with violence. Violent video games are an ideal environment in which to learn violence. Violent video games: * Place the player in the role of the aggressor and reward him or her for violent behavior. * Allow the player to rehearse an entire behavioral script from provocation to choosing a violent resolution of conflict.* Are addictive – kids want to play them for hours to improve their playing skills, and repetition increases learning.”
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“It’s easier to blame the games because the games seem like something we could regulate, we could curtail, we could take away. Whereas if we start talking about violence in the family, or bullying at schools, or things that involve human factors that gets much more complicated. We have this conversation with a lot of different types of media at a lot of different points in history… I’m sure there will be some point in the future where people say ‘oh this person played video games’ and everyone will say ‘so what?’ That’s clearly not it. Reading Superman didn’t do it, playing ‘Call of Duty’ probably wasn’t the only thing going on here either. One of my favorite studies is… on what in games made people the most aggressive or made them the most violent. There are two things. One is, when people play games they’re not good at, when the game is too hard for them, people get very agitated and very upset. The other is when the technology fails. So if you’re playing a game and your X-box crashes or your PC crashes you’re very likely to get very angry and very upset. Those are the two things that have the most direct effect on how people respond to games and neither of those has to do with the tone or content of the game.”

10	Is There a Legal Right to Die?	"""The fact that the refusal of treatment and suicide may both lead to death does not mean that they implicate identical constitutional concerns. The imposition of life-sustaining medical treatment against a patient's will requires a direct invasion of bodily integrity and, in some cases, the use of physical restraints, both of which are flatly inconsistent with society's basic conception of personal dignity... It is this right against intrusion--not a general right to control the timing and manner of death--that forms the basis of the constitutional right to refuse life-sustaining treatment. Restrictions on suicide, by contrast, entail no such intrusions, but simply prevent individuals from intervening in the natural process of dying.  While restrictions on suicide do limit individual autonomy, the bare fact that individual options are constrained does not render such limits unconstitutional... Indeed, in recent years the Supreme Court has afforded constitutional protection only to those individual practices 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.' While the merits of this constitutional doctrine are subject to debate, its effect on the constitutional distinction between the refusal of treatment and suicide is clear. On the one hand, the right to refuse treatment has a well-established history in the laws of informed consent and battery. On the other hand, individuals have never been granted a right to control the timing and manner of their death; indeed, suicide was illegal in many states for most of this nation's history, and, even after decriminalization, society continues to discourage suicide and seek to prevent individuals from taking their own lives. The historical opposition to suicide, while neither necessary nor sufficient to the Task Force's own constitutional analysis, makes it virtually inconceivable that the United States Supreme Court would recognize a constitutional right to commit suicide."""

Iran is the largest state-sponsor of global terrorism.   The other two resolutions were given to North Korea and Burma, both dictatorships with consistent systematic human rights violations. Yet Israel, the only country in the Middle East that has true democracy, free speech, religious tolerance, gay rights and equal protection for all citizens of the State, was handed 22 resolutions.   Israel has surely made mistakes, as all governments and nations have. However, the crimes that Israel has committed are consistently magnified to unfair levels, while those of other nations receive no attention.

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“[L]ongings – for compassion, for sustainability, for an equitable distribution of resources – are not served by the philosophy or practice of vegetarianism… The vegetarian Pied Pipers have the best of intentions. I’ll state right now what I’ll be repeating later: everything they say about factory farming is true. It is cruel, wasteful, and destructive… Certainly, most people who consume factory farmed meat have never asked what died and how it died. But frankly, neither have most vegetarians. The truth is that agriculture is the most destructive thing humans have done to the planet, and more of the same won’t save us. The truth is that agriculture requires the wholesale destruction of entire ecosystems. The truth is also that life isn’t possible without death, that no matter what you eat, someone has to die to feed you. When the rainforest falls to beef, progressives are outraged, aware, ready to boycott. But our attachment to the vegetarian myth leaves us uneasy, silent, and ultimately immobilized when the culprit is wheat and the victim is the prairie… The vast majority of people in the US don’t grow food, let alone hunt and gather it. We have no way to judge how much death is embodied in a serving of salad, a bowl of fruit, a plate of beef… A vegetarian diet – especially a low-fat version, and most especially a vegan one – is not sufficient nutrition for long-term maintenance and repair of the human body. To put it bluntly, it will damage you. I know. Two years into my veganhood, my health failed, and it failed catastrophically.”
01	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Thanks to this law, more than twenty million Americans have gained the security and peace of mind of health insurance. Thanks to this law, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured – the highest rate in our history. Thanks to this law, the days when women could be charged more than men and Americans with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage altogether are relics of the past. Seniors have bigger discounts on their prescription drugs. Young people can stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26 years old. And Americans who already had insurance received an upgrade as well – from free preventive care, like mammograms and vaccines, to improvements in the quality of care in hospitals that has averted nearly 100,000 deaths so far.  All of that is thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And all the while, since the law passed, the pace of health care inflation has slowed dramatically. Prices are still rising, just as they have every year for decades – but under this law, they’ve been rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a 'death spiral,' because while it's true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable. Likewise, this law is no 'job-killer,' because America's businesses went on a record-breaking streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it.  So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act.”"

Congress should waste no time in passing a federal E-Verify mandate to unburden employers, help ensure a safe work environment, protect jobs for authorized workers, and defend E-Verify from cyber-attack."""
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“[T]he choice of abortion is objectively immoral… [A]s early as eight or ten weeks of gestation, the fetus has a fully formed, beating heart, a complete brain… a recognizably human form… There are three important points we wish to make about this human embryo. First, it is from the start distinct from any cell of the mother or of the father. This is clear because it is growing in its own distinct direction. Its growth is internally directed to its own survival and maturation. Second, the embryo is human: it has the genetic makeup characteristic of human beings. Third, and most importantly, the embryo is a complete or whole organism, though immature. The human embryo, from conception onward, is fully programmed actively to develop himself or herself to the mature stage of a human being, and, unless prevented by disease or violence, will actually do so… So, a human embryo (or fetus) is not something distinct from a human being; he or she is not an individual of any non-human or intermediate species. Rather, an embryo (and fetus) is a human being at a certain (early) stage of development – the embryonic (or fetal) stage. In abortion, what is killed is a human being, a whole living member of the species homo sapiens, the same kind of entity as you or I, only at an earlier stage of development.”

10	Should Congress pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act?	"""Democratic lawmakers apparently want to ban insider trading by members of Congress and their staffs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these groups have so far been exempt from the general prohibition against insider trading. Rather than broadening the ban, however, Congress should repeal it entirely. The ban is problematic on efficiency and equity grounds. The ban is inefficient to the extent it delays release of relevant information, since this means delayed adjustment of stock prices. Markets cannot allocate resources properly unless they know which companies are doing well or badly. The ban is inequitable because some corporate executives trade on inside information despite the law. Thus the ban rewards dishonest insiders."""
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“[T]he scientific case for human-caused climate change is clear. The evidence includes independent assessments of thermometer records documenting the degree and extent of modern warming. It includes the unprecedented melting of glaciers and, as documented in more recent years, the diminution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet. As a consequence of melting ice and warming oceans, the global sea level is rising and at an accelerating rate. Continental drought is becoming more pronounced in many extratropical regions, such as the deserts of the U.S. Southwest, and there is an increase in the destructive potential of Atlantic hurricanes that influence the east and Gulf coasts. Theoretical climate models predict these things to happen, but only when human influences – in particular, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations due to fossil fuel burning—are included. Those same models project far more profound and potentially damaging impacts of climate change if action is not taken to stabilize greenhouse gas levels this next decade… Sadly, some who are opposed to taking action to combat the potential threat have engaged in a smear campaign that appears intended to distract the public and policymakers from the reality of the threat as policymakers begin to consider taking more serious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

If steroid use for professional athletes is permitted, they will be able to legally obtain physical enhancement drugs which have been regulated, and are therefore possibly safe to use...  Now, let's not forget that the purpose of professional sports is entertainment, witnessing the seemingly magical feats of human athleticism and physical ability. An increase in steroid use would only serve to increase the talent and intensity of the game and bring it to a higher level...The essence of sports is that winning touchdown, that sprinting finish, and that fence-clearing homerun.

01	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Social media is a platform for sharing ideas, information and points of view. This can have important educational value: it extends the information young people can access while also giving them insight into how others think about and use that information… For those children who feel marginalised in their local community, social media can help them connect with other people who share the same interests or outlook on life. In some cases, teenagers with critical problems can turn to social networks for fast support and guidance. There are plenty of groups that offer such help online. Social media is also an important platform for driving social issues, such as racial issues, to greater national and international attention.”

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“There is no quantitative evidence that varying levels of minor greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 have accounted for even as much as half of the reconstructed glacial-interglacial temperature changes or, more importantly, for the large variations in global ice volume on both land and sea over the past 650kyr [650,000 years]. This paper shows that changes in solar insolation [amount of solar energy hitting the earth] at climatically sensitive latitudes and zones exceed the global radiative forcings [greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere traping solar heat] of CO2 and CH4 by severalfold… [T]he popular notion of CO2 and CH4 radiative forcing as the predominant amplifier of glacial-interglacial phase transitions cannot be confirmed… Our basic hypothesis is that long-term climate change is driven by insolation changes, from both orbital variations and intrinsic solar magnetic luminosity variations.

10	Is Logic and Accuracy Testing an Effective Method of Assuring That Electronic Voting Machines Are Operating Properly before an Election?	"""Poor logic and accuracy tests have caused numerous elections problems in the past... DREs present two special problems for logic and accuracy tests. Each 'ballot' of a logic and accuracy test for a DRE must be produced by hand, by voting the test ballot on the DRE itself. The problems are: (1) This process is time-consuming on a DRE, so DRE logic and accuracy tests tend to be small. Unfortunately, logic and accuracy tests are often already too small to catch important mistakes... (2) It is difficult to correctly generate a series of test ballots on a DRE without a single error... Consequently, election workers must conduct DRE logic and accuracy tests with extreme deliberation and caution, as even a single error requires that the entire logic and accuracy test be repeated. In practice, this results in logic and accuracy tests that are smaller yet, to the point where the test is testing for little besides a stuck button or a completely nonfunctional DRE... Logic and accuracy tests are simply more difficult to conduct on DREs than on other election systems."""

After this generation's corporate scandals, Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 to improve corporate governance and audit independence. But one of the measures added reporting requirements and tougher standards for insider trading.   Unfortunately, Congress forgot itself. It remains perfectly legal for a member of Congress to buy and sell stocks based on information that's not available to the public. Last year it was reported that a 'political intelligence' firm tipped off its clients to an undelivered speech by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist on asbestos liability.

The environment in which we live, referred to as an obesogenic environment, certainly plays a major permissive role in the expression of the many genes that lead to the accumulation of fat mass. As with any other chronic disease, obesity may be treated, managed, controlled, and even put into remission. But it cannot be cured. Patients need to understand this premise, because the treatment of obesity is life-long. The implementation of models of chronic disease management for the treatment of obesity provides the appropriate framework for success. Thus, obesity treatment should include all available treatment modalities, from lifestyle changes that include better nutrition and more physical activity (NOT diet and exercise), to pharmacotherapy, to the use of devices, and surgery for weight loss.”

As such, its effect in the body appears to be insufficient to produce the genetic damage typically associated with developing cancer… In descriptive data from the large networks of population-based registries funded by NCI, there has been no meaningful increase in the incidence of brain or other nervous system cancers from 1987 through 2005, a time period when cell phone use increased 10-fold.”
01	Are Felon Disenfranchisement Laws a Form of Racial Discrimination?	"""Of the approximately 100,000 parolees and probationers subject to the state's felon-disfranchisement law, more than 60 percent are African American or Latino, which the ACLU and Rutgers say is in large measure a consequence of racial profiling in the criminal justice system. As a result, the political power of the African American and Latino communities in New Jersey is diluted because they are disproportionately excluded from voting...   The organizations are requesting that the Inter-American Commission investigate the claims made in their petition, declare the federal government and New Jersey and other states with similar post-incarceration voting restrictions in violation of universally accepted human rights standards, and most importantly, to urge all U.S. states to bring their felon disfranchisement laws into line with these standards."""
10	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""No other workplace has to cover the range of health and safety issues that ensue from this sexual and economic exchange. Together with STIs [Sexually Transmitted Infections], verbal abuse, battering, sexual harassment and violence, rape and unwanted pregnancies are recognised occupational health and safety risks within the prostitution industry. This does not change because prostitution is legalised."""
10	Are Mass Deportations a Good Method to Address Illegal Immigration?	"""Locating millions of immigrants for deportation would take a very dramatic increase in domestic surveillance and enforcement, including door-to-door roundups. Mistakes would inevitably be made, with legal immigrants and citizens swept up in the process. Courts that handle immigration cases would be overwhelmed.   Mass deportations would also harm the economy. Most undocumented workers are in relatively low-skilled jobs, but about a quarter are in white-collar jobs. Of those, about half are in management, finance or professional careers. Removing large numbers would have a very significant impact on the businesses that employ them. Undocumented workers make up about 5.1% of the American workforce at a time when a 4.9% unemployment rate shows that labor markets are growing tight."""
01	Are There Sufficient Procedures in Place to Guard against Physical Tampering with Electronic Voting Machines?

The supervisor of elections shall create and maintain a secured location for storing and transporting voting devices once the election parameters are loaded. This shall include procedures that are to be used at locations outside the direct control of the supervisor of elections, such as overnight storage at a polling location...  The chain of custody must utilize two or more individuals to perform a check and verification check whenever a transfer of custody takes place or where the voting devices have been left unattended for any length of time.

10	Is Prostitution Psychologically Harmful to Prostitutes?	"""Certainly streetwalkers are not paragons of mental health, but it is doubtful that prostitution made them that way. And what of the higher-end prostitutes? And some women may be drawn to the profession due to past sexual abuse or somesuch, but even if they are thereby damaged further, prostitution cannot really be blamed for the negative outcome. And some women might simply be dispositionally unsuited for the profession, such that they would be damaged if they entered it. But none of these facts shows that the profession is itself psychologically harmful. It might be positively beneficial for some women in some circumstances -- or at least no more psychologically harmful (and much more lucrative) than alternative professions."""

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In Sweden, prostitution is officially acknowledged as a form of male sexual violence against women and children. One of the cornerstones of Swedish policies against prostitution and trafficking in human beings is the focus on the root cause, the recognition that without men's demand for and use of women and girls for sexual exploitation, the global prostitution industry would not be able flourish and expand.   Prostitution is a serious problem that is harmful, in particular, not only to the prostituted woman or child but also to society at large. Therefore, prostituted women and children are seen as victims of male violence who do not risk legal penalties. Instead, they have a right to assistance to escape prostitution."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Playing violent video games does not cause kids to commit mass shootings. Over 150 million Americans (and 71% of teens) play video games.

Of the 41 attackers studied, 27% had an interest in violent movies, 24% in violent books, and 37% exhibited interest in their own violent writings, while only 12% showed interest in violent video games.

10	Did Electronic Voting Machines in the 2000 and 2004 Elections Give an Advantage to a Particular Political Party or a Candidate from a Particular Party?	"""Over the past week we've seen several media stories suggesting that the electronic voting machine issue is partisan. While there are certainly folks who would like to portray it that way, including Jeb Bush and unfortunately last week, The Washington Post, it's not true. Far more importantly, it's not true in terms of who should care.  In a recent court case, EFF presented evidence of 18 serious direct recording electronic (DRE) problems over the past two years, and in the majority of the cases that we've seen, electronic voting systems don't fail in any partisan way - they just fail. And given the many ways that they can be cracked, no political party has a 'lock' on programmers who could sway an election."""
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“[T]he nature of drone warfare itself has become central. The operators’ very remoteness, it is claimed, leads to desensitisation. But throughout the history of weapons, designers have always sought to maximise lethality while reducing the vulnerability of those using the weapons. And while it has long been accepted that there is a relationship between increased distance from a target and the ability to kill with reduced feelings of guilt, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some drone operators, because they spend so long intimately observing their targets, experience the same emotional damage as those who kill at close quarters… The use of force against countries in peacetime… is governed by Article 51 of the UN Charter. This permits ‘the right of individual or collective defence’ across borders in peacetime if either one of two requirements is satisfied: that the group or individuals being targeted poses a threat or if the country, where the strike takes place, ‘consents’. While Pakistan has complained that drone strikes ‘infringe its sovereignty’, strong evidence exists that suggests it is heavily involved in providing the intelligence and other participation for strikes. A case can be made too that drones might be ‘more ethical’ than other older systems because they can be more discriminate, lingering over their target for hours or returning for days to the location, giving those authorising the operations the opportunity to minimise noncombatant casualties.”
10	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""Our survey indicates that the vast majority of the world’s top criminologists believe that the empirical research has revealed the deterrence hypothesis for a myth... 88.2% of polled criminologists do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent... 9.2% answered that the statement '[t]he death penalty significantly reduces the number of homicides' was accurate... Overall, it is clear that however measured, fewer than 10% of the polled experts believe the deterrence effect of the death penalty is stronger than that of long-term imprisonment... Recent econometric studies, which posit that the death penalty has a marginal deterrent effect beyond that of long-term imprisonment, are so limited or flawed that they have failed to undermine consensus.   In short, the consensus among criminologists is that the death penalty does not add any significant deterrent effect above that of long-term imprisonment."""

At the same time the Palestinians should stop terrorist activities and convince the Israelis that they accept Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. They should declare their withdrawal from the right of return and accept the solution of resettlement, compensation and rehabilitation as specified in the UN decision 194 section iii.

One month after Jones sent the letters, the Republican became a paid consultant for Sequoia Voting Systems, a touch-screen manufacturer that was bidding for Santa Clara County's $19 million contract and ultimately won it.  Critics say Jones' move illustrates a troubling reality of elections in the electronic age: close, often invisible, bonds link election officials to the equipment companies they are supposed to regulate...

10	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“U.S. law lets American citizens travel to any country on earth, friend or foe — with one exception: Cuba. It’s time for us to scrap this anachronistic ban… This ban has prevented contact between Cubans and ordinary Americans, who serve as ambassadors for the democratic values we hold dear. Such contact would help break Havana’s chokehold on information about the outside world. And it would contribute to improving the image of the United States, particularly in Latin America, where the U.S. embargo on Cuba remains a centerpiece of anti-Washington grievances… Finally, while travel restrictions are contrary to our foreign policy interests, they also impede the right of Americans to freedom of speech, association and to travel. Sometimes a travel ban may be necessary, but nothing about the Cuba situation today justifies such an infringement on our basic liberties.” [Editor’s Note: The statement above refers only to the travel ban aspect of the Cuba embargo.]

Hundreds of thousands of Americans will soon receive cancellation letters affecting their 2015 health care plans — and that number may quickly rise into the millions. This wave of cancellations will fall into two categories. The first group hit will be in the individual market, the same group that suffered through at least 6.3 million cancellation letters last year. They will almost certainly be joined by millions of people in the small-employer market, which has 40 million plans and will be under Obamacare's control starting next year.

10	Have Health Insurance Premiums Been Rising at a Faster Rate Under Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""[M]ost people will pay more for health insurance next year. That's true whether you get coverage from a job, on your own through an exchange or directly from an insurer, or from Medicare. Health insurance prices tend to go up. It's their nature, and it's closely tied to how much the cost of medical care rises.  The good news is that available information indicates the doomsayers were wrong, and premiums under President Barack Obama's health care law aren't going through the roof.  The average increase for Obamacare plans will be 8.2 percent next year in 29 states and the District of Columbia where data about health insurance premiums for 2015 are available, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has conducted the most thorough review to date ['A Preliminary Look at 2015 Individual Market Rate Filings'].

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""I believe it is appropriate to say that the House Bill 1094 [to abolish the death penalty]gives Colorado an opportunity to extricate itself from what many states are increasingly finding to be an ineffective and expensive burden. The clear national trend is away from a broad use of the death penalty, as indicated by a 60% drop in death sentences, a 45% decline in executions, a smaller death row, and a decreasing level of public support. In public opinion polls, there is a clear upward trend in support for life-without-parole sentences as a substitute for the death penalty... Moreover, the states without the death penalty have fared better in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty. The death penalty concentrates millions of dollars on a few people with almost no control over the outcome. (This does not even take into account the less tangible costs such as the risk of executing the innocent, or the divisiveness caused by the perceptions of racial unfairness.)

People on both sides of the euthanasia and assisted suicide controversies claim membership in religious denominations. There are also individuals on both sides who claim no religious affiliation at all. But it’s even more important to realize that these are not religious issues, nor should this be a religious debate.  The debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide is about public policy and the law...

"""I do not condone or encourage the use of any particular drugs, medicine, or illegal substances in any aspect of life...  The pressure associated with winning games, pleasing fans, and getting the big contract, led me, and others, to engage in behavior that would produce immediate results.

10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would decrease employee benefits and increase tax payments. According to James Sherk, MA, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a single mother working full time and earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would be over $260 a month worse off if the minimum wage were raised to $10.10: ""While her market income rises by $494, she loses $71 in EITC [earned income tax credit] refunds, pays $37 more in payroll taxes and $45 more in state income taxes. She also loses $88 in food stamp benefits and $528 in child-care subsidies."" [77] A 2014 study of 400 US Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) by Campbell Harvey, PhD, J. Paul Sticht Professor of International Business at Duke University, found that 40% of CFOs would reduce employee benefits if the minimum wage were raised to $10 an hour. [78] Some staff at the Seattle-area nonprofit organization, Full Life Care, asked for a reduction in hours after the minimum wage was raised, citing concerns that the increase will mean they lose their housing subsidies yet they are still unable to afford market-rate rents.

01	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Our personal protection is ultimately up to us. That’s why I’m a gun owner, that’s why I have a concealed carry permit, and that’s why tens of millions of Americans have concealed carry permits as well. It’s just common sense… The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving – which is a privilege, not a right – then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.”
10	Do Voters Have Confidence That Electronic Voting Machines Record Votes Accurately?	"""When asked to report whether they trusted that the system recorded the votes they intended to cast... individuals who use computers frequently reported having less trust in the new voting systems than did others.

10	Is Solar Power Production Environmentally Friendly?	"""[W]hile generating electricity through photovoltaics is indeed better for the environment than burning fossil fuels, several incidents have linked the manufacture of these shining symbols of environmental virtue to a trail of chemical pollution... the vast majority of solar cells today start as quartz, the most common form of silica (silicon dioxide), which is refined into elemental silicon. There's the first problem: The quartz is extracted from mines, putting the miners at risk of one of civilization's oldest occupational hazards, the lung disease silicosis...  The initial refining turns quartz into metallurgical-grade silicon, a substance used mostly to harden steel and other metals. That happens in giant furnaces, and keeping them hot takes a lot of energy... The next step, however—turning metallurgical-grade silicon into a purer form called polysilicon—creates the very toxic compound silicon tetrachloride... Capturing silicon from silicon tetrachloride requires less energy than obtaining it from raw silica, so recycling this waste can save manufacturers money. But the reprocessing equipment can cost tens of millions of dollars. So some operations have just thrown away the by-product. If exposed to water—and that's hard to prevent if it's casually dumped—the silicon tetrachloride releases hydrochloric acid, acidifying the soil and emitting harmful fumes."""

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“First and most urgently, we need the President and Congress together to require background checks for all gun sales – including private sales at gun shows and online. These private sales now account for more than 40 percent of all gun sales nationally – which means that in 2012 alone, there were more than six million gun sales that happened with no background checks… Second, Congress should make gun trafficking a Federal crime. In New York City, 85 percent of the weapons that we recover from crime scenes come from out-of-state sources – but Federal laws designed to curb illegal sales across borders are incredibly weak. Criminals who traffic get a slap on the wrist… The third legislative measure that the White House should support is limiting the availability of military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines with more than ten rounds. These guns and equipment are not designed for sport or home defense. They are designed to kill large numbers of people quickly. That’s the only purpose they have.”

01	Do Poll Workers Receive Adequate Training to Facilitate Elections Conducted on Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Beginning in September [2002], Diebold trainers began to fan out across Georgia to conduct hands-on training sessions for poll workers in every one of Georgia's 159 counties. As part of its contract with the state, Diebold committed to train at least two workers per precinct - typically a poll manager and an assistant. These sessions, which lasted from 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours, provided an in-depth orientation to the equipment operation and procedures. A 12 1/2 minute training videotape, produced and distributed by the Office of the Secretary of State, also offered a basic overview of set up, election operations and shut down of the equipment. More than 3000 tapes were distributed statewide. In addition to the Diebold and KSU-provided [Kennesaw State University Center for Election Systems] training on touch screen operations, all counties are required by law to train poll workers on the broader scope of duties, including voter ID requirements, checking in and accounting for voters, provisional voting procedures and other procedures, as well as assuring that every poll worker was trained on the touch screen."""
01	"Do Undocumented Immigrants Pay Their ""Fair Share"" of Taxes?"	"""Like other people living and working in the United States, undocumented immigrants pay state and local taxes. They pay sales and excise taxes when they purchase goods and services (for example, on utilities, clothing and gasoline). They pay property taxes directly on their homes or indirectly as renters. Many undocumented immigrants also pay state income taxes. The best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks.  Collectively, undocumented immigrants in the United States pay an estimated total of $11.74 billion in state and local taxes a year (see Table 1 for state-by-state estimates). This includes more than $7 billion in sales and excise taxes, $3.6 billion in property taxes, and $1.1 billion in personal income taxes.   Another way to measure the state and local taxes that undocumented immigrants pay is through their effective tax rate, which is the share of total income paid in taxes… Undocumented immigrants' nationwide average effective tax rate is an estimated 8 percent. To put this in perspective, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay an average nationwide effective tax rate of just 5.4 percent."""
10	Has DNA Testing Led to Significant Improvements in the Criminal Justice System?	"""The era of DNA testing has not ushered in a fool-proof criminal justice system. It is not true that the problems of wrongful convictions are in the past and will not happen anymore because technology can now precisely determine guilt. Nor is it true that the death penalty can proceed unchecked under the assumption that all the inmates on death row have had ample opportunity for DNA testing...  DNA exonerations represent only 12% of the total list of 116 cases. In 88% of the cases, attorneys and courts had to rely on other forms of evidence...  Many states have not passed legislation guaranteeing the right to DNA testing. Even where this right is protected by statute, such as in Texas, there are stringent limits on its use and inmates have been refused testing where the results might have affected the death sentence, even if not the determination of their guilt...  Shouldn't DNA testing ensure that only the guilty are being convicted and sentenced to death? This is not the case because most murders do not involve the exchange of bodily materials containing DNA evidence...Wrongful convictions will continue to occur as long as our criminal justice system utilizes human actors.   When newly tested DNA evidence is presented after an inmate has been convicted and sentenced to death, it is usually checked and rechecked before that inmate is ever set free. However, it appears that the same reliability cannot be attributed to the pre-trial DNA testing that can often result in a conviction and a death sentence. Recent scandals from crime labs in many parts of the country have exposed the risk of wrongful convictions that shoddy forensic work can bring.  The performance of pre-trial DNA testing is not always a reliable source of forensic information. If evidence is contaminated at the scene of the crime, if the police are not skilled in the collection of such evidence, if the police lab that performs the testing is unqualified to render reliable results, or if the state's expert is incompetent or dishonest, then evidence presented under the veil of scientific certainty becomes the very source of misinformation leading to mistake."""

Nor will I join those who say, ‘I would never choose to get married, but I think everyone should have the right.’… …[T]he push for gay marriage has shifted advocacy away from essential services like HIV education, AIDS health care, drug treatment, domestic violence prevention, and homeless care — all crucial needs for far more queers than marriage could ever be. And this pattern will undoubtedly continue, as millions of dollars will be spent fighting an anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment proposed for the November ballot, at a time when social services are being scrapped across the country, and especially in California. The spectacle around gay marriage draws attention away from critical issues — like ending U.S. wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, stopping massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across the country, and challenging the never-ending assault on anyone living outside of conventional norms. While many straight people are reaping the benefits of gay liberation and discovering new ways of loving, lusting for and caring for one another, the gay marriage movement is busy fighting for a 1950s model of white-picket fence ‘we’re just like you’ normalcy. And that’s no reason to celebrate.”

10	Is Golf a Sport?	The decision to include golf in the 2016 Summer Olympics is questionable. Golf has been excluded from the Olympics for more than a century, as have other non-sports, including croquet (last included in 1900), motorboat racing (last competition in 1908), and tug of war (last done in 1920). After being included in the 1900 and 1904 Olympic games, golf was removed for what will have been a 112-year absence before returning in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Race walking, pistol shooting, and rhythmic gymnastics have been in the Olympics longer than golf. [2] Some people believe the decision to allow golf in the Olympics was a political move based not on its merit as a sport, but as a game that attracts lucrative financial sponsorships.

01	Police Body Cameras: Top 3 Pros and Cons	Police body cameras increase the safety of the public and the police. People act differently when they know they are being filmed – police body cameras can encourage good behavior by police officers and members of the public, leading to a decrease in violence, use of force incidents, and attacks on officers on duty. [7] A study in Rialto, CA, the first US city to trial police body cameras, found an over 50% reduction in the total number of use of force incidents by police officers when body cameras were worn; complaints against officers fell from 28 in the year prior to the study to 3 during the year of the trial. [7] In Las Vegas, NV, a trial found a 37% reduction in the number of police officers involved in at least one use of force incident when equipped with body-worn cameras. [8] In San Diego, CA, use of body cameras coincided with a 16.4% decrease in high-level use of force (Tasers, pepper spray, firearms) and a 25.3% increase in low-level use of force (controlled holds and Taser warnings). [11] A pilot program in Edmonton, Canada, found that 35% of officers with body-worn cameras observed a decrease in instances of physical aggression by members of the public; [9] and a study on the Isle of Wight, UK, found a 36% decrease in assaults on police when officers were wearing cameras.

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“[The] right decision, in my view, is to allow same-sex marriage in California. Republicans believe deeply that government should be limited.

That’s true whether the couple is gay or straight… Republicans also care about jobs; and as a business proposition, it makes no sense to support Prop. 8. Discrimination at any level is bad for business. California has always made itself stronger by welcoming, not excluding, people who want to work hard and build better futures for themselves and their communities. What kind of a message does it send to workers, of any background, that we are willing to codify discrimination into our state constitution? Gay couples are asking for a chance to play by the rules.

01	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Under any new system of health care delivery, as at present, it will be far less costly to give a lethal injection than to care for a patient throughout the dying process.   The current debate about medical futility reflects, in part, the extent to which the cost of treatment is viewed as relevant to decisions at the bedside. Some physicians have argued that they should determine when the benefits of treatment are too low to justify the cost in order to allocate health care resources. To date, the futility debate has focused on certain aggressive treatments, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or on continued treatment for certain patients, such as those who are permanently unconscious. But once a decision is made not to pursue cure or treatment, and assisted suicide and euthanasia are available, the economic logic will be inescapable. The care provided to dying or very ill patients, not just their treatment, is expensive and demanding for health care professionals. The extra weeks or months of caring for patients who do not opt for assisted suicide or euthanasia will seem all the more 'futile' and costly."" "

In public opinion polls, there is a clear upward trend in support for life-without-parole sentences as a substitute for the death penalty... Moreover, the states without the death penalty have fared better in reducing their murder rates than states with the death penalty. The death penalty concentrates millions of dollars on a few people with almost no control over the outcome. (This does not even take into account the less tangible costs such as the risk of executing the innocent, or the divisiveness caused by the perceptions of racial unfairness.)

Similarly, health scientists are increasingly questioning the relevance of research aimed at ‘modeling’ human diseases in the laboratory by artificially creating symptoms in other animal species. Trying to mirror human diseases or toxicity by artificially creating symptoms in mice, dogs or monkeys has major scientific limitations that cannot be overcome. Very often the symptoms and responses to potential treatments seen in other species are dissimilar to those of human patients. As a consequence, nine out of every 10 candidate medicines that appear safe and effective in animal studies fail when given to humans. Drug failures and research that never delivers because of irrelevant animal models not only delay medical progress, but also waste resources and risk the health and safety of volunteers in clinical trials.”

Only the union of a man and a woman may involve the unique physical act from which children are created, and children best flourish when raised by their biological mother and father who are united in marriage. The legal institution of marriage has historically been the societal mechanism channeling men and women into permanent, exclusive sexual relationships to insure that the partners who participate in the creation of the child provide both material and personal support to the child. There is a growing consensus in the social science literature that clearly establishes that children do best when they are raised by both biological parents who are married to each other… Preserving the traditional institution of marriage need not eliminate any legal status for mutually supportive couples. Loving, committed relationships exist not only between same-sex couples, but also between many other individuals who are not sexually intimate. The civil institution of marriage should focus on insuring the well-being of children, but it is possible to create other legal arrangements to take care of the diversity of human relationships found in contemporary society. Creation of a reciprocal beneficiary status, like that found in Hawaii, is a viable and reasonable alternative to recognizing same-sex unions as marriage.”
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""My home country of Germany is one of the few nations to legalize prostitution. Proponents of legalization argue that all attempts to deal with the sex business have failed and the only option left untried is decriminalization...   Legalized prostitution creates the same problems that legalized marijuana does. While prostitution is legal, forced prostitution is not. The latter occurs, and the new German law unintentionally makes it harder to hunt down human traffickers, especially from Eastern Europe and Africa. Similarly, it is harder to combat under-aged prostitution. With legalized marijuana and prostitution, Amsterdam became a magnet for human traffickers, drug traders and petty criminals. This is not the world legalization’s proponents envisioned, but it happened."""
01	Is the Death Penalty Immoral?	"""The Koran says quite explicitly that God created human beings, and put into them, or put onto them a part of God’s breath. And to reach the conclusion of termination of that divinity requires that one reach a level of not just evidentiary, but a certain degree of moral certitude. And that moral certitude, although my position is not unequivocal and sort of categorical, but I find it difficult to hypothesize, to imagine abstractly a situation in which one would be so sure at a moral plain that the snuffing away or the taking away of that breath of God is justified."""

01	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""All-electronic direct-recording voting machines (DREs), in the absence of voter-verified audit trails (VVATs), provide no meaningful assurances that votes are correctly processed. Ideally, a VVAT is a human-readable medium such as paper that is also machine-readable, and forms the vote of record especially in cases of any disputes. From the perspective point of system security experts, vendor claims that VVATs are unnecessary are seriously disingenuous and contraindicated by past experience, for a variety of reasons such as the extremely weak criteria that are used for evaluation, the vendor insistence on proprietary code, an evaluation process that is proprietary and paid for by the vendors, pre- and post-election testing of equipment that generally fails to detect certain serious problems such as Trojan horses and unauthorized dynamic changes, and other clear evidence in recent elections that the claims are not justified...  Worse yet, vendors claim there is no need for the VVAT because there is no evidence of tampering. However, that completely avoids the main point: these machines allow no evidence of tampering precisely because there is no VVAT! What goes on inside the computer memories is completely inscrutable."""

10	Are Living Wills a Good Idea?	"""Most living wills instruct an attending physician to withhold or withdraw medical interventions from its signer if he is dying or in a permanetnly vegetative state. But, since the document is so vague and the attending physician may be unfamiliar with the signer's views and values, the document could be interpreted by the physician in a manner that was not intended by the signer. A Washington State case provides a sad example of this.   Mary Jo Estep, a very active retired schoolteacher, broke her hip. As part of her rehabilitation she checked into a nursing home where, on admission, she signed a living will that stated she was not to receive extraordinary measures if she was dying. A few days before she was to go home, a tired nurse gave Ms. Estep the wrong medication--a mistake that could have been reversed easily at a local hospital emergency room. But that didn't happen. Instead, a doctor wrongly interpreted her living will to mean that Estep would not want treatment... She died that night...  Mary Jo Estep's case is unusual but not unique. Other cases of overly broad interpretations of living wills have taken place."""

Bonds and Clemens are not alone in this; they are just the biggest two names of players denied entry into the Hall-of-Fame because of the belief that they compromised the game’s integrity by cheating.     Cheaters never win, baseball (as an industry) says.

Corroboree frogs, eastern bongos, regent honeyeaters, Panamanian golden frogs, Bellinger River snapping turtles, golden lion tamarins, and Amur leopards, among others, have also been saved from extinction by zoos. [16] Zoos are also working to save polar bears, tigers, and wild African elephants from habitat loss, apes and rhinos from poachers, dolphins and whales from hunters, and bees and butterflies from population declines, among many other efforts to help many other animals. [17][18][19][20] 23% of birds and 47% of small mammals (weighing less than about 2.2 pounds) are negatively impacted by climate change. [21] By keeping populations of animals and conducting wild repopulation, zoos can help preserve species in danger from climate change. There were only nine California condors in the wild in 1985. A joint conservation effort between the San Diego and Los Angeles Zoos with other organizations resulted in a population of 276 California condors in the wild and another 170 in captivity by 2016. [22][23] Przewalski's horses, the last wild horses, were declared extinct in the wild in the 1960s when about 12 lived in zoos. By 2018, breeding programs at zoos increased the number to 2,400 horses, and 800 were reintroduced to the wild. [24][25]
01	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	"The right to health care is an internationally recognized human right.

Marijuana had a modest effect on nausea, queasiness and emesis in this model of nausea induced by syrup of ipecac. The comparison drug, ondansetron, totally eliminated both the subjective feelings of nausea and the emesis.

10	Should insider trading by Congress be allowed?	"""The idea that Members of Congress or their staffs can freely step ahead of ordinary investors to profit from information acquired as a result of their legislative roles is disturbing, to say the least. While current insider trading law is more potent with regard to such activity than some of the public commentary on this issue suggests, Congress should act to eliminate any doubt and state clearly that both the trading and tipping prohibitions apply to Members and staff. It would be extremely unfortunate were the SEC or prosecutors to bring an action and have the Member or staff person raise the defense, which they surely would, that service in Congress carries with it no fiduciary-like duty to respect governmental confidences. That would be the last headline Congress should want to see.  The SEC deserves resolution of this as well. An insider trading case against a Member (or even a powerful staff person) will always be a matter of great political sensitivity, likely to be brought only to the extent that the case—legally and factually—is very strong. The external pressures to bring such cases, or not bring them, will inevitably be great when any suspicions arise. Leaving any ambiguity as to the question of whether, and to what extent, the insider trading on Capitol Hill is unlawful is hardly an encouragement to those matters that deserve to be courageously investigated and pursued. Conversely, an explicit statement by Congress that its Members and staff are subject to a duty of trust and confidence would make plain, to the SEC and the American public, that Congress expects no special privilege or treatment with respect to the rules of fair play in the U.S. capital markets.”"
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	Vaccines save children and their parents time and money. Vaccines cost less in time and money to obtain than infectious diseases cost in time off of work to care for a sick child, potential long-term disability care, and medical costs. [67] For example, children under five with the flu are contagious for about eight days, and, according to a 2012 CDC study, cost their parents an average of 11 to 73 hours of wages (about $222 to $1,456) and $300 to $4,000 in medical expenses. [68][69] Children with rotavirus are contagious for up to 30 days. [70] A 2018 study found that each case of measles in Arkansas cost the health department $47,962. [125] As of May 20, there were 880 cases of measles in 24 states in 2019, costing taxpayers an estimated $42.2 million.

10	Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?	Corporal punishment can inflict long-lasting physical and mental harm on students. A Dec. 2016 study found that children who were physically punished were more likely to have problems with aggression and attention. [15] [17] [18] Studies have shown that frequent use of corporal punishment leads to a higher risk for anxiety, depression, substance abuse, stress, and other mental health concerns. [17] [18] Children who experience corporal punishment are more likely to relate forms of violence with power, and are, therefore, more likely to be a bully or abuse a partner. [17] [18]

10	Will Increased Oil Drilling Help the US Solve Its Energy Crisis?	"""The flood of nonsense in the traditional news outlets just continues to grow. At the top of the list is the steady stream of senators or members of Congress whose response to higher gas prices is to insist on drilling in every square inch of environmentally sensitive territory in the country. This is supposed to reduce our dependence on imported oil and lower the price of gas. Both sides of this assertion are absurd...  Given our current rate of consumption of 6.9 billion barrels a year, U.S. reserves could meet our demand for oil for less than 3.5 years. That means if we could somehow drill here, now, and everywhere, we could be energy independent until the middle of 2014 and then we would be 100 percent dependent on imported oil...  Given normal assumptions about how demand responds to price, we would be very lucky to see a 6 percent decline in the price of oil. This means that in the most optimistic 'drill everywhere' scenario we would save less than 20 cents from our $4 a gallon gas. More likely the savings would be less than half this size.  In other words, when a politician says that they want to end environmental restrictions on drilling in order to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil or bring the price of gas down, they are speaking utter nonsense."""
10	Did Obamacare Change Medical Malpractice (Tort Reform) Law? - NO	"""For over a year, AAJ has been intimately involved in the health care legislation to ensure the rights of injured patients were protected.

I am very pleased to report that the health care bill is clear of any provisions that would limit an injured patient's rights concerning medical negligence claims. While there is a provision for demonstration projects, it provides an absolute opt-out clause for plaintiffs at any time. While some states may embark on demonstration programs we find objectionable, the opt-out provision for plaintiffs minimizes this concern...  AAJ was fighting tort reform in the halls of Congress...

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“[M]arriage is a keystone of our social order… There is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle. Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same-sex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives. As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation’s society. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage and seek fulfillment in its highest meaning… [T]he Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the fundamental right to marry… No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“The Obama administration’s embrace of drones is encouraging a new arms race for drones that will empower current and future rivals and lay the foundations for an international system that is increasingly violent, destabilized and polarized between those who have drones and those who are victims of them. It is ironic that Al-Qaeda’s image of the United States—as an all-seeing, irreconcilably hostile enemy who rains down bombs and death on innocent Muslims without a second thought—is inadvertently reinforced by a drones policy that does not bother to ask the names of its victims. Even the casual anti-Americanism common in many parts of Europe, the Middle East and Asia, much of which portrays the US as cruel, domineering and indifferent to the suffering of others, is reinforced by a drones policy which involves killing foreign citizens on an almost daily basis. A choice must be made: the US cannot rely on drones as it does now while attempting to convince others that these depictions are gross caricatures. Over time, an excessive reliance on drones will deepen the reservoirs of anti-US sentiment, embolden America’s enemies and provide other governments with a compelling public rationale to resist a US-led international order which is underwritten by sudden, blinding strikes from the sky.”

Everybody deserves good health care. But I am nonetheless worried about President Obama's health care reform, because without tort reform as part of the package, it can't address the labor shortage we face in my specialty.  Tort reform is crucial because it would curtail the threat of frivolous malpractice lawsuits, reward all patients who have been injured by medical mishaps, not just the wealthy with access to high-powered lawyers - and reduce the anxieties faced by young doctors going into medicine in the first place, especially those entering high-stakes fields like my own...  [M]alpractice insurance... creates a very high cost of entry into this field. Unfortunately, the health care reforms of the Obama administration have done little to curb costs. These costs are imposed by hospital inefficiencies as unpoliced by government-run insurance plans and by the price of malpractice insurance undisciplined by tort reform.

Advance care planning is a process of discussion, a component of care. Worksheets are for helping reflection and deliberation and for team building between the professionals and families and the patient. Legal documentation has a small but legitimate role.

01	Are There Physical Differences in the Brain Structure of Heterosexual and Homosexual People?	a sample of brains of homosexual men we did find that an area of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains twice as many cells as the SCN of a heterosexual group… It appears very unlikely that homosexual behavior as such would increase the neuronal number in any brain structure. Yet the development of SCN cell numbers suggest that the explanation for the large SCN in homosexual men most likely may be found in early brain development. At birth, the SCN contains only 13-20% of the adult number of cells, but in the postnatal period development is rapid. Cell counts reach a peak around 13-16 months after birth. The SCN cell numbers found in adult homosexual men were in the same order of magnitude as found around 13-16 months after birth. The normal pattern is that the cell numbers decline to the adult value of about 35% of the peak values. In homosexual men, therefore, this postnatal cell death in the SCN seems to have been curtailed.”

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Birth control pills are safer than many OTC drugs and common activities. Between 9 and 10.6 million American women use the birth control pill. [1] [2] The Pill carries no risk of overdose or addiction. [3] According to Bedsider, a nonprofit online birth control network run by doctors, “As medications go, the pill is very safe—safer than having a baby, driving, smoking, or taking daily aspirin.” [4] Joe Speidel, MD, MPH, Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health explains that pregnancy has a mortality rate about the same as car accidents--one in 8,300--while the risk of dying from birth control is about one in 1,667,000, about the same as dying from being struck by lightning. [5] And other OTC drugs carry more serious risks: non-steroidal pain pills (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen can cause stomach bleeding; Sudafed can raise blood pressure; Tylenol can cause liver toxicity; antihistamines like Benadryl can worsen glaucoma and kidney disease; and diet pills can cause irregular heart beats and raise blood pressure. [6] [7] Eve Espey, MD, MPH, Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of New Mexico, stated, “Nonsteroidal medicines kill far more people than birth-control pills.” [6] Plan B One-Step and other emergency contraception pills are available without a prescription and share the same active ingredient as daily birth control pills, levonorgestrel, but in a higher dose. [8] [9] The FDA has already indicated the safety of the drug by making Plan B available without prescription. Of 135 countries for which data are available, 96 countries representing 80.33% of the global population have OTC birth control access. [10] Read More

01	Free College - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Everyone deserves the opportunity to get a college education. Jamie Merisotis, President and CEO of the Lumina Foundation, stated, ""A dramatic increase in the number of Americans with college credentials is absolutely essential for our economic, social and cultural development as a country."" [15] The rapid rise of tuition has limited access to higher education, which is essential in today's workforce: three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations now call for education beyond high school, according to the US Department of Education. [29] College graduates earn $570,000 more than a high school graduate over a lifetime, on average, and they have lower unemployment rates. [16] [17] Students from low- and moderate-income families are unable to afford as many as 95% of American colleges. [30] Max Page, PhD, Professor of Architecture, and Dan Clawson, PhD, Professor of Sociology, both at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, stated: ""A century ago high school was becoming a necessity, not a luxury; today the same is happening to college. If college is essential for building a career and being a full participant in our democracy as high school once was, shouldn't it be free, paid for by public dollars, and treated as a right of all members of our country?""

10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	"The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all able-bodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed. According to the United States Code, a ""militia"" is composed of all ""able-bodied males at least 17 years of age… under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard."" [99] Therefore, the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and, in turn, that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. [100] A 1792 federal law required that every man eligible for militia service own a gun and ammunition suitable for military service, report for frequent inspection of their guns, and register their gun ownership on public records. [101] Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, ""the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that 'well-regulated' militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to 'insure domestic Tranquility' and 'provide for the common defence.'""

10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“[We] conclude that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms does not include, in any degree, the right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public… The Second Amendment may or may not protect to some degree a right of a member of the general public to carry a firearm in public. If there is such a right, it is only a right to carry a firearm openly.”
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Dramatic changes in precipitation, such as heavier storms and less snow, are another sign that humans are causing global climate change. As human-produced greenhouse gases heat the planet, increased humidity (water vapor in the atmosphere) results. Water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas. [112] In a process known as a positive feedback loop, more warming causes more humidity which causes even more warming. [113] Higher humidity levels also cause changes in precipitation. According to a 2013 report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the recorded changes in precipitation over land and oceans ""are unlikely to arise purely due to natural climate variability."" [48] Higher temperatures from global warming are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western United States (1950-1999) were human-induced. [111] Since 1991, heavy precipitation events have been 30% above the 1901-1960 average in the Northeast, Midwest, and upper Great Plains regions. [16] A 2015 study found that global warming caused by human actions has increased extreme precipitation events by 18% across the globe, and that if temperatures continue to rise an increase of 40% can be expected.

But with every day that passes, Israeli settlement policies further cement a one-state reality on the ground, making the two-state solution harder to imagine, let alone achieve...  And that is why, on behalf of Americans for Peace Now, I urge you here today to finally take action in the Security Council to send a clear message to Israel that the international community stands by the two-state solution and unambiguously rejects policies that undermine it – including Israeli settlement policies."""

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Despite no global warming in 10 years and recording setting cold in 2007-2008, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC) and computer modelers who believe that CO2 is the cause of global warming still predict the Earth is in store for catastrophic warming in this century… Global warming of the past century (0.8° C) is virtually insignificant when compared to the magnitude of at least 10 global climate changes in the past 15,000 years. None of these sudden global climate changes could possibly have been caused by human CO2 input to the atmosphere because they all took place long before anthropogenic CO2 emissions began. The cause of the ten earlier ‘natural’ climate changes was most likely the same as the cause of global warming from 1977 to 1998… The Pacific Ocean has a warm temperature mode and a cool temperature mode, and in the past century, has switched back forth between these two modes every 25-30 years (known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO). In 1977 the Pacific abruptly shifted from its cool mode (where it had been since about 1945) into its warm mode, and this initiated global warming from 1977 to 1998… Global warming (i.e, the warming since 1977) is over. The minute increase of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere (0.008%) was not the cause of the warming – it was a continuation of natural cycles that occurred over the past 500 years.”
01	Does Illegal Immigration Disadvantage American Workers?	"""There are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country and we also admit over a million permanent legal immigrants each year, leading to enormous implications for the U.S. labor market. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that there are some 58 million working-age (16 to 65) native-born Americans not working — unemployed or out of the labor market entirely. This is roughly 16 million more than in 2000. Equally troubling, wages have stagnated or declined for most American workers. This is especially true for the least educated, who are most likely to compete with immigrants (legal and illegal).   Anyone who has any doubt about how bad things are can see for themselves at the bureau's website, which shows that, as of November, there were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants."""
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“We have to do something about what they’re [young kids] seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games.

You see these movies, they’re so violent, and yet a kid is able to see the movie if sex isn’t involved, but killing is involved, and maybe we need to put a rating system for that.”
10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	"School uniforms emphasize the socio-economic divisions they are supposed to eliminate. Most public schools with uniform policies are in poor neighborhoods, emphasizing the class distinctions that uniforms were supposed to eliminate. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 47% of high-poverty public schools required school uniforms, while only 6% of low-poverty public schools required them. [23] Even within one school, uniforms cannot conceal the differences between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots."" David L. Brunsma, PhD, stated that ""more affluent families buy more uniforms per child. The less affluent... they have one... It's more likely to be tattered, torn and faded. It only takes two months for socioeconomic differences to show up again."" [9] According to the Children's Society (UK), almost 800,000 pupils go to school in poorly fitted uniforms because their parents cannot afford new items. [93] Uniforms also emphasize racial divisions. Schools with a minority student population of 50% or more are four times as likely to require uniforms than schools with a minority population of 20-49%, and 24 times more likely than schools with minority populations of 5%-19%.

10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	Guaranteed benefits would be reduced significantly under a privatized system. In order to fund private retirement accounts, special insurance protections that are provided by Social Security, such as disability and survivor's insurance, would need to be reduced. A 2005 Century Foundation analysis of the Bush Administration's privatization proposal demonstrated that the diversion of payroll taxes to private accounts would reduce benefit levels by 44% below their 2005 levels by 2052. [45] Economist Dean Baker estimated that an average 15-year-old in 2005 who retires in 2055 stands to lose more than $160,000 of his scheduled benefits under Bush's plan, and gain less than a third of that loss back from his investment in a private account.

Prostitution has been a career option for some people since history began. Nothing any law has done has changed or will change that. Sex workers provide a service which is needed and wanted by many...  I cannot accept that in this day and age our nation should continue to make criminals of sex workers because the Bible says it is wrong. In the first place, Christianity is not the state religion of New Zealand, and even within Christianity there are different interpretations of the Bible and related teachings. Secondly, the only prostitutes directly condemned in the Bible were those who used sex as a method of worship, which is not something commonly practised in this country.  The Bible takes a much stronger stand against adultery than against common whoredom, but I doubt that even the more conservative among us would wish to see adulterers cooling their heels in Auckland Central police station...  And I don't lack a conscience because I believe we would all be better off in a society which had the honesty to accept the job choice that some adults make as valid and worthy of care and compassion, for all our sakes."""
01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“I believe that, as a gun owner, I have a responsibility to my family and my community to store my gun safely, locked and unloaded. I also have a responsibility to advocate for responsible gun laws that help keep guns out of dangerous people’s hands. That includes being willing to submit to a background check every time I purchase a firearm and expecting buyers to submit to a current background check if I sell them a gun. Furthermore, I believe that if I misuse my gun, for example if I violently threaten a family member or allow a child to gain access to a loaded and unlocked firearm, I should be held accountable for my actions… Being concerned about the thirty-thousand-plus gun deaths each year in the United States does not make you anti-gun. And advocating for policies that make a dangerous product a little less dangerous just means you care about saving lives and countless grief from preventable firearm injuries and death. However, this message is so controversial that the gun industry, who thinks the Second Amendments trumps the First, wants to silence it.”
10	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""[T]he human greenhouse gas contribution to current warming is insignificant...  If current warming is not due to increasing greenhouse gases, what are the natural causes that might be responsible for both warming and cooling episodes – as so amply demonstrated in the historic, pre-industrial climate record? Empirical evidence suggests very strongly that the main cause of warming and cooling on a decadal scale derives from solar activity via its modulation of cosmic rays that in turn affect atmospheric cloudiness. According to published research, cosmic-ray variations are also responsible for major climate changes observed in the paleo-record going back 500 million years...  In conclusion, this NIPCC report falsifies the principal IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] conclusion that the reported warming (since 1979) is very likely caused by the human emission of greenhouse gases. In other words, increasing carbon dioxide is not responsible for current warming. Policies adopted and called for in the name of 'fighting global warming' are unnecessary."""

Our data suggest that a large share of people gaining insurance became newly enrolled in employer coverage. While this may seem surprising, given the intense media attention focused on the Marketplaces, employer coverage is by far the largest source of insurance among Americans under age 65, and the ACA creates new incentives for people to take up employer policies. Specifically, while the ACA mandates that most individuals must enroll in insurance, people are generally ineligible for Marketplace subsidies if they have an affordable offer of coverage from their employer... Furthermore, our results find no significant change in access to ESI from 2013 to 2014, in contrast to the concern that employers would drop ESI...  The ACA has greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States, with minimal effect on those who were insured before the major provisions of the law took effect.

10	Is Expanding Nuclear Energy Production Necessary to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""Global warming is without doubt humanity's greatest challenge. In responding to this challenge, we need to accept that radical action is needed. Nuclear power has been put forward as part of a sensible energy policy for reducing CO2 emissions, sometimes by unexpected people including Patrick Moore, the co-founder of Greenpeace. Given the way this claim is reported it is understandable that many people assume that it is correct. This assumption can and should be questioned...  The claim of the nuclear industry that nuclear power emits low levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is not based on scientifically verifiable evidence. Emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2, often with Global Warming Potentials many thousands of times larger than carbon dioxide, by nuclear power never have been investigated and/or published. Absence of data definitely does not mean absence of greenhouse gas emissions...  It is true that the operation of a nuclear reactor emits virtually no CO2, but this is not true of the nuclear power system as a whole [mining and processing of uranium and the construction of the nuclear power plant itself]...Our calculations indicate that within 45 to 70 years (depending on the scenario) nuclear power will emit as much CO2 emissions as a gas-fired power plant...  If the full nuclear chain [mining and processing of uranium and the construction of the nuclear power plant itself] is taken into account, as it should be, nuclear power emits much more carbon dioxide per delivered kilowatt-hour than wind power...

01	Is Marinol Better Medicine Than Marijuana?	approval of Marinol by the FDA in 1985 showed that synthetic THC was judged by the legal process used to approve medicines to be a safe and effective medicine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting. That is not the same thing as approving ‘marijuana’ as a ‘medicine.’ There is no possibility of approval of any plant as a medicine to treat any illness, now or ever because the chemicals in whole plants (to say nothing of smoked plants which are composed of many, many more chemicals) could be approved as a medicine. Plants are unstable mixtures of different chemicals which cannot be used directly to provide a ‘dose’ of a specific chemical to be used as a medical treatment. To think that the approval of Marinol by the FDA meant that marijuana was approved by the FDA as a medicine is to misunderstand both what medicines are and the value of the modern approval process for specific chemicals to be used as medicines.”

The legalization of prostitution in some parts of Australia has thus resulted in a net growth of the industry.

"""The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that a person's ability to pay cannot affect their right to vote, and the 24th Amendment explicitly renders the poll tax unconstitutional.   Yet in Arizona, ex-offenders who have completed all other terms of their sentence for a first conviction, including prison, parole and probation terms, cannot participate in the political process unless they pay their legal financial obligations...   Like its historical predecessor, the poll tax, this law disproportionately impacts low-income voters and people of color."""
01	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legalized because that allows for more scrutiny and application of the safeguards. The practice is happening regardless of the legal status; keeping it illegal has the potential to cause more harm than good as it restricts access to knowledgeable social services and health care providers who may help patients and families explore other options to achieving a good death, leaving PAS [physician-assisted suicide] as truly an option of last resort."""
01	Is the Death Penalty Immoral?	"""We, like Jesus, should feel free to side with the condemned, forgive those who hurt us, who injure or kill those we love, and in this way put an end to wheel of violence that keeps going around.

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""That two-state ""solution"" has never been a solution at all. In fact, it's just one of the many U.S. policies supposedly meant to support peace that has done just the opposite...  Israelis have agreed to a Palestinian state at least four times since 1947. The Palestinians have rejected it each time. The U.S. and Europe have responded each time by providing more economic aid to the Palestinians and pressuring Israel to make more concessions. That hasn't worked...  Israel should continue to build and expand, and annex all the existing West Bank territories into Israel proper. Israeli citizenship, with all the rights and privileges it entails, should be offered to all its inhabitants. This is not a crazy idea, but a simple recipe that worked in Israel proper for generations and has produced too many Jewish and Arab success stories to count...  Arabs, Jews, and Christians are living relatively peacefully and much more prosperously in Israel proper and have been for years. It's time for everyone living in the West Bank territories to enjoy the same rights and opportunities and not the time for anyone to insist on more racially and religiously segregated states."""
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Unfortunately, a tangle of antiquated laws in New York grant teachers what amounts to lifetime job protection, meaning they are entitled to continue teaching even if they perform poorly year after year… After only a few years in the classroom, almost all teachers earn ‘tenure.’ With tenure, teachers gain extensive job protections… All told, it can take up to 18 months and cost taxpayers $250,000 to replace a single poorly-performing teacher… Teachers who failed to receive a satisfactory rating, missed entire weeks of work, or even physically abused students can remain in the classroom over the objections of their schools… To make matters worse, New York’s antiquated laws make it illegal for schools to keep their best teachers when layoffs become necessary.”
01	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""It is always possible to modify a voting machine in a laboratory. That proves nothing. The question is whether any tampering is feasible involving a large number of machines under real election conditions. No one has even proposed, let alone demonstrated, a plausible scenario by which that might be done. Each machine is an island never connected to the internet. The software cannot be modified during an election — any tampering would have to be done in advance in a guarded warehouse that is under video surveillance. It can’t be done quickly, either. Machines must be forklifted off high shelves, seals must be broken, new stealth software installed and forged seals applied...  To this day, no evidence exists that any electronic voting machine used in an election in the United States has been tampered with, or even that any attempt has been made to perform such tampering."""
10	Is Large-Scale Wind Power Production Environmentally Friendly?	"""Construction and operation of wind-energy facilities directly influence ecosystem structure. Site preparation activities, large machinery, transportation of turbine elements, and 'feeder lines,' transmission lines that lead from the wind-energy facility to the electricity grid, all can lead to removal of vegetation, disturbance, and compaction of soil, soil erosion, and changes in hydrologic features. Although many of these activities are relatively local and short-term in practice (e.g., construction), there may be substantial effects on habitat quality for a variety of organisms... Wind-energy development that is focused on topographic features that are limited in extent (e.g., ridgelines) and that represent key habitat features for some species may have disproportionately detrimental impacts on those species that depend on or are closely associated with these habitats."""
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“When Cuba joins the rest of the civilized world in how it treats its people… That’s the kind of country that I’m interested in us having a relationship with. And the embargo serves as leverage for us to be able to accomplish that… Cuba trades with every other country in the world. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. embargo is not the reason their economy is failing. Their economy is failing because they’ve embraced a combination of socialism and incompetence, which may be an oxymoron because they’re both the same thing… What’s happening now is that the Castro government is using travel and exile travel as a way to fund its repressive regime… And it also provides a source of hard currency for the Castro regime. They use the dollars from remittances and from travel to fund their repressive operation. I think it was wrong to lift those travel restrictions.”
01	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""Certainly, suffering at the end of life is sometimes unavoidable and unbearable, and helping people end their misery may be necessary.

10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""In 1990, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I wrote the Anabolic Steroids Control Act, which added 'anabolic steroids' to Schedule Three of the Controlled Substances Act and began to list a host of substances falling within that definition. In 2004, I proposed legislation to update that law and added the substances 'THG' and 'Andro,' and their chemical cousins, to the list of anabolic steroids.  The reasons for these changes were simple: these substances not only pose great health risks, but they threaten the fundamental integrity of sport and send the wrong message to our kids – that cheating to get ahead is acceptable, no matter the cost.  So I worked hard to ban these substances, educate our youth and professional athletes, and reduce this wrongful behavior in American sports."""
01	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Students, educators, and institutions are using iPad to inspire creativity and hands-on learning that makes learning more powerful… Schools report that academic performance – as measured by standardized test scores and other key student outcomes – is improving with iPad use. A number of K-12 schools, districts, and higher education institutions have reported seeing substantial gains when comparing current student test scores with prior-year test scores, pre- and post-test measures, and classrooms without iPad… From preschool to college, reports from institutions overwhelmingly indicate that students using iPad find that it increases their engagement in learning and makes them feel more motivated to learn. Other positive outcomes include an increase in attendance and a decrease in discipline problems and dropout rates.”
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“Good schools know how every student is doing in every subject every day. They don’t need a week of testing in the spring to tell them what they already know… One problem with state-mandated tests is that they don’t take advantage of everything teachers know about their students… It’s time to end a century of standardized testing and focus instead on helping young people do work that matters. We no longer need to interrupt learning and test kids to find out what they know. A couple of brave state policy leaders could trigger what would be a quick change because everyone hates the tests.”
10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“The most common form of a general cut in business taxes is a reduction in the corporate tax rate. This approach, however, is not a particularly cost-effective method of stimulating business spending: Increasing the after-tax income of businesses typically does not create an incentive for them to spend more on labor or to produce more, because production depends on the ability to sell output.”

A few years ago, it would not have been possible to issue such a challenge. But here's what's changed: the sharp cost reductions now beginning to take place in solar, wind, and geothermal power - coupled with the recent dramatic price increases for oil and coal - have radically changed the economics of energy...  Our families cannot stand 10 more years of gas price increases. Our workers cannot stand 10 more years of job losses and outsourcing of factories. Our economy cannot stand 10 more years of sending $2 billion every 24 hours to foreign countries for oil.

10	Does Illegal Immigration Disadvantage American Workers?	"""While we find that, overall, there are enough out-of-work natives to replace undocumented workers, there is a severe mismatch between the skills of undocumented workers and the natives who would potentially replace them. Moreover... all out-of-work natives would not otherwise find work. Clearly, a certain share of natives are unemployed due to the normal functioning of the labor market (socalled 'frictional' unemployment) and will find work regardless of what happens with undocumented workers...  The largest share of out-of-work natives have a high school diploma, where approximately 3.1 million potentially need jobs, 1.2 million more than the number of undocumented workers with a high school diploma. If the undocumented immigrants were removed from the work force, these natives would either remain out-of-work or would need to find jobs requiring lower levels of education... Removing undocumented workers from the economy would not be a panacea for native unemployment."""
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Nowhere does the Bible repudiate capital punishment for premeditated murder; not only is the death penalty for deliberate killing of a fellow human being permitted, but it is approved and encouraged, and for any government that attaches at least as much value to the life of an innocent victim as to a deliberate murderer, it is ethically imperative."""
01	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""A growing body of scientific research indicates that we face extreme dangers to human health, economic well-being, and the ecosystems on which we depend if global average temperatures are allowed to increase by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit from today's levels. We have good prospects of staying below this temperature increase if atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other global warming gases are kept from exceeding 450 ppm (parts per million) CO2-equivalent and then rapidly reduced. To make this possible requires immediate steps to reduce global emissions over the next several decades, including action to halt U.S. emissions growth within the next few years and then cut emissions by approximately 80% by mid-century. This goal is ambitious, but achievable... Fortunately, a wide variety of tools is available today to achieve those reductions – but we will need all the tools at our disposal. One such tool is Carbon Capture & Sequestration (CCS)...  Given the world's and the nation's dependence on fossil fuels, it is essential to have in place a technology and a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities that burn these fuels, even though their complete phase-out through energy efficiency improvements and a transition to renewable fuel sources might be technically and theoretically possible. Using all available tools is a wise and necessary hedging strategy in the face of the steep emission cuts that are needed. Projections differ as to the exact portion of reductions that will be delivered by different technologies, but from a strategic point of view, CCS provides a much needed answer for fossil fuel use – which is inevitable."""
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“But I am tired of the damaging and erroneous idea that abortion is a positive thing for women. I have met so many women that profoundly grieve having been involved in an abortion. I’ve talked to a dad who lost his daughter to legal abortion. There is study after study showing the negative consequences of abortion–be it emotionally or physically. Because of the cause of ‘reproductive rights,’ approximately 30 million females are missing in the United States today – future Olympic athletes, scientists, doctors, artists, teachers, sisters, mothers, daughters, lawmakers, and maybe even a President. Women deserve the truth about this issue. Abortion is profoundly anti-woman. Choosing life is empowering, not taking the life of your precious little one.”

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“I have always supported a definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman. To me, this debate is about stable families, good environments for raising children, and religious belief. It is not about discriminating against anyone. No society has limited marriage to heterosexual couples because of a desire to create second-class families. This differs from treatment of interracial marriages. Traditional marriage in many states until the 1960’s was limited racially for reasons that had nothing to do with the creation of marriage as an institution and everything to do with racial discrimination. Loving v. Virginia, which has been referenced a number of times, has nothing to do with gay marriage.”
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"More than one thousand scientists disagree that human activity is primarily responsible for global climate change. In 2010 Climate Depot released a report featuring more than 1,000 scientists, several of them former UN IPCC scientists, who disagreed that humans are primarily responsible for global climate change. [55] The Cook review [1] of 11,944 peer-reviewed studies found 66.4% of the studies had no stated position on anthropogenic global warming, and while 32.6% of the studies implied or stated that humans are contributing to climate change, only 65 papers (0.5%) explicitly stated ""that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming."" [54] A 2012 Purdue University survey found that 47% of climatologists challenge the idea that humans are primarily responsible for climate change and instead believe that climate change is caused by an equal combination of humans and the environment (37%), mostly by the environment (5%), or that there’s not enough information to say (5%).

Millions of kids still dream about playing in the major leagues. They have posters of Nomar Garciaparra, Barry Bonds and Randy Johnson on their bedroom walls.

10	Is Prostitution a Victimless Crime?	"""Prostitution is often described as a 'victimless crime', or a 'consensual crime', because in theory, no one present at the crime is unwilling. In reality, this is a myth. In reality, prostitution of women is a particularly lethal form of violence against women, and a violation of a woman's most basic human rights.   It is rarely the media-approved version of prostitution, a sexy and highly-paid adventure where business is conducted at upscale bars and in hotel rooms; though some sex workers do have that experience, most do not. For the vast majority of prostituted women, prostitution is the experience of being hunted, dominated, harassed, assaulted and battered.  Sadly, the majority of girls enter prostitution before they have reached the age of consent. In other words, their first commercial sexual interactions are rape...  Another myth is that most women and girls choose to enter the sex industry. Again, while this is true for a small number of sex workers, the research indicates that for the vast majority of women and girls, it is a highly constrained choice. Ultimately, viewing prostitution as a genuine 'choice' for women, such as secretarial work or waitressing, diminishes the possibility of getting women out and improving their lives."""
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Articles about marijuana legalization tend to focus on income — how much money will come in because of the commercialization of marijuana — but rarely focus on the cost. Homelessness, mental health and drug treatment are often factors on the cost side of the marijuana equation. In many communities, homelessness increased after marijuana legalization. Marijuana is scientifically linked with psychosis and the onset of several other mental health issues. And in San Diego County, marijuana is now the primary drug of choice among youth and almost all adults in treatment say they started with marijuana. So drug addiction treatment costs also need to be considered. Not to mention the social costs when drug users don’t get treatment. Do the math – marijuana commercialization, income versus cost, leaves communities short-changed.”

While the gateway theory has enjoyed popular acceptance, scientists have always had their doubts. Our study shows that these doubts are justified… The people who are predisposed to use drugs and have the opportunity to use drugs are more likely than others to use both marijuana and harder drugs.

10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Direct-to-consumer drug advertising works very well – for pharmaceutical company profits, but not for the public health… Some argue that the First Amendment protects direct-to-consumer drug advertising. However, restrictions on commercial speech exist when the outcome of the speech can be harmful to the public. The Federal Communications Commission no longer allows tobacco ads to appear on TV. Following the same logic, prescription-drug ads should be taken off the air. Drug advertising results in more costly prescriptions. Few inexpensive drugs are advertised on TV. The commercials don’t educate patients. Rather, they create a demand for a product based on an effective commercial rather than the patient’s medical need… Direct-to-consumer ads should be banned. Doctors and patients have much to gain. Only the pharmaceutical industry has anything to lose.”

01	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders. In part, capital punishment is an expression of society's moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct.  This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes, rather than self-help, to vindicate their wrongs...  The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they 'deserve,' then there are sown the seeds of anarchy -- of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law."""

The Oath clearly states: 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.'...

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the CSA, continues to support that placement and FDA concurred because marijuana met the three criteria for placement in Schedule I under 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1) (e.g., marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision). Furthermore, there is currently sound evidence that smoked marijuana is harmful. A past evaluation by several Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA), concluded that no sound scientific studies supported medical use of marijuana for treatment in the United States, and no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use.”
01	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Clean raw milk from pastured cows is a complete and properly balanced food... About 80% of the proteins in milk are caseins - reasonably heat stable but easy to digest. The remaining 20% or so fall into the class of whey proteins, many of which have important physiological effects (bioactivity). Also easy to digest, but very heat sensitive, these include key enzymes (specialized proteins) and enzyme inhibitors, immunoglobulins (antibodies), metal-binding proteins, vitamin binding proteins and several growth factors... Studies have shown significant loss of these important disease fighters when milk is heated to normal processing temperatures...   Lactose, or milk sugar, is the primary carbohydrate in cow's milk. Made from one molecule each of the simple sugars glucose and galactose, it's known as a disaccharide. People with lactose intolerance for one reason or another (age, genetics, etc.), no longer make the enzyme lactase and so can't digest milk sugar. This leads to some unsavory symptoms, which, needless to say, the victims find rather unpleasant at best. Raw milk, with its lactose-digesting Lactobacilli bacteria intact, may allow people who traditionally have avoided milk to give it another try."""

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	"Women are responsible and knowledgeable enough to care for their own bodies. Alison Block, MD, physician, said: “My main philosophy as someone who provides reproductive health care is to trust women to make their own decisions. The idea that they have to [have a] conversation with a doctor to decide which method is best for them seems overly paternalistic and unnecessary."" [30]Often, doctors will only prescribe birth control pills once a patient has visited and had a pelvic exam. However, Pap smears are now recommended every three years instead of every year, and only after a woman has turned 21. [31] Nancy Stanwood, MD, obstetrician and Board Chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, stated, “We were holding pregnancy prevention hostage to cancer screening [Pap smears]. They’re both worthwhile goals, but one should not be held hostage to the other.” [31]Women can sort out for themselves whether hormonal birth control is right for them. In one study, 98% of women matched their doctors’ medical evaluations about whether they could use hormonal birth control. The women were more cautious about contraindications (medical reasons not to take a drug) such as headaches, smoking, and potential pregnancy than their doctors were. [32] The Border Contraceptive Access Study found that women who got the Pill OTC from a pharmacy in Mexico were adequately self-screening for contraindications. [33] Read More"

10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""Some people suggest that since athletes are going to dope anyway why not just let them?... The collateral damage, though, to both public health and the meaning of sport, would likely be severe...   Not everyone will resort to doping but, if we remove both legal controls and the stigma attached to it, many will. The likely result is a public health crisis, with particularly dire consequences for young people...  When a drug exists that can significantly enhance performance and you believe that your competitors are using it, you have three unhappy options. You can hold fast to your principles knowing you may lose to an inferior competitor without your scruples; you can stop competing at this level; or you can dope like the others. The point of anti-doping is to create a fourth option: to compete clean with reasonable confidence that your fellow athletes are doing the same."""
10	Does Marijuana Use Increase the Risk of Psychosis (Including Schizophrenia)?	that the incidence of schizophrenia declined substantially in Western societies in the 1970s, at the same time cannabis use was rising, it seems highly unlikely that marijuana causes schizophrenia in otherwise healthy people…. Cannabis psychosis is self-limiting, disappearing in a few days with or without medical treatment. Toxic psychosis probably occurs more commonly in individuals with preexisting psychiatric disorders…. Marijuana temporarily alters mood, thought, emotions, and perception, sometimes quite dramatically. None of marijuana’s effects cause people to behave in any particular manner. In the midst of a toxic psychosis, people may become agitated and frightened. In response to acute panic, people may become withdrawn and inactive. Neither of these states eliminates the social and moral restraints that guide human behavior.”
01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“Many of my fellow conservatives have an almost knee-jerk hostility toward gay marriage. This does not make sense, because same-sex unions promote the values conservatives prize. Marriage is one of the basic building blocks of our neighborhoods and our nation. At its best, it is a stable bond between two individuals who work to create a loving household and a social and economic partnership. We encourage couples to marry because the commitments they make to one another provide benefits not only to themselves but also to their families and communities. Marriage requires thinking beyond one’s own needs. It transforms two individuals into a union based on shared aspirations, and in doing so establishes a formal investment in the well-being of society. The fact that individuals who happen to be gay want to share in this vital social institution is evidence that conservative ideals enjoy widespread acceptance. Conservatives should celebrate this, rather than lament it. Legalizing same-sex marriage would also be a recognition of basic American principles, and would represent the culmination of our nation’s commitment to equal rights. It is, some have said, the last major civil-rights milestone yet to be surpassed in our two-century struggle to attain the goals we set for this nation at its formation.”

They aren’t… To their minds, religion (and especially the traditional Christian faith) will always be something that contaminates American culture – corrupting our laws, rather than undergirding and informing them. They will always see God as a threat to human freedom, and those who believe in Him as a danger to the ACLU’s own thoroughly humanistic agenda.”

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“We are in the midst of a significant period of drone proliferation, pushed forward on the one hand by governments and militaries, and on the other, by manufacturers seeking to expand markets and profit. Unchecked armed drone proliferation poses a threat to global stability, and, as more countries and non-state actors obtain access to the technology, the risk of US-style practices of cross-border targeted killing spreading are clear… The ways in which the US has used drones in the context of its targeted killing policies has facilitated an undermining of the constraints of democratic accountability, and rendered resort to lethal force easier and more attractive to policymakers. The decision to use military force must be subject to rigorous checks-and-balances; drones, however, have facilitated the use of killing as a convenient option that avoids the potential political fallout from US casualties and the challenges posed by detention… With policymakers making critical decisions about US policy outside the public’s view, and an utter lack of any real transparency and accountability, the rule of law is undermined and a democratic deficit created.”
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	Violent video games reinforce fighting as a means of dealing with conflict by rewarding the use of violent action with increased life force, more weapons, moving on to higher levels, and more. [59] Studies suggest that when violence is rewarded in video games, players exhibit increased aggressive behavior compared to players of video games where violence is punished.[23] The reward structure is one distinguishing factor between violent video games and other violent media such as movies and television shows, which do not reward viewers nor allow them to actively participate in violence. [59] An analysis of 81 video games rated for teens ages 13 and up found that 73 games (90%) rewarded injuring other characters, and 56 games (69%) rewarded killing. [71] People who played a video game that rewarded violence showed higher levels of aggressive behavior and aggressive cognition as compared with people who played a version of the same game that was competitive but either did not contain violence or punished violence.

"""There is only one solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if 'solution' means ending the conflict, and that is two states for two peoples.

Each side is fighting for a land they can call their own, on which they express their identity, and through which their identity is expressed. Both movements are fighting over the same piece of land. The option of one united peaceful state with a homogenized identity – the United States of Israel-Palestine – is not real because neither side wants a homogenized identity; both sides are willing to continue to fight, with even more passion and venom so that the one state takes on their own identity.   When I meet Israelis and Palestinians who advocate the so-called 'one state solution,' as soon as I dig below the nice slogans, what I find is that the Israelis are talking about a Jewish state with a large Arab minority and the Palestinians are talking about a Palestinian state with a large Jewish minority. Neither side of the so-called 'one-staters' is really willing to give up its dream of the territorial expression of its identity.  So like it or not… we do not have a choice – there has to be a two-state solution, and obviously the longer we procrastinate in making the hard decisions, the more difficult it will be."""

If a full background check had been completed, my mother, cousins and six other loved ones would still be alive today… Between 2010 and 2016, the Charleston loophole allowed nearly 23,000 gun sales to dangerous people who would have failed a criminal background check because the check could not be completed within three business days. After the three-day period has expired, federal law allows gun stores to sell a gun to a prospective buyer, even though the background check is not complete… Background checks that have been completed have blocked more than two million sales to people who failed a background check, and have saved countless lives.”

01	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Ordinary, law-abiding citizens who own handguns and carry licensed, concealed weapons rarely use their guns except in matters of self-defense. Criminals and those who carry illegal and unlicensed firearms are typically those who commit violent crimes. It is a fact that in communities where citizens have been granted licenses to carry concealed weapons and are not restricted from keeping loaded guns in their homes, crime rates drop. Such conditions have proven to be a deterrent to crimes such as home invasions, burglaries, muggings and car-jackings because criminals will not risk being confronted by a victim’s firearm. Tightening laws restricting the use and possession of firearms does not protect average law-abiding citizens; it only puts them at greater risk. Enforcing licensing restrictions, trigger locks, and waiting periods makes it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and as a result encourages criminal activity. Only criminals benefit when ordinary citizens are deprived of their right to own a firearm and protect themselves, their homes, and their families.”

10	Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Student loan discharge would incite colleges to raise tuition. Student debt elimination through bankruptcy would encourage increased borrowing, and more borrowing leads to higher tuition.

[27] Abigail Hall Blanco, PhD, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tampa, said, ""loan forgiveness would be one giant subsidy, creating perverse incentives for both schools and students. If schools knew the government would forgive the cost of their students' education, they'd face no incentive to cut costs to keep tuition down.""

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Drug manufacturers are unlikely to make the Pill OTC, so improved access has to be accomplished through other means. Drug makers to date have little interest in going through the process to make a drug over-the-counter because it can take a long time and the costs are significant. [30] Only the drug manufacturer can initiate this process with the FDA, who decides on the prescription or OTC status of a drug based on applications submitted voluntarily by the manufacturers. Lawmakers cannot change the status of a drug from prescription to OTC. Further, any decision involving birth control can be politically controversial. [65]Instead, some states are making birth control available without a prescription, but not over-the-counter. In those states, a pharmacist is required to ask the patient a few questions, notes blood pressure and weight, and dispenses birth control from behind the pharmacy counter. Several states including California, Maryland, Tennessee, and Washington allow birth control without a prescription. California, Maryland, and DC even allow 12-month supplies to be dispensed at once, which has been found to reduce unintended pregnancies by 30% and the odds of an abortion by 46%. [66] [67] The birth control in these cases is covered by insurance. [66] A study found that 68% of women would use birth control if it were available via a pharmacist and 63% agreed the pharmacist consultation was an important step. [68]Women in some states can access birth control via an app or website from private companies. Insurance covers some of these prescriptions, and all that is generally required is a brief consultation to assess risks and appropriate medication, sometimes by video chat. [69] Some services deliver the birth control to the patient, eliminating the need to stop by a pharmacy. [70] [71] [72] Read More

In those six years not a single thing that the White House wanted to do got done… Throw in a grotesquely stupid scandal, involving his own personal behavior, that overtakes every day of his presidency for a year, and it becomes one of history’s least important presidencies, in terms of actually setting some kind of direction or establishing some kind of principle that goes forward beyond that presidency.

"""If President Barack Obama wants to stop the descent toward dangerous global climate change, and avoid the trade anarchy that current approaches to this problem will invite, he should take Al Gore's proposal for a carbon tax and make it global. A tax on CO2 emissions -- not a cap-and-trade system -- offers the best prospect of meaningfully engaging China and the U.S., while avoiding the prospect of unhinged environmental protectionism.  China emphatically opposes a hard emissions cap on its economy. Yet China must be part of any climate deal or within 25 years... its emissions of CO2 could amount to twice the combined emissions of the world's richest nations, including the United States, Japan and members of the European Union...  Cap-and-traders assume, without much justification, that one country can put a price on carbon emissions while another doesn't without affecting trade or investment decisions. This is a bad assumption...  [A]dministering billions of dollars of carbon credits in a cap-and-trade system in an already chaotic regulatory environment would invite a civil war between interest groups seeking billions in carbon credit handouts and the regulator holding the kitty. By contrast, a uniform tax on CO2 emissions levied at a small number of large sites would be relatively clear-cut."""
01	Is Nuclear Power Cost-Effective?	"""In the 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush affirmed the nation's commitment to 'safe, clean nuclear energy' as part of a diverse portfolio that will meet America's future electricity needs. A long-term commitment to nuclear energy will make the United States more energy independent and energy efficient...  Based on many years of experience in operating nuclear power plants, I am convinced that nuclear power offers a clean and cost-effective answer to many of our nation's current and future energy needs."""
10	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""The concept of CCS is that we can curb climate change by capturing the emissions from coal plants and store them underground, safely away from our atmosphere for eternity. The most glaring flaw in this concept is that CCS technology is not likely to be a commercially viable option for at least another decade, and new coal-fired plants are slated to begin construction now. There are also no working models of CCS at a commercial-scale power plant anywhere in the world...  Proposals for carbon storage locations include underground depleted oil and gas fields, unmineable coal seams, and even in our oceans. Underground storage of the 1.9 billion tons of C02 waste produced annually by U.S. coal plants is hugely problematic and likely impossible. Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal to humans exposed to high concentrations. In 1986, a C02 leak killed nearly 1,800 people instantly in Lake Nyos, Cameroon. The leak was but a tiny fraction of the amount of C02 we would need to store annually from coal plants...  Who pays if sequestered carbon leaks and causes fatalities or other damages? Even proponents of CCS have said the technology won't go ahead unless the federal government assumes full liability. If that happens, our tax dollars would be spent protecting utility companies from bearing both the risk and the cost of coal...  Currently, CCS remains a 'smoke and mirrors' show - keeping attention away from real solutions. With global warming accelerating, we need to make smart energy choices now. Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is key to stopping climate change."""
10	Ride-Hailing Apps Such as Uber and Lyft - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Ride-hailing services have a history of poor driver screening that puts passengers at risk. While taxi drivers are subject to rigorous security screening involving fingerprint checks in an FBI database, ride-hailing drivers are only subject to limited background checks. [30] A 2016 lawsuit brought by the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco revealed that 25 drivers with serious criminal records, such as murder and kidnapping, had passed Uber's background checks. [31][32] San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, who sued Uber for allegedly failing to protect consumers from fraud and harm, said of the company's security screening process that does not include fingerprinting, ""It is completely worthless."" [33][34] A report from CNN found that over 100 Uber drivers have been accused of sexual assault or abuse of passengers. [35] One woman wrote in an open letter from 14 victims of sexual harassment and rape by Uber drivers, ""Although I immediately reported what happened to Uber, shockingly, this predator continues to drive for Uber to this day. I am 21 years old and will have to live with this the rest of my life.""

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	"Drone strikes violate the sovereignty of other countries. Strikes are often carried out without the permission and against the objection of the target countries. Pakistan's foreign ministry on June 4, 2012 called drone strikes ""illegal"" and said they violated the country’s sovereignty. [70] On Oct. 22, 2013, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that the ""use of drones is not only a continued violation of our territorial integrity but also detrimental to our resolve at efforts in eliminating terrorism from our country... I would therefore stress the need for an end to drone attacks."" [71] The United Nations' Human Rights Chief, [72] Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, [73] and Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions [74] have all called US drone strikes a violation of sovereignty, and have pressed for investigations into the legality of the attacks.

10	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""Behind the facade of a regulated industry, brothel prostitutes in Nevada are captive in conditions analogous to slavery. Women often are procured for the brothels from other areas by pimps who dump them at the house in order to collect the referral fee. Women report working in shifts commonly as long as 12 hours, even when ill, menstruating or pregnant, with no right to refuse a customer who has requested them or to refuse the sexual act for which he has paid... And, contrary to the common claim that the brothel will protect women from the dangerous, crazy clients on the streets, rapes and assaults by customers are covered up by the management."""

10	Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?	"""Our national and economic security depend on requiring people who are living and working here illegally to come forward and get right with the law. There will be no special path to citizenship for individuals who broke our nation’s immigration laws – that would be unfair to those immigrants who have played by the rules and harmful to promoting the rule of law. Rather, these persons could live legally and without fear in the U.S., but only if they were willing to admit their culpability, pass rigorous background checks, pay significant fines and back taxes, develop proficiency in English and American civics, and be able to support themselves and their families (without access to public benefits). Criminal aliens, gang members, and sex offenders and those who do not meet the above requirements will not be eligible for this program. Finally, none of this can happen before specific enforcement triggers have been implemented to fulfill our promise to the American people that from here on, our immigration laws will indeed be enforced."""
01	Is the United States a Monotheistic (One God) State?	"""[I]t seems clear that generalized governmental endorsements of monotheism are consistent with the Establishment Clause.

01	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""The justice's [Antonin Scalia's] impassioned dissent in McCreary County v. the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky is a revealing portrait of the historical revisionism at the heart of the Christian conservative campaign to convince Americans that the separation of church and state is nothing more than a lie of the secularist left.  The marvel of America's founders, even though nearly all of the new nation's citizens were not only Christian but Protestant, was that they possessed the foresight to avoid establishing a Christian or religious government and instead chose to create the first secular government in the world...  Regardless of the framers' private beliefs about God, it is more important to look at their public actions in crafting the legal foundation for the new republic... And here the right-wing script goes awry, for it cannot explain why, if the founders intended to base the government on Christianity or monotheism, they failed to spell out their intentions in the Constitution itself. There was certainly ample precedent for doing so, not only in the Articles of Confederation but in nearly every state constitution.  Custom, rather than law, is the basis of the most common arguments for breaching the wall between church and state... Handed a tabula rasa [something in its original pure state] by a public uneducated in civics, right-wing revisionists are free to ignore not only the strong anticlerical views of so many of the nation's first leaders but also their loathing of all entanglements between religion and government."""

10	Is a Potential Negative Impact on the Athlete's Health a Valid Reason to Ban Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports?	"""Athletes are in a position to make a decision about what behavior is in their best interest, to weigh the risks and benefits according to their own values. And a paternalistic rule that attempts to prevent the athlete from harming himself runs counter to the important values of independence and personal choice. Moreover, it is likely that the feared harm is neither life-threatening nor irreversible. Presumably, under this health rationale, if performance is enhanced by substances that cause neither short-term nor long-term harm to the athlete, these substances should not be banned."""
10	Would Allowing Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Decrease Fan Turnout, Revenue, and Corporate Sponsorship?	"""In the N.F.L., where there is no test for human-growth hormone and players are as big as buildings, attendance is soaring. We have not come close to determining the extent of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Yet, despite the disclosures and innuendo, fans are flocking to baseball games in record numbers. Where's the outrage? There is none...  I'm not saying that fans don't care. I think they do, but not passionately enough to stay away from the ballpark, perhaps in some noble recognition that the game is larger than the individual, even one who trespasses. These allegations represent an assault on the public trust. But the pull of the home team is much stronger than indignation over a scourge that we don’t truly comprehend. Fan sensibilities have not been offended as much as they've been anesthetized."""
01	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Depression, Bipolar Disorders, Anxiety, and Similar Mood Disorders?	patients have found the mood altering effects of marijuana to be helpful for treating mood disorders such as anxiety, depression and bipolar (manic-depressive) illness. Using marijuana to treat mood disorders was described in medical writings in the 19th and early 20th centuries… The mental component of the pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) often causes psychological problems and is now technically classified as an atypical (not typical) depression. Many women report benefit from using marijuana to improve the symptoms of PMS.”
01	Is Life in Prison without Parole a Better Option Than the Death Penalty?	"""What makes the risk of wrongful execution all the more unacceptable is that there is an effective alternative to burning the life out of human beings in the name of public safety. That alternative is just as permanent, at least as great a deterrent and - for those who are so inclined - far less expensive than the exhaustive legal appeals required in capital cases.   That alternative is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. No 'minimums' or 'maximums.' No time off for good behavior. No chance of release by a parole board, ever. Not even the possibility of clemency. It is, in practical effect, a sentence of death in incarceration.   Life without parole is achievable immediately. The Legislature could enact it Monday. I would sign the measure Tuesday. It would apply to crimes committed the next day. In fact, the only thing preventing the next cop killer from spending every day of the rest of his life in jail is the politics of death."""
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“For women and men across the country, this [minimum wage] raise is long overdue. Congress hasn’t passed a wage increase for more than a decade. The bill the House is likely to vote on this week, the Raise the Wage Act, would increase the hourly minimum gradually from $7.25 to $15 in 2024. Passing this legislation would mean that millions of women will get a necessary raise. Many work hard every day performing services that are essential to our communities and our society, and yet they earn so little that they still worry about paying their bills. We’re talking, for example, about the more than half a million childcare workers whose typical pay is just $11.17 per hour. And we’re talking about the nearly 800,000 home health aides whose median pay is $11.63. The overwhelming share of individuals doing the life-supporting, honorable, and extremely challenging work of caring for our children, people with disabilities, and seniors are women. These types of female-dominated, low-paid jobs are in the fields with the largest projected growth over the next decade. Meanwhile, Wall Street employees, who are predominantly male, made an average of $422,500 (over $200 per hour) in 2017.”
10	"Should the Term ""Illegal Alien"" Be Used to Define Persons in Violation of Immigration Law?"	"""In response to constituent requests, the Policy and Standards Division of the Library of Congress, which maintains Library of Congress Subject Headings, has thoroughly examined and discussed the status of the headings Aliens and Illegal aliens. PSD has determined that the heading Aliens should be revised to Noncitizens. The heading Illegal aliens will be cancelled and replaced by two headings, Noncitizens and Unauthorized immigration, which may be assigned together to describe resources about people who are in a country illegally...   The phrase illegal aliens has taken on a pejorative tone in recent years, and in response, some institutions have determined that they will cease to use it. For example, in April 2014 the Associated Press announced that illegal would not be used as a descriptor for any individual...   After deliberation, the meeting participants determined that the heading Aliens will be revised to Noncitizens. For Illegal aliens, the meeting decided that a heading referring to the act of residing in a place without authorization should be used rather than a heading that describes the people as illegal or unauthorized. For resources about people who reside in a country without authorization, two headings will be assigned, Noncitizens and Unauthorized immigration."""
01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""We believe that rather than drive doping underground, use of drugs should be permitted under medical supervision... The boundary between the therapeutic and ergogenic - ie, performance enhancing - use of drugs is blurred at present and poses difficult questions for the controlling bodies of antidoping practice and for sports doctors. The antidoping rules often lead to complicated and costly administrative and medical follow-up to ascertain whether drugs taken by athletes are legitimate therapeutic agents or illicit...  Furthermore, legalisation of doping, we believe, would encourage more sensible, informed use of drugs in amateur sport, leading to an overall decline in the rate of health problems associated with doping. Finally, by allowing medically supervised doping, the drugs used could be assessed for a clearer view of what is dangerous and what is not."""

An Easter egg slipped into a voting program would never be detected. If the Easter egg allowed a voter to modify the votes inside the machine, it could change the whole election."""
01	Is the ACLU Good for America?	from attacking religious liberty, the ACLU is the premier organization in this country working to preserve religious liberty. It does this by making sure that no religious beliefs get mixed up with government in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. The United States was not founded as a Christian country. Many of the founders were deists who had good knowledge of the persecution (mostly by Christians against other Christians) that can occur when religion gets mixed up in government. They wanted the U.S. government to be secular and totally neutral with respect to religion, hence the First Amendment. The ACLU works hard to maintain that separation of church and state.”

10	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""[B]ecause the level of dairy product consumption in the United States is among the highest in the world, accounting for 72% of dietary calcium intake, and osteoporosis and fracture rates are simultaneously high, numerous researchers have called into question the effectiveness of nutrition policies aimed at osteoporosis prevention through dairy consumption...  Dietary protein, including that from dairy products, influences calcium balance. An adequate protein intake is important for supporting bone growth in children and maintaining bone mass in older adults. However, increasing intake of dietary protein, particularly animal protein, is associated with increased urinary calcium losses that may result in increased bone resorption or increased fracture... Approximately 6mg of dietary calcium is theoretically required to offset the urinary calcium loss associated with 1g of protein.  Dairy products may contain up to 20% of the recommended dietary allowance for sodium per serving. Sodium is an important determinant of urinary calcium excretion because the 2 minerals compete for resorption in the renal tubules. For every 2300 mg of sodium excreted by the kidney, 40 to 60 mg of calcium also are lost...  Currently available evidence does not support nutritional guidelines focused specifically on increasing milk or other dairy product intake for promoting child and adolescent bone mineralization."""

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“When we ask student councils about the issues of concern to them, this often comes up. It’s even more of a concern in mixed schools where, every day, girls see their male classmates come to school in trousers… Some girls really, really hate – absolutely hate – to wear skirts. It is a dated system. In any other walk of life, we wouldn’t dream of telling girls that they have to wear a skirt. So why is it acceptable to inflict it on them at school? …We’ve seen situations in coeducational schools whereby the girls are allowed to dye their hair a natural colour, but the boys are not allowed at all. How a young person appears makes no difference whatsoever to their education… Schools should be encouraging free thought and self-expression, not suppressing it.”

Let's name it and turn the 'Palestinian entity' into a state, and then we can enter into the stormy border negotiations. A political horizon and the two-state solution are both possible and achievable…  Israeli recognition of Palestinian statehood will tangibly advance the two-state vision and will eliminate the dangerous one-state vision that extremists on the right and the left are advancing, among us and among the Palestinians. We have to be honest with ourselves. There is simply no option beyond a two-state solution that will preserve the Zionist dream. One state would be the end of the Zionist dream and it would eliminate the dream of the Palestinians to have a state of their own. With this, we would doom ourselves to perpetual conflict, a lose-lose situation."""
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Contraception can fail. The best plans do not always work out. And when that happens, abortion is an essential part of health care. Abortion allows women to plan and space their pregnancies, which improves their physical, psychological and economic well-being. Evidence shows that people who are able to obtain an abortion are better able to maintain a positive future outlook and achieve their aspirational life plans. Conversely, evidence clearly demonstrates that if a pregnant person seeks an abortion and access to that care is delayed or denied, they are at greater risk of experiencing adverse health and economic outcomes… For people with certain health conditions, an unintended pregnancy can be devastating, if not dangerous. And even with a planned pregnancy, unexpected tragedies can arise. Imagine the woman who gets a cancer diagnosis and must decide between continuing the pregnancy or life-saving chemotherapy. And what about the parents who discover in the second trimester that the fetus has severe anomalies and has no chance of living outside the womb? Abortion is essential health care for them… Abortion is health care. It is life-saving. And when it is needed, it must be accessible.”
01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Childhood obesity is indeed associated with bodily abnormalities and failures to function properly. Some but not all cases of childhood obesity are characterized by increased tendency towards tissue-specific resistance to the actions of insulin, increased mechanical stress on joints, and impaired cardiovascular function. These may manifest as abnormal glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, varying degrees of hypertension, orthopedic complications, and the presence of early atherogenesis. Importantly, childhood obesity is commonly associated with a reduced quality of life and impaired social functioning of the child. Thus, obesity in childhood or adulthood fulfills the dictionary definition of a disease to its fullest. According to the US National Center for Health Statistics, a chronic disease is one lasting 3 months or more, cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medications, nor does it just disappear. In addition, a disease can be considered as a chronic if it is an illness persisting for a long time or constantly recurring. Thus childhood obesity is not simply a disease; rather it is a chronic disease.”
01	Is Obesity a Disease?	"Government entities and major medical groups recognize obesity as a disease. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Obesity Society, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) have identified obesity as a disease. [50][46][47] Even the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recognizes obesity as a disease so weight loss expenses may be counted as a medical deduction from taxes.

10	Should States Issue Driver’s Licenses to Immigrants in the United States Illegally?	"""We are all the descendants of immigrants, and I certainly support legal immigration, but by issuing documents that legitimize the presence of those who have come into our country illegally, we cannot verify the criminal histories of these individuals, or their health histories. In addition, I fear that although it is stated that these licenses cannot be used for the purpose of voting, that there are not enough safeguards to prevent it from being abused in such a fashion…   This program has caused a tremendous increase in lines at the DMV and as public policy it is ill-advised and unworkable."""
01	Is Legal Prostitution a Part of Sexual Liberation?	"""Everybody is entitled to her or his definition of sexuality, and there is nothing wrong with holding the view that sexuality and romance should go hand in hand. However, when a dominant group forces its version of sexual ideology on the marginalized group, it becomes a sexual oppression. A common example of this is homophobia. It is no wonder that gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans people have historically been persecuted in so-called 'vice sweeps' along with prostitutes, or that lesbians and female sex workers were lumped together as 'sinful women' and put in concentration camps during the Nazi era, once we realize that the oppression against sex workers is tightly linked to the oppression against other sexual minorities. It should be self evident which side progressive activists should stand on."""
01	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Social media is not always an online distraction or procrastination platform. While some may be addicted to their social media networks, it is one of the best ways to stay informed. Major news outlets, corporations and persons of interest use social media to deliver messages to the masses. With items posting immediately, the public stays informed. Some issues cause controversy, but social media does more good than harm in retrospect… Although some parents see social media as detrimental to their children, it actually does them some good to have social media accounts. Teens want to be aware and informed just as much as adults. Using social media allows teens to follow organizations and causes that they believe in. It makes them feel like they are a part of something, even when they feel like an outcast in society. Increased teen awareness is important. Social media is one of the best outlets to reach the minds of young people to make a real difference… When natural disaster strikes and causes devastating destruction, social media is the ideal vehicle to deliver messages asking for support. Hashtags are created to help Internet users locate related stories and show their support for those affected by the disaster. This helps stories that begin locally to gain national or global attention.”

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?	"""[T]he factual basis for the Illinois moratorium is even more suspect. Governor Ryan claims that, more than half the time, Illinois capital defendants were actually innocent: twelve men executed; thirteen freed. But in reality there have been 247 death-sentenced defendants in Illinois, not just 25. Of the thirteen 'innocents,' five were acquitted on retrials -- which means not that they were really innocent, but that they were not proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. In the other eight cases, prosecutors dismissed charges without a retrial because of evidence problems. Only one of the thirteen has been clearly established as innocent.  Questions about the Illinois moratorium, however, obscure a more fundamental problem with the moratorium movement: we already have a moratorium, in fact hundreds of them, in each and every death penalty case.  Every capital verdict is held up for years, often for decades, while the case is studied and restudied and studied again in the courts, in all its individual detail. The only defendants who would benefit from a general moratorium are those whose appeals have been rejected every time -- in other words, the capital murderers who least deserve more years of delay."""

"""Electricity is needed to give us light, to power our appliances, to power our televisions and computers, and to enable all of the work saving gadgets that we own. In order to meet these fundamental needs, we will need ever more energy, especially in the emerging economies of the world. This again translates to a very rapid growth in global energy demand, especially the demand for electricity. In the U.S. alone, electricity demand is expected to double by mid-century...  The large growth in global energy demand can only be met by relying on all of our energy resources. No single energy resource can meet such requirements. If we are to avoid energy shortages, we need to greatly expand our use of fossil fuels, nuclear energy, renewables and conservation."""

10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“People carrying hidden, loaded handguns in public create unnecessary risks of intentional or accidental shootings. Carrying concealed weapons (‘CCW’) increases the risk that everyday disagreements will escalate into shootouts, especially in places where disputes frequently occur – in bars, at sporting events, and in traffic. Permissive concealed carry laws violate the shared expectation that public places will be safe environments free from guns and gun violence… Handgun carrying bans were among the earliest gun laws adopted by states; even legendary Old West frontier towns like Dodge City, Kansas, knew better than to allow the carrying of hidden pistols.”

These results suggest that genetic factors may provide an important influence on sexual orientation. The concordance rate for nonheterosexual sexual orientation in monozygotic twins found in this sample (31.6%) is similar to that found in the one previous general population twin study but lower than the approximately 50% concordance rates found in the two previous studies that ascertained twin pairs through homophilic publications.”

10	Does a Person's Race Affect the Likelihood of Him/Her Receiving the Death Penalty?	"""The issue of racial bias is one that has been extensively studied. The most important finding that we see in state after state, including studies sponsored by the defense side or done by defense-oriented researchers, is an absence of any discernible bias on the race of the perpetrator. This is the kind of bias that is of greatest concern because it is the only kind that indicates anyone is on death row because of his race. Absence of such an effect is a great accomplishment and one that should be celebrated. Yet when studies are announced, that finding is typically buried in the fine print…  Research we have to date does not prove or even raise a reasonable suspicion that race is a significant factor in either the charging decision or the sentencing decision in California capital cases. Further research can be done, but if any research is commissioned by the government, we should be very careful that the results will be properly analyzed and not distorted to serve a predetermined agenda."""

01	Does Obamacare Fund Abortion Services for Cases Other Than Rape, Incest, or to Save the Life of the Mother? - DEBATED	"""Despite repeated claims by President Obama and other supporters that the ACA would not promote abortion, the [Government Accountability Office] report identified over a thousand health plans eligible for federal premium subsidies that cover elective abortions. On five state exchanges, every plan covers such abortions in 2014; in another three large states, 95 to 98 percent of the plans do so. The Act's alleged requirements regulating abortion coverage do not exist or are widely ignored. Many health plans do not inform enrollees about their inclusion of abortion coverage; they do not tell them how much they are being charged for such coverage; and they do not charge a 'separate payment' for abortions that is distinct from the premium payment eligible for federal tax subsidies. While state insurance departments are supposedly tasked by the federal government with ensuring that these health plans maintain segregated accounts for abortion funds to keep them separate from federal funds, the report indicates that this is not taking place."""

According to my calculations based on USDA data released last month, the average cup of milk in the United States would not be expected to contain more than a single drop of pus. As the dairy industry points out, the accumulation of pus is a natural part of an animal's defense system. So pus itself isn't a bad thing, we just may not want to have it in our mouth...   The U.S. dairy industry, however, insists that there is no food safety risk. If the udders of our factory-farmed dairy cows are inflamed and infected, industry folks say, it doesn't matter, because we pasteurize - the pus gets cooked.

01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	There has been no rise in the rate of brain cancers despite a massive increase in the use of cell phones. If cell phones were causing cancer we could expect a significant rise in the rate of brain and other related cancers. According to the National Cancer Institute, there was no increase in the incidence of brain or other nervous system cancers between the years 1987 and 2005 despite the fact that cell phone use dramatically increased during those same years. [6] Between 2004 and 2010 there was still no significant change in the incidence rate of brain tumors. Between 2004 and 2010 there was a slight increase from 209 cases to 221.8 cases per 100,000 people, but this slight increase was attributed to better tracking and recording of cases. [43] During the same time period, cell phone use increased 62.7% from 182,140,362 subscribers in 2004 to 296,285,629 in 2010. [44] Read More
10	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""[T]here is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide.

The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion…  [L]ast year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty.

"""It has been my clinical experience that many women get relief of symptoms such as menstrual cramps, heavy bleeding, breast pain, and endometriosis pain when they stop consuming dairy foods. This is not true for everyone, but it works often enough to be worth a try. Though it's not clear why dairy foods seem to be associated with women's pelvic symptoms, I have a few theories. One possible explanation is that most milk today is produced by cows treated with BGH (bovine growth hormone)... Both hormone and antibiotic residues in the milk may stimulate the female hormonal system in some way we are not yet able to pinpoint...  Some women equate menstrual cramps and PMS, but PMS is different from menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). This difference is not always clearly stated in writings on PMS. Many women with PMS have completely pain-free periods. Many women with severe cramping have no premenstrual distress...

01	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""Corn and soybeans may be the current 'go-to' crops for producing ethanol and biodiesel, respectively. But two other crops—switchgrass and hybrid poplar—could steal the show in the future when it comes to curbing greenhouse gases, according to Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and collaborating scientists.  In a study published in the April issue of Ecological Applications, ARS scientist Paul Adler and colleagues compared the net production of carbon dioxide and two other greenhouse gases associated with producing biofuels from several different bioenergy crops.  In short, it takes energy to produce energy...For example, operating a tractor to plow, plant, fertilize and harvest all require gasoline or diesel fuel. This, in turn, releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases tied to global climate change.  The good news? Bioenergy crops offset their greenhouse-gas contributions in three key ways: by removing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it in crop roots and soil as organic carbon; by producing coproducts like protein for animal feed, which saves on energy to make feed by other means; and by displacement, whereby replacing a fossil fuel with a biobased one 'recycles' rather than adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.  Together with ARS scientist Stephen Del Grosso of Fort Collins, Colo., and William Parton of Colorado State University, Adler predicted a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if ethanol and biodiesel from corn-soybean rotations were used instead of gasoline and diesel. This reduction was about two times greater than using ethanol produced from corn grain alone."""

In the absence of tenure, teachers may be fired for any reason. Teachers may be fired if the principal doesn’t like them or if they are experienced and become too expensive. Teachers may be fired for being outspoken. There is no evidence that tenure causes low test scores. There is no evidence that children get higher achievement if their teachers have no tenure. The best predictor of low test scores is poverty. Every standardized test — whether the SAT, the ACT, state tests, national tests, or international tests – shows the effects of family income on test scores… The loss of tenure will make it even more difficult to staff schools in the poorest neighborhoods. Abolishing tenure solves no problems for students and creates massive demoralization among teachers, who understand that their job depends now on compliance to administrators, at whose whim they serve.”
01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Harrow’s distinctive uniform is not simply an exercise in conformity, but a connection to the rich history of the school and a symbol of its distinguished community… These elements make boys feel that they belong to something bigger than themselves. The simple act of putting on a uniform makes every day an occasion, and indicates a readiness for the day ahead… But boys at Harrow do not wear uniform simply for the sake of tradition, to feel they belong, or even to prepare them mentally to study. Like so many things at Harrow, our uniform is a great leveller. No two Harrovians are the same: some live in London, others much further afield in the UK or overseas; a number come from established Harrow families, others have no experience of public schooling; many excel in sport or the arts, while others are incredibly strong academically. Whatever they bring to the Hill, they all come together on equal footing, to be identified and judged by their character and contribution alone.”

That settled understanding has informed the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence and is entitled to respect...  [T]he reference to God in the Pledge is not reasonably and objectively understood as endorsing or coercing individuals into silent assent to any particular religious doctrine. Rather, the Pledge is 'consistent with the proposition that government may not communicate an endorsement of religious belief,' because the reference to God acknowledges the undeniable historical facts that the Nation was founded by individuals who believed in God, that the Constitution's protection of individual rights and autonomy reflects those religious convictions, and that the Nation continues as a matter of demographic and cultural fact to be 'a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.'"""

Another issue that often arises is the use of flavored milks that provide the same nutrient package as regular milk. Unflavored milk is lower in sugar than flavored milk.

I’m also aware of the extraordinary racial disproportionately and racism that has permeated this war on marijuana and the broader war on drugs for all too long. Ask why was marijuana criminalized in the first place?… There was not medical evidence being provided. There was no National Academy of Science saying that marijuana prohibition would be a better policy than marijuana legalization and regulation.

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription drug ads encourage people to seek medical advice from health professionals. 64% of physicians surveyed in Apr. 2013 agreed that DTC ads encourage patients to contact a health professional. [42] A 2010 Prevention Magazine survey reported that 29 million patients talked to their doctors about a medical condition after seeing DTC prescription drug ads and most discussed behavioral and lifestyle changes; over half of those patients received non-prescription or generic drugs rather than the brand-name prescription drug seen in the ad, meaning that talking to the doctor was the real benefit. [32] Patients with lower incomes and education levels who are less likely to seek medical care in general were more likely to see a doctor after seeing DTC prescription drug ads. [44] A 2005 Journal of Family Practice article found that 83% of prescription drug print ads focused on patient-physician communication and 76% promoted dialogue with health care professionals. [40] According to a 2004 FDA survey, 77% of people said DTC ads increased awareness of new drugs and 58% thought the ads gave enough information to help them decide whether to speak to a doctor.

Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other illicit drugs over the years. It went up mildly in the 1990's, and has since either dropped off slightly, or leveled off since 2000. It's likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than what's happening in the sports pages. In fact, a study released last year (344 KB) , and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids, found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen's own self, self esteem and body image. The suggestion, and I think we can all agree it's pretty intuitive, is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or Mark McGwire, but because they want to look good for teenage girls."""

10	Does the Death Penalty Cost Less Than Life in Prison without Parole?	"""The resources that go into a death penalty case are enormous. The pursuit of execution adds millions at each phase of the process, from trial, to appeal, and habeas proceedings. For example, a death penalty trial costs counties at least $1.1 million more than a conventional murder trial. The state spends at least an additional $117 million a year on capital punishment, about half of it on prison expenses that exceed the usual costs of housing inmates and the rest on arguing and judging death penalty appeals.  The costs mount because death penalty trials and appeals take far longer than others, involve more lawyers, investigators and expert witnesses, and displace other cases from courtrooms. In contrast, adopting a maximum penalty of life without possibility of parole (for which there is growing sentiment) would incur only a fraction of the death penalty costs, including prison expenses."""

Lennie Jarratt, Project Manager for School Reform at the Heartland Institute, stated, ""free markets offer a much better way to hold educational institutions accountable for their failures. Under this model, inadequate schools lose money or are forced to close after consistently failing to perform… Why should we reward terrible schools with an indefinite stream of tax dollars?""

A thorough and unbiased closer look, however, reveals that obesity is, in fact, not a disease at all. First of all, many of the medical conditions, including mortality, associated with obesity are actually a result of sedentary lifestyle and poor food choices… Second, a significant source of decreased health on the body is cyclical weight-loss dieting and fad diets… In contrast, increased mobility through mild but maintainable activity, in combination with improved food choices, decreases stress and increases health and energy, whether or not actual weight is lost.”

But once these plants are set up and running, they have lower operation and maintenance costs than conventional power on a yearly basis. No more regular fuel bills and only minimal expenses for upkeep of solar, for example, which has no movable parts that wear out and need to be replaced.   The price argument is also fallacious because we have never paid the real price for the power we use, which includes the cost to the environment and human health of the carbon pollution that fossil-fuel mining and burning generates...

Nor did they work in prostitution any more: they were employees in the 'sex industry.' Presumably, orgasms are now a consumer product just like any other. As for pimps, the correct term is probably: 'brief sexual liaison coordinators.'   The editors who decided on the new terminology almost certainly felt, and probably still do feel, a warm glow of self-satisfaction (one of the few emotions than never lets you down). How they must have prided themselves on their broadmindedness, as they strove to reduce the small-minded stigma traditionally attached to offering sexual services in return for money! How morally brave and daring they must have felt, to fly so boldly in the face of two millennia of unthinking condemnation!...   The idea of the state coercing its population into prostitution is, of course, repellent. Even the most liberal of liberals would probably agree with that. This means that there is after all a moral difference between prostitution and washing dishes in the local restaurant or stacking supermarket shelves. And that prostitution is both age-old and ineradicable does not make it any less degrading to all concerned."""
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“The interactive nature of video games is vastly different than passively listening to music, watching a movie, or reading a book. With interactive video games, the child becomes a part of the action which serves as a potent agent to facilitate violence and over time learns the destructive behavior. This immersion results in a more powerful experience and potentially dangerous learned behavior in children and youth… Just as the technology of video games improves at astonishing rates, so to does the body of research consistently demonstrate the harmful effects these violent interactive games have on minors. Over three thousand peer-reviewed studies, produced over a period of 30 years documenting the effects of screen violence (including violent video games), have now been published… These data suggest very strongly that participating in the playing of violent video games by children and youth increase aggressive thought and behavior; increase antisocial behavior and delinquency; engender poor school performance; desensitize the game player to violence.”

Denying licensed individuals the means to defend themselves on college campuses turns institutions of higher learning into supermarkets for would-be rapists and mass murderers. Current state laws and school policies prohibit licensed, law-abiding citizens from carrying concealed handguns onto college campuses, while doing nothing to disarm individuals not concerned with following the rules. These laws and policies hand armed madmen, like the Virginia Tech and NIU killers, virtual cornucopias of defenseless victims.

But communities would plunge into anarchy if they could not act on moral assumptions less certain than that the sun will rise in the east and set in the west.  Abolitionists may contend that the death penalty is inherently immoral because governments should never take human life, no matter what the provocation. But that is an article of faith, not of fact, just like the opposite position held by abolitionist detractors, including myself...  The death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill; it does not treat him as an animal with no moral sense, and thus subject even to butchery to satiate human gluttony. Moreover, capital punishment celebrates the dignity of the humans whose lives were ended by the defendant's predation."""

10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Obesity itself cannot be considered an illness. The most common cause is caloric intake that is persistently higher than caloric output. Reimbursement may not be made for treatment of obesity alone since this treatment cannot be considered reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. However, although obesity is not in itself an illness, it may be caused by illnesses such as hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease, and hypothalamic lesions. In addition, obesity can aggravate many cardiac and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, services related to the treatment of obesity could be covered services when such services are an integral and necessary part of a course of treatment for one of these illnesses.”
01	Should Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Extended to People Who Are Not Terminally Ill?	"""Should people with mental illness be denied assisted death?

But there is an important proviso: All people who request assisted death should be competent. What that means, practically, is that they have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, to make decisions rationally…  We should not discriminate or deny people rights because it makes us queasy or because of our prejudices… But we're not talking about granting assisted death to someone who is delusional, or suffering from psychosis or someone who is depressed and treatable.

10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“Some of you know that I graduated from college rather swiftly (in just 2 1/2 years)… The information I garnered during those 2 1/2 years hasn’t been useful to me even once during the many years since I graduated, and there isn’t a single contact I made in college that was beneficial to me in any way at all. Simply stated, I could have gone straight from high school to work without any difference. Centuries ago, the only reason the tiny percentage of people who attended university did so was in order to join the clergy. These days, the rather substantial percentage of those going to ‘college’… have very different reasons for going: namely (1) because their parents or society expects them to do so in order to get a ‘good’ job; (2) to garner useful contacts, particularly if one is attending an elite school. I was accepted into ‘elite’ schools… but I chose instead to go to a more middle-of-the-road school. I suspect if I had gone to a brand-name school, I would have indeed garnered valuable contacts, but frankly, I did all right without them.”

10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“[A]s a disease, obesity is a flawed construct. Consider, for a moment, some of the awkward questions that arise when you call obesity a disease: is someone who is slightly overweight, only slightly diseased? Can someone catch or ‘come down’ with obesity? Can obesity really be ‘cured’? If these questions seem ludicrous, it is because obesity does not readily meet the criteria of disease. According to Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, a disease is ‘an interruption, cessation, or disorder of body function, system, or organ.’ By this definition, if obesity is a disease, then we must assume that, at some level, body fat is pathological. Yet… there is no clear evidence about what level or even how, exactly, adipose tissue is harmful to our health. For some extremely heavy people, their body fat may disrupt their ability to function, particularly their ability to exercise, but for most people their fatness is not a disorder. Indeed, body fat on some parts of the body, such as the thighs, can actually be helpful to sustaining our health. Even Stedman’s Medical Dictionary does not call obesity a disease; it is simply known as ‘excess subcutaneous fat in proportion to lean body mass’ or, at worst, ‘a public health problem.'”
10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“[T]the administration’s excessive use of drone attacks undercuts one of its most laudable policies: a promising new post-9/11 approach to the use of lethal American force, one of multilateralism, transparency and narrow focus… From Pakistan to Yemen to post-American Iraq, drones often spark deep resentment where they operate. When they do attack, they kill as brutally as any weapon of war. The administration’s practice of classifying the strikes as secret only exacerbates local anger and suspicion. Under Obama, drone strikes have become too frequent, too unilateral, and too much associated with the heavy-handed use of American power.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Modern society depends on always available power. If power goes down then society stops. There are no phones, no internet, no ATMs, no refrigeration, no sewage pumps – nothing, and if a large city like London is without power for more than 12 hours rioting and looting would quickly take hold. It is therefore inconceivable not to ensure that we have reliable energy at all times. So an energy plan for the UK must be able to meet demand even on the coldest evening of the year in winter with no wind and no solar. For this reason Renewable energy can never under any realistic scenario meet that target. To imagine that battery prices could fall enough to make wind and solar backup such enormous power demands is simply a delusion."""

10	Does the Death Penalty Cost Less Than Life in Prison without Parole?	"""Our research has revealed that $4 billion of state and federal taxpayer money has been expended administering the death penalty in California since 1978, with a cost in 2009 of approximately $184 million above what taxpayers would have spent without the death penalty… These totals do not include the additional funds the state is poised to spend to maintain the current broken system...  In cases in which a defendant faces a maximum penalty of life without the possibility of parole, rather than the death penalty, there is no penalty phase trial at all. Thus, the government would not incur these costly expenditures if the death penalty were abolished…  The costs associated with death penalty trials that took place between 1983 and 2006 averaged about $1 million more per trial than the costs of average non–death penalty homicide trials. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that there are several significant, easily identifiable costs incurred in every death penalty trial that are not incurred in non–death penalty homicide."""

10	Should insider trading by Congress be allowed?	"""When discussing decisions that fall into moral and legal gray areas, I often ask my students: How would this look on the front page of the New York Times? If the answer is 'terrible,' then my advice is simple: don't do it. I think it's clear that insider trading by members of Congress does not pass this test. The fundamental principle underlying laws on insider trading is the notion that financial markets should be a fair and even playing field, not one where certain huge titans have unreasonable advantages over the widows and orphans. While we all know that the reality of financial markets is far less benign, this is not a good reason to abandon the principle altogether. We don't give up on speed limits because many people routinely ignore them...  Similarly, the argument that we shouldn't bother legislating against insider trading by Congress because it would be impossible to enforce is worrisome. If we applied that principle to all laws, we would be veering toward anarchy. Moreover, as the Historical Timeline suggests, insider trading is difficult but not impossible to enforce. Indeed, the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission] and NYSE [New York Stock Exchange] have developed sophisticated technology to spot insider traders...  Finally, it is worth noting that public scorn of Congress has never been lower. The public trusts its congressional representatives less than it does used car salesmen; less than 20 percent of the American people approved of the job Congress was doing in September 2008. This distrust is firmly rooted in both the perception and the reality of congressional antics over the past decade or so. Surely congressional representatives have ample opportunity to enrich themselves after they leave office; they should not require the benefit of insider trading to do so while they are serving at the will of their people.  The principle of a fair playing field is and should remain sacred (tarnished though it may be). There's no excuse for abandoning it."""
01	Would Improving Palliative Care Decrease Patient Requests for Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""It is the general consensus of the AGS [American Geriatrics Society] that most individuals who consider PAS [physician-assisted suicide] or VAE [voluntary active euthanasia] do so out of fear of the dying process. The vast majority of patients can be comfortable (which might require sedation) and potentially could find meaning in the last phase of life and choose to forgo a life-sustaining treatment and accelerate dying. All of these options for care, are already legal. Most would choose to live if they had full confidence that the care system would serve them well.

In addition to vote totals, DREs can print out each individual ballot (without identifying the voter) to provide an additional security and audit capacity. Not only can this data be printed, it is saved electronically in multiple formats in multiple locations, so that if one mechanism fails, the information is backed up using another format in another location. In other words, DREs in well-administered systems provide a substantial audit capacity for purposes of recounts and authentication."""

01	Does the Use of Illegal Performance Enhancing Drugs by Some Athletes Coerce Other Athletes to Also Use Them to Remain Competitive?	"""The pressure to use exists when people believe that something confers a competitive advantage, whether or not this is objectively true. There is, then, an inherent coerciveness present in these situations: when some choose to do what gives them a competitive edge, others will be pressed to do likewise, or resign themselves to either accepting a competitive disadvantage or leaving the endeavor entirely...   Unquestionably, coerciveness operates in the case of performance-enhancing drugs and sport. Where improved performance can be measured in fractions of inches, pounds, or seconds, and that fraction is the difference between winning and losing, it is very difficult for athletes to forego using something that they believe improves their competitor's performance... Under such pressure, decisions to take performance-enhancing drugs are anything but purely 'individual' choices."""

There are many ways we can work toward this ultimate goal and items we can hope to accomplish in the near term. I strongly oppose any federal funding of abortion and will attempt to stop the flow of tax dollars to groups who perform or advocate for abortion… I would strongly support legislation restricting federal courts from hearing cases like Roe v.

The sex industry appears to be no different. All developed economies have conceded that the business is impossible to stamp out. Tolerating prostitution while leaving it technically illegal or semi-legal encourages corruption: policemen are paid to turn a blind eye. It also renders the workers helpless against their employers. Until recently, sex slaves who escaped from brothels in most European countries were usually deported as illegal aliens, which hardly helped the authorities nail their oppressors. The inexorable trend, in both law and public morals, is towards legalisation of what is already tolerated.   That would free law-enforcers to concentrate on what is not tolerated, such as the sexual exploitation of children. And it would put the greater part of the sex business where it ultimately belongs - as just another branch of the global entertainment industry."""

"""It might seem intuitive that when there is an increase in the supply of workers, the ones who were here already will make less money or lose their jobs. Immigrants [documented and undocumented] don't just increase the supply of labor, though; they simultaneously increase demand for it, using the wages they earn to rent apartments, eat food, get haircuts, buy cellphones. That means there are more jobs building apartments, selling food, giving haircuts and dispatching the trucks that move those phones. Immigrants increase the size of the overall population, which means they increase the size of the economy. Logically, if immigrants were 'stealing' jobs, so would every young person leaving school and entering the job market; countries should become poorer as they get larger.

True, there are health benefits for some patients. Several recent studies, including a new one from the Scripps Research Institute, show that THC, the chemical in marijuana responsible for the high, can help slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. (In fact, it seems to block the formation of disease-causing plaques better than several mainstream drugs.) Other studies have shown THC to be a very effective antinausea treatment for people — cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, for example — for whom conventional medications aren’t working. And medical cannabis has shown promise relieving pain in patients with multiple sclerosis and reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients… Frequent marijuana use can seriously affect your short-term memory. It can impair your cognitive ability (why do you think people call it dope?) and lead to long-lasting depression or anxiety. While many people smoke marijuana to relax, it can have the opposite effect on frequent users. And smoking anything, whether it’s tobacco or marijuana, can seriously damage your lung tissue… Despite all the talk about the medical benefits of marijuana, smoking the stuff is not going to do your health any good.” [Editor’s Note: Sanjay Gupta was categorized as con medical marijuana until he made a pro statement on Aug. 8, 2013, found in the pro column on the left side of this page.]

This is not surprising, since there would be no way to detect a ballot data error without paper ballots.  In response to the warnings of computer experts, many election officials have claimed that their security procedures guard against vulnerabilities.

01	Should the US Congress Be Involved in Setting Drug Policies for Professional Sports?	"""When the House Government Reform Committee recently called baseball stars and league officials to testify about steroid use, critics complained that Congress and the federal government should not get involved in sports, even regarding drug use. These critics were off the mark.  First, the federal government already has a role in this issue. It is a federal crime to possess and distribute steroids and certain other performance-enhancing drugs...  Second, the federal government already has a moral and statutory responsibility to educate young people about the dangers of illegal drug use, including steroids...  Third, critics of federal involvement erroneously portray sports as somehow different. In fact, sports, especially Major League Baseball and the other pro leagues, are big businesses...  In business terms, use of steroids has essentially cooked the recordbooks of these companies. If such fraud and abuse occurred in any other market sector, there would be no question federal involvement is appropriate. There should be none here. Moreover, the sports leagues enjoy substantial federal benefits under law, including a vital antitrust exemption. In the other sectors, such as broadcasting, where special privileges are granted by the federal government, companies are subject to public responsibilities and federal oversight.  Fourth, some critics have the simply wrongheaded idea that the unique nature of sports makes impossible a positive federal role in fixing this problem. Overwhelmingly in other nations, professional sports leagues are subject to independent drug testing and enforcement agencies that are, one way or another, governmental or quasi-governmental bodies. For example, sports-crazed Australia operates the Australian Sports Drug Agency, one of the world's finest programs...  [G]iven the problems professional baseball faces in this scandal, the league might well consider federal help as something like a relief pitcher coming in late in the game to rescue it from a very costly loss."""

01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	Cheating by teachers and administrators on standardized tests is rare, and not a reason to stop testing America’s children. The Mar. 2011 USA Today investigation of scoring anomalies in six states and Washington DC was inconclusive, and found compelling suggestions of impropriety in only one school. [118] The US Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said on Jan. 7, 2013 that an investigation had found no evidence of widespread cheating on the DC Comprehensive Assessment System tests. [156] It is likely that some cheating occurs, but some people cheat on their tax returns also, and the solution is not to abolish taxation. [152] Read More
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“IIHS’s first study in 1974 looked at two states and one Canadian province that lowered the drinking age, carefully comparing their experience to that of adjacent states that did not change. That study showed that the number of 15-20 year-olds involved in fatal crashes increased in the jurisdictions that lowered the drinking age. Subsequently, in the late 1970s, states began to increase drinking ages again. Again, it was possible to compare states that made this change to states that didn’t. Again, we saw a change related to the drinking age — this time, fatal crash rates declined as teen drinking and teen drinking and driving declined. Although there’s variation the effects are consistent: deaths go up when the drinking age is lowered and they go down when it is raised. The 21-year-old drinking age is saving lives… Lowering the legal age to purchase and consume alcohol to 18 would increase the number of 18-20 year-olds killed or injured in motor vehicle crashes. Others too would die in crashes involving drinking teenagers.”
10	Are the Laboratories Used to Test Athletes for Performance Enhancing Drugs Credible and Reliable?	"""From the beginning, the Laboratoire National de Dépistage et du Dopage ('LNDD') has not been trustworthy. In this case, at every stage of testing it failed to comply with the procedures and methods for testing required by the International Standards for Laboratories...  It was disclosed during the hearing that the [WADA] Laboratory Directors are bound by an Ethics Code of Conduct [see below] that has been interpreted to preclude them from disclosing the errors of one of their fellow laboratories on behalf of an athlete. In other words, if a Laboratory Director knew that another laboratory had made an error and that error was causing an innocent athlete to be convicted of a doping offense, they could not testify on behalf of the athlete and disclose the error...   While this provision does not expressly preclude a Laboratory Director from testifying on behalf of athletes, the testimony of the Laboratory directors made it clear that is in fact how the provision has been interpreted and enforced.  When you have flaws that are as obvious as the flaws in LNDD's document package in this case and you combine that with the fact that actions were taken on Mr. Landis' sample that are not recorded, then I do not see how you can state with confidence what happened to those samples at any particular time. Flaws of this magnitude in the internal chain of custody renders any results from tests done on those samples unreliable.""  [Editor's Note:  The Ethics Code of Conduct referenced by Campbell above is written in the International Standard for Laboratories (450 KB) and states the following:  ""The Laboratory personnel shall not engage in conduct or activities that undermine or are detrimental to the anti-doping program of WADA, an International Federation, a National Anti-Doping Organization, a National Olympic Committee, a Major Event Organization Committee, or the International Olympic Committee. Such conduct could include, but is not limited to, conviction for fraud, embezzlement, perjury, etc., that would cast doubt on the integrity of the anti-doping program.""]"

01	Should People Have a Right to Become Prostitutes?	"""[T]he most important argument for the legalization of prostitution services is that such prohibitions violate one's most basic and inherent rights. Prostitution is the voluntary sale (or rental) of a labor service. Individuals own their own bodies and their own labor services and have the absolute right to decide how those labor services should be used. As long as the prostitution transaction is voluntary, there is no justification for governmental interference. Indeed, such interference constitutes an infringement of the privacy and personal liberty of the individuals involved."""
10	Are Felon Disenfranchisement Laws a Form of Racial Discrimination?	"""It is true that the Supreme Court has upheld congressional bans on certain voting practices and procedures - like literacy tests - that are not themselves discriminatory on their face but have disproportionately excluded racial minorities from voting. But, as the Court later stressed, these cases involved bans aimed at practices that historically have been rooted in intentional discrimination. The disenfranchisement of criminals, on the other hand, has no such roots.   Indeed, Section 2 of the 14th Amendment itself contemplates this disenfranchisement, since it acknowledges that 'the right to vote' may be 'abridged...for participation in rebellion, or other crime....' Surely this is some evidence that the reasons for disenfranchising criminals need not be racially discriminatory...   The fact that an overwhelming number of states have passed such disenfranchisement laws also indicates that something other than racial discrimination is indeed the motive."""

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 do not necessarily cause global warming, which contradicts the core thesis of human-caused climate change. Earth's climate record shows that warming has preceded, not followed, a rise in CO2. According to a 2003 study published in Science, measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years), periods of natural global warming preceded global increases in CO2. [117] In 2010 the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published a study of the earth's climate 460-445 million years ago which found that an intense period of glaciation, not warming, occurred when CO2 levels were 5 times higher than they are today.

01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“What good would lowering the drinking age do? It would put an end to the perverse culture of secretiveness and abuse that has grown up around underage drinking. It would allow bars and restaurants to become ‘safe spaces’ for college-age students to drink and Uber home if they need to. Proponents will undoubtedly also emphasize the revenue gains for the state that would come from legalization. But the longer-term gains would be cultural. We could begin to foster a more European-style culture of drinking that promotes responsibility and civilized sobriety. People are more likely to act like adults if you treat them as adults. Prohibition has promoted a horrible childishness with terrible results for everyone… No, lowering the drinking age would not create utopia, and it does introduce a different set of problems. The difference is that these problems can be dealt with in the same way that society deals with other problems: family, education, cultural change, liability, and institutional supervision. Society can’t even begin to deal with the problems of youth drinking as long as it exists in dark, hidden corners. The national drinking age has had terrible consequences. As with Prohibition, it’s time we admit it and move on, into the light.”

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Raising the minimum wage right now is more important than ever. Minimum wage increases stimulate the economy by increasing consumer spending, without adding to state and federal budget deficits. Consumer spending drives 70 percent of the economy, and increasing demand is key for jumpstarting production and re-hiring. A raise in the minimum wage puts money into the pockets of low-income consumers, who immediately spend it at local businesses… Strengthening the minimum wage can help build a sustainable economic recovery – without increasing costs for taxpayers… [S]ix of the top ten growth occupations projected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for next decade are low-wage jobs, including home health aides, customer service representatives, food preparation and service workers, personal and home care aides, retail salespersons, and office clerks. Raising the minimum wage would boost pay scales in these types of jobs where millions of Americans today spend their careers… Research has documented how, especially in low-wage industries, raising wages reduces turnover, because workers who are paid more stay with their current employer longer.”

10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“[C]utting taxes doesn’t necessarily mean that companies will create jobs – they could just hold onto the extra cash or distribute the profits to shareholders and those at the top… [L]owering the corporate tax rate alone won’t necessarily make any difference – there are plenty of other things that shape where companies choose where to locate – an educated workforce, a robust regulatory regime, and access to capital among them. Second, it’s entirely possible that companies can move somewhere for a low tax rate and still create little economic activity and few jobs there. Third, lowering taxes can lead to a race to the bottom in which many countries compete to lower their taxes… Indeed, the U.S. would see dramatically lower revenues if it lowered its corporate tax rate.”

We must diversify the available supply of conventional fuels and expand production around the world and here at home– including within a small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and portions of America's Outer Continental Shelf – in an environmentally sensitive and efficient manner.

10	Can Marijuana Use Cause Death?	used in medicine are routinely given what is called an LD-50. The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage 50% of test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced toxicity… At present it is estimated that marijuana’s LD-50 is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman terms this means in order to induce death, a smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette. NIDA-supplied [National Institute of Drug Abuse] marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately 0.9 grams.

Now more than ever there are some major highs and really depressing lows, and they come so close together. So you begin to feel numb to genuine emotion… I think a lot of relationships have been ruined by one person’s addiction to social media, whether that addiction leads to a connection with a past love or crush—and that can be detrimental—or sometimes it simply means that you get home at night to spend time with your significant other and you have nothing to talk about because you’ve spoken about everything all day through social media or you’ve looked through each other’s social media feeds.

On both moral and Halachic [Jewish legal] grounds it is wrong to take one or two verses in the Bible, stripped of their historic context and devoid of medical knowledge, and apply them to punish innocent people who cannot deny their basic instincts, impulses and sexual attractions. To inflict punishment upon the innocent violates the spirit and intent of Jewish law.”
10	Is Legal Prostitution a Legitimate Business?	"""We've become accustomed to thinking of prostitution as a legitimate way of earning a living, even 'empowering' for women. We call it 'sex work' and look away. We should not.   For the last three years I've been investigating prostitution worldwide to test the conventional wisdom of it being a career choice, as valid as any other. I conducted 250 interviews in 40 countries, interviewed 50 survivors of the sex trade, and almost all of them told me the same story: don't believe the 'happy hooker' myth you see on TV. In almost every case it's actually slavery...  I discovered that whatever the lobbyists say, women and girls in prostitution are overwhelmingly from abusive backgrounds, living in poverty, and otherwise marginalised. They are not free or empowered: they are abused and trapped. Let's not forget that this goes for boys too."""

For example, only a few vegetables (such as spinach, collard greens, and broccoli) are calcium-rich; most other vegetables (including such favorites as potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, corn, and carrots) are not. In addition, the calcium in dairy products is better absorbed from the digestive tract than the calcium from some other sources...

10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""We were promised that Obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. We were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. We were promised that Obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. Instead, the law brought the American people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. We were let down.  This year alone, Obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. Individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. Under the two most popular Obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median American household income. This is not affordable.  Obama's promise of 'choice' has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. No one can deny Obamacare is in a 'death spiral' when the number of Americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year. This is not choice."""
10	Would Legal Prostitution Decrease Sexually Transmitted Diseases?	"""A legalized system of prostitution that mandates health checks and certification only for women and not for clients is blatantly discriminatory to women.

It is argued that legalized brothels or other controlled prostitution establishments protect women through enforceable condom policies. In one of CATW's studies, U.S. women in prostitution interviewed reported the following: 47% stated that men expected sex without a condom; 73% reported that men offered to pay more for sex without a condom; 45% of women said they were abused if they insisted that men use condoms. Some women said that certain establishments may have rules that men wear condoms but, in reality, men still try to have sex without them.

10	Is it legal for Congressional representatives to trade securities based on insider information?	"""[It is] an urban myth that Congress has somehow exempted itself from a federal statute that outlaws insider trading by all those outside of the Capitol. Indeed, while the current catalyst is 60 Minutes’ recent claim that congressional insider trading is ‘perfectly legal,’ a similar hullabaloo occurred more than a year ago after the Wall Street Journal asserted that legislative staffers could legally profit from the use of congressional knowledge because Congress was purportedly ‘immune from insider-trading laws.’  Congress in no way has sought to immunize or exempt itself. Beyond that, my article concluded then, and I continue to say with confidence now, that congressional insider trading is already illegal under existing law. Based on my research, I would expect a federal district court to hold Members of Congress and legislative staffers liable for any securities trading that is based on material nonpublic information obtained through congressional service, if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a civil case, or the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a criminal case, successfully proved the facts alleged. I acknowledge, however, that many distinguished securities law scholars and at least one such scholar has concluded that ‘the quirks of the relevant laws almost certainly would prevent Members of Congress from being successfully prosecuted.’”"

At the center of the distinction between killing and allowing to die is the difference between physical causality and moral culpability. On the one hand, to bring the life of another to an end by an injection is to directly kill the other--our action is the physical cause of death. On the other hand, to allow someone to die from a disease we cannot cure (and that we did not cause) is to permit the disease to act as the cause of death."""
01	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""In a VVAT system, the correctness of the software no longer matters. Either it consistently produces paper ballots that match voters' intent, or it is taken out of service.  An important benefit of VVAT over paperless DRE systems is the ability to audit the election. VVAT paper ballots are collected and stored in traditional ballot boxes such that they can be counted to determine the final election tallies. Because they were printed by computers, they can be read by other computers using optical character recognition (OCR) tools. They can likewise be read by human, if for whatever reason the electronic counts are considered unreliable. The VVAT ballots may also contain cryptographic security measures, perhaps printed as a bar-code, to provide protection against ballot stuffing attacks.  Certainly, the notion of having independent records of important data is not an idea unique to voting. Our banking industry, despite all of their computers, generates huge amounts of paper. Every ATM prints a receipt for its transactions. Credit card transactions likewise generate paper receipts. Furthermore, banks send every customer a printed statement at the end of the month. The existence of these redundant records allows for inconsistencies and fraud, which occur on a regular basis, to be detected and corrected. VVAT provides this same level of assurance to our election systems."""

The NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) has indicated that it expects to receive applications for the construction and operation of as many as 34 new plants by 2010. Not all these applications will be filed and no doubt not all the filed applications will result in new plants. But there is the prospect of significant new nuclear construction in the US.

Other biomass resources show, at best, very low net energy recovery...  The two most popularly suggested energy alternatives, wind and solar, suffer because they're undependable, intermittent sources of energy, and the end product is electricity. We have no way to store large amounts of electricity for use when wind and sunshine are not with us. Geothermal and tidal energy are insignificant energy sources in total but can be locally important. Nuclear energy can be a large power source if the safety aspects can be guaranteed (and this may be possible) -- but again, the end product is electricity. There is no battery pack even remotely in sight that would supply the energy needed to effectively power bulldozers, heavy agricultural equipment such as tractors and combines, or 18-wheelers hauling freight cross-country.  Can electricity be used to obtain hydrogen as a fuel from water? It can, but hydrogen is difficult to store and dangerous to handle. And there is no energy system now visualized to replace kerosene jet fuel, which propels a Boeing 747 about 600 miles an hour nonstop on the 14-hour trip from New York to Capetown (currently the longest plane flight).

Rather than obstruct the enforcement of federal law, law enforcement should work cooperatively with the federal government to ensure a uniform system of law that protects public safety…   Sanctuary and other non-cooperation policies are harmful as they exacerbate national security threats, encourage illegal immigration, waste law enforcement and other taxpayer funded resources, and most importantly, put the public at risk by allowing known criminal aliens to be released back onto the streets.

10	Has Obamacare Worsened the Primary Care Physician Shortage? - DEBATED	"""Most earlier analyses assumed that the primary care physician supply is currently fully utilized, so that new demand would require new resources to maintain access to care. But newer research demonstrates that the intensity of health service use varies considerably across the United States...  Our analysis indicates that the ACA is expected to result in roughly 20.3 million additional primary care visits nationally, with people newly insured through the marketplaces accounting for more than a third of these visits, or about 3.8 percent above base...  The U.S. health system is likely to be able to absorb these increases. Use of primary, emergency, inpatient, and outpatient care varies substantially across the country, and these variations do not appear to be correlated with delays in access to care. The variation in use patterns supports the idea that anticipated increases in doctor's visits by the newly insured can be accommodated through organizational changes and changes in practice patterns...  It is critical that the expansion of health insurance coverage leads to improved access to care for those who were previously uninsured and does not limit access for those who already have coverage. Our results suggest that the current supply of primary care physicians and physicians in most specialties is sufficient to ensure this result will hold."""

01	Is Sexual Orientation Determined at Birth?	saying that sexuality is set in stone from birth is also not quite right, the main emphasis of those using the choice argument is that homosexuals have weighed up their options and consciously decided ‘I am going to be gay from now on’. Assuming this is true (which it clearly isn’t), WHY would they do this? If we’re being generous, we could say the choice claim assumes that people have no sexual orientation up to the point where they choose one. And some people choose homosexuality. Presumably this is some time during adolescence when sexual maturity really kicks in, and you know what teenagers are like. Is choosing homosexuality just another example of a desire to not conform, like shaving your head or wearing outlandish clothes? The trouble with this claim is that teenage rebellion is largely temporary; hair grows back, outfits can be changed. But those who ‘choose’ homosexuality really seem to stick with it. So maybe it’s a ‘lifestyle’ thing, as many claim? This suggests that those who are about to choose their sexual orientation look at the consequences of homosexuality and think it’s a better option. They see the oppression, the suicide rates, the discrimination and harassment, the inequality, the increased risk of mental health issues, or abandonment from your family; they see all this and think ‘I gotta get me some of that’? This seems, to put it mildly, unlikely.”

Every five-year-old can appreciate wearing a school uniform is a powerful rite of passage, and an equally powerful statement of belonging. This is no less true of high school students. Quite frankly, we spend far too much time pandering to a generation for whom individuality is a temper tantrum and a Facebook post short of an overblown sense of entitlement. We need to spend more time emphasising the value of community, and how communities can only function if everyone gives up some of their own entitlement for the good of others.”

The decline in executive clemency has been well documented (and lamented) and the explanation for it is quite simple: self-interest...  In short, the area of capital clemency is the site of a total diffusion of responsibility.  The Court will not regulate the clemency process because it is a matter for the executive and some governors will not grant clemency because the execution process belongs entirely to the courts.  All the while, the use of capital punishment continues to increase, the deregulation of the death penalty continues, and the Supreme Court continues to proclaim executive clemency as the fail safe of the criminal justice system."""

Studies done so far, however, have not provided convincing evidence that marijuana benefits people with MS. In another study smoking marijuana was shown to worsen control of posture and balance in 10 people with MS and 10 who did not have MS. It is the opinion of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s Medical Advisory Board that marijuana is not recommended as a treatment for MS. Long-term use of marijuana may be associated with significant serious side effects. In addition, other well-tested FDA-approved drugs are available, such as baclofen and tizanidine, to reduce spasticity in MS.”
01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“Same-sex couples are similarly situated to different-sex couples in terms of their economic status, their family decisions, their interdependence, and their valuing of marriage. It’s no surprise, then, that gay couples eagerly take advantage of the right to marry when they have it. Research shows that couples who marry – gay or straight – want to express their commitment to each other and to their family and friends. Same-sex couples want to marry to create a firm personal and legal foundation for their own lives and security for their current and future children. Gay couples need access to civil marriage for the same reason that heterosexual couples need it: only the law can create a family relationship between adults that will be recognized by the state and third parties, like employers and insurance companies. Gay couples need the cultural status of marriage (not civil unions) because that’s what their friends and family understand and look for. Overall, the evidence suggests that letting same-sex couples marry would be good public policy. Same-sex couples and their families will benefit, and the institution of marriage does not suffer. Gay couples’ interest in marriage is a vote in favor of the ongoing relevance of marriage in today’s world, a change that should strengthen, not weaken, the institution.”

Except for those who were born on American soil, citizenship is not a right. It's a privilege.

10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Marijuana legalization, even if restricted to adults, may be associated with (a) decreased adolescent perception of marijuana’s harmful effects, (b) increased marijuana use among parents and caretakers, and (c) increased adolescent access to marijuana, all of which reliably predict increased rates of adolescent marijuana use and associated problems. Marijuana use during pregnancy, occurring at increasing rates, raises additional concerns regarding future infant, child, and adolescent development… Adolescents are especially vulnerable to marijuana’s many known adverse effects. One in six adolescent marijuana users develops cannabis use disorder, a well characterized syndrome involving tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite significant associated impairments. Selective breeding has increased marijuana’s addictive potency and potential harm to adolescents. Heavy use during adolescence is associated with increased incidence and worsened course of psychotic, mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Furthermore, marijuana’s deleterious effects on adolescent cognition, behavior, and brain development may have immediate and long-term implications, including increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, sexual victimization, academic failure, lasting decline in intelligence measures, psychopathology, addiction, and psychosocial and occupational impairment. Marijuana-related policy changes, including legalization, may have significant unintended consequences for children and adolescents.”
10	Is There an Ethical Difference Between Using Performance Enhancing Drugs and Using Performing Enhancing Technologies in Nutrition, Training, and Equipment?	"""Technological innovations are present in all sports, and at all levels... For example, swimmers are now using full-body suits made out of material that minimizes friction with the water...  Spiked athletic shoes are also standard issue today. These shoes have been proved to reduce times by full seconds by virtue of the better grip, and therefore propulsion, that they afford the athlete. Simply put, if you don't wear them, you are going to lose.  The examples above of swimmers and track athletes are particularly good ones as they both involve sports that have been the traditional bastions of those blowing the anti-doping trumpet the loudest. But isn't this remarkable, as it seems athletes can use any technology (clothes, shoes, heart-rate monitors, etc.) to help them beat their opponent, as long as this technology is put on the outside of the body. Yes, comes the immediate response, but when you take performance enhancers, you are not competing. It is some super-you; you are performing way beyond your natural capacity. People who use this line of argument are simply (and conveniently) omitting the impact of new technology. Don't swimming suits and running spikes do exactly the same thing? Anyone arguing from an 'all athletes need equal footing' perspective is going to have to go the whole way and have us all passing the baton barefoot and naked."""
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	DTC prescription drug ads promote drugs before long-term safety information is known.

[46] 43% of consumers surveyed thought the drug had to be 100% safe before being advertised but not all drugs have completed long-term safety trials before advertising begins. [46] Vioxx was advertised, requested by patients, and prescribed from 1999 to 2004 for arthritis and pain relief before being withdrawn from the market for causing strokes and heart attacks. [46] Vioxx was listed as the primary suspected cause of death in 4,540 mortalities from Jan. 1, 1999 to June 30, 2005. [50] Other drugs like Bextra (for arthritis), Quaalude (a sleeping aid), Cylert (for ADHD), Darvon (for pain relief), and Zelnorm (for irritable bowel syndrome) have been taken off the market for safety concerns after being advertised to the public. [46] Between the 1970s and 2014, at least 35 drugs were pulled from the market, most for safety concerns.

One reason for doubting that they do is that it once again appears as if 'coercion' is being used too broadly. One might just as well say that students who study harder than others 'coerce' their classmates into studying harder too in order to keep up, or that athletes who practice longer hours than others 'coerce' their competitors into practicing longer hours as well. The problem with such claims, of course, is that any competitive pressure becomes 'coercive' in such an extended sense of the term.

What too few people appreciate is that:   1) Adjusted for inflation, the cost of health care per year of life saved has actually been falling; what has been happening is that we are devoting a rising proportion of our resources to health care with resulting large increases in longevity and better health. In other words, we are not paying more for the same level of health care, but somewhat more for a much higher level of health care.   2) We have been able to devote more resources to health care because rising productivity in other areas has freed up those resources…   In short, we shouldn't bemoan the fact that we are spending more and more on health care--we should be grateful that our country's tremendous productivity enables us to spend more and more to save lives and improve health!...   Since its inception, the pro-life movement has fought just as hard to safeguard the lives of the vulnerable elderly and people with disabilities from euthanasia as to protect the lives of the unborn from abortion.

01	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""Biofuels can provide a number of environmental advantages over conventional fossil fuels—most notably a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since the transportation sector accounts for about a third of total U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide (an abundant GHG), cleaner transportation fuels can play an important role in addressing climate change.  The level of GHG emissions associated with a particular biofuel depends on the energy used in growing and harvesting the feedstock, as well as the energy used to produce the fuel (e.g., coal, natural gas, biomass). On a full fuel-cycle basis, corn ethanol has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52% over petroleum-based fuels. Even better, ethanol made from cellulosic feedstocks, such as switchgrass, or agricultural residues such as corn stover, has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 86%, compared to gasoline.  Biofuels have the added benefit of providing a 'carbon sink.' As crops grow to produce the feedstocks for making the biofuel, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."""

01	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""We know nuclear energy is safe, clean and effective because, right now, 137 nuclear re-actors are generating more than one-third of Western Europe's electricity and 440 in all are supplying one-seventh of the world's [electricity]...  Radiation is part of our natural environment and we can live with it. All of us are exposed to natural radioactivity every minute, mostly from rocks and soil. The radiation bombarding us goes up 10 percent when we sleep next to another human. A weekend at a beach with granite rocks in Brittany or Cornwall increases it three-fold, a skiing holiday ten-fold.  How do nuclear power stations compare? The radiation from a reactor is tiny: about as much as that from our own bodies. According to the UK's National Radiation Protection Board, doses from the entire nuclear industry amount to less than one percent of our total exposure. Medical uses such as X-rays account for 14 percent and the remainder is natural. Compared with known cancer risks such as smoking and poor diet, it reports, the risk from non-medical, man-made radiation is about 1/100th of one percent...  The fall-out from the radioactive cloud [from Chernobyl] that swept Western Europe was really nothing: only one-tenth of a chest x-ray or ten days on holiday in the Alps...  A Swiss study of deaths related to power generation came up with astonishing results. Nuclear turns out to be five times safer than oil, ten times safer than gas and 100 times safer than hydro-electric dams. According to the World Health Organisation, worldwide fossil-fuel pollution is responsible for three million deaths a year."""
01	Do Studies Conducted on Homosexuality in Twins Show a Genetic Basis of Sexual Orientation?	conservatives often point to studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and raised independently. If one is gay, then the other twin is found to be gay only about 55% of the time. They reason that: since identical twins have the same genetic structure, then if homosexual orientation were determined by genes, 100% of the other twins would be gay… [This is] based upon a faulty or inadequate knowledge of the detailed workings of genetics. Genes have a property called penetrance, which is a measure of their effectiveness, or power… The penetrance of the gene which causes Type 1 (early onset) diabetes is only 30%. So, if one identical twin has the allele that causes diabetes, then the other twin will have the same allele. Both will have a 30% chance of developing the disorder. Both twins will have the same genetic structure. But it may or may not be triggered by something in the environment, and cause diabetes. If one identical twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has about a 48% chance of also developing the disorder. If one twin develops bipolar affective disorder, (formerly called manic depression) the other twin’s chances are about 60% of having it as well… We do not wish to imply that homosexuality is a disease. We are merely suggesting that the root cause of many diseases – and traits like left-handedness – are genetic. Most human sexuality researchers who are not religious conservatives regard homosexual orientation as a trait like left-handedness.”

It doubled as a terrific employment program- not for Saddam’s victims in Iraq, but Saddam’s Baath Party and the United Nations... In the end, the most alarming aspect of Oil-for-Food is not that it became the biggest financial scandal ever to bubble through the U.N., but that it was the natural product of a U.N. steeped for decades in its own culture of privilege, immunities and secrecy, accustomed to guarding the interests of despots at the expense of subjugated peoples, and- as Oil-for-Food so richly exemplified- more absorbed in its own venal interests, payrolls and power than in such matters as the world peace, freedom and prosperity it was founded to promote."""

01	Is a College Education Worth It?	“Yes, a college education is certainly ‘worth it’ to the many students for whom college is a way out of cyclical poverty or geographic isolation… The value of college as a way to access new opportunities cannot be underestimated. …The inherent value of learning aside, the current reality is that a high school education leaves many young Americans unemployable and unprepared to meet future challenges. Students graduate without the communication, collaboration, and analysis skills that will help them be successful. To succeed in the antiquated structure of many public schools, students have to shut off their technology, separate what they are learning into the often arbitrary silos of discrete courses, and succeed at reproducing answers obtained through rote learning. These strategies are especially detrimental in the sciences, where mastery occurs through hands-on experimentation and problem solving. All too often, college is the first time that students have the opportunity to learn in this way.”
01	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?

Statistics show the estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. account for 13.6 percent of all offenders sentenced for crimes committed in the U.S. Twelve percent of murder sentences, 20 percent of kidnapping sentences and 16 percent of drug trafficking sentences are meted out to illegal immigrants."""

01	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“[S]ocial media is a counterweight to the ongoing devaluation of human lives. Social media’s rapid rise is a loud, desperate, emerging attempt by people everywhere to connect with *each other* in the face of all the obstacles that modernity imposes on our lives: suburbanization that isolates us from each other, long working-hours and commutes that are required to make ends meet, the global migration that scatters families across the globe, the military-industrial-consumption machine that drives so many key decisions, and, last but not least, the television – the ultimate alienation machine… From Arab Spring dissidents who were minorities in their communities to my students from a variety of backgrounds, from gay teens in rural areas to just people who feel awkward when in company of new people, I’ve heard the sentiment again and again that new communication tools are what saved their (offline) social lives… Can’t be close to your family because your job took you to the other end of the planet? You can still share updates on Facebook. Your government is censoring news of your protest? You can tweet photos of it.

10	Are DACA and the DREAM Act Good for America?	"""But the real problem with DACA, as with any form of amnesty, is the message it sends to the billions of poor and suffering people from around the world who would give anything to come here. That message says — if you can get here by hook or by crook — sooner or later we will give you legal status, let you stay, so you can then sponsor all your relatives to join you. Amnesties guarantee new, future illegal immigration. There is no disputing that the massive amnesty provided by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) — 2.7 million people were granted legal status — contributed to the greatest wave of illegal immigration in the nation’s history. Since 2012, when the president invented DACA, we have seen unprecedented waves of illegal alien youth — unaccompanied minors — flood the border and receive temporary legal status.  More broadly, any benefit in any form provided to unauthorized immigrants encourages more illegal immigration."""

"""The problem is that medical science has conquered the gentle and peaceful deaths and left the humiliating and agonizing to run their relentless downhill course. The suffering of these individuals is not trivial and it is not addressed by anything medical science has to offer. Faced with this dilemma, the problem for many is that the law turns loving families into criminals. It separates loved ones at the end, when it is most important to be close. It encourages patients to choose violent and premature deaths while they still have the strength to act.

10	Is It Possible to Have a Meaningful Recount from an Electronic Voting Machine?	"""The first issue is, what exactly would be recounted? Clearly a second summation of machine outputs would be meaningless. We would need some record of voter-intent independent of the machines. The obvious source would be paper ballots marked by voters, which could then be hand-counted. Paper ballots printed by DRE (touch-screen) machines will not suffice, since it is well known that most voters do not actually verify the correctness of such printouts. (It is also possible for a machine to void a voter-approved ballot and to substitute a different one after the voter leaves the booth.) So meaningful recounts are possible only for OS (optical scan) systems, which process voter-marked ballots, but not for the substantial percentage of US votes now cast on DRE machines, with or without printers."""
10	Are Living Wills a Good Idea?	"""[A living will is a] rather 'blunt instrument' in end-of-life situations. When we sit down to draft a living will, we suppose that we can foresee, predict or somehow imagine what our particular medical situation will be like in the future, maybe 10 or 20 years down the road. This is clearly an exercise in speculation, and we might actually fare better in the stock market or in Las Vegas than in an exercise of this sort…   There is a better choice available to Christians than a living will. We can choose a surrogate, a living person, who will make health care decisions in real time on our behalf if we are rendered unable to do so. The proposed surrogate (also called a 'health care proxy') is someone who cares deeply about us, who loves us, and is reasonably able to make decisions in accord with our known wishes and with our best medical and spiritual interests in mind. Filling out a form to designate our health care proxy is something that each of us should do as a sensible way to prepare for difficult end-of-life situations that may arise. Preparing such a document can also prompt us to begin discussing these important topics more effectively with our families and loved ones."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""As civil libertarians, we believe the government should not throw consenting adults in jail for private sexual conduct. An adult who chooses to engage in sexual activity, whether for recreation, procreation or in exchange for something of value, makes a private, individual choice that should not be subject to criminal sanctions. Our rights to individual autonomy and privacy allow us all to make these decisions as adults.  As advocates for equality, we know that anti-sex work laws disproportionately target women along with LGBTQ people, young people and people of color, all of whom are overrepresented in the sex industry and at highest risk of arrest. Systemic discrimination can factor into the decision to participate in sex work. In the face of job discrimination, no viable alternatives for earning a living, ejection from school, eviction from housing or ostracism from your family for your gender identity or sexual orientation, sex work may offer one of the more stabilizing and accessible ways to support yourself and your family. As criminal justice reformers, we see laws criminalizing sex work as another way of misdirecting law enforcement resources and expanding our unjust system of mass incarceration. Scarce tax dollars underwrite people's arrests and imprisonment for consensual activity. In addition to criminal records, arrests for sex work come with devastating collateral consequences, including eviction, loss of child custody and deportation."""

In the crisis, all emergency responders used and leveraged social media networks for communicating both with the public and among themselves… In recent years, the social media, and especially Twitter, have emerged as important, near real-time communication channels and technologies during emergency response. Social media consist of tools that enable open and online exchange of information through conversation, interaction and exchange of user generated content… The different social media channels have become an integral tool in the response of official authorities and the general public to emergency situations.”
01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Taxing and regulating marijuana allows for control, which is a far better approach than prohibition for marijuana consumers, workers, communities, and the environment. Only in a regulated system can the government ensure marijuana is tested for dangerous pesticides and contaminants. Regulation also allows for environmental and worker protections: When marijuana is prohibited, it is often grown in environmentally sensitive locations where streams are diverted, toxic waste is left behind, and illegal rodenticides enter the food chain and poison predators — including endangered animals. Relegating marijuana to the illicit market leaves workers vulnerable to sexual assault, wage theft, violence, and felony charges. With regulation, governments control where marijuana is sold, when it is sold, and to whom it is sold. They decide what types of products to allow — and many ban products likely to appeal to minors — and how cannabis must be packaged and labeled. Regulators can also require information be disseminated with cannabis and can fund honest education campaigns to educate marijuana consumers and youth about making healthy decisions. Ending marijuana prohibition also frees up law enforcement resources, allowing police to focus on crimes with victims rather than fighting an unwinnable 80-year-old war against a substance that is safer than alcohol.”
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“I want people to make a lot more than $9… Nine dollars is not enough. The problem is that you can’t do that by mandating it in the minimum wage laws.

10	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""I am going to speak today about the most media-hyped environmental issue of all time, global warming...  The media have missed the big pieces of the puzzle when it comes to the Earth's temperatures and mankind's carbon dioxide (C02) emissions. It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the one degree Fahrenheit temperature increase during the 20th century means we are all doomed. First of all, the one degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the greatest advancement of living standards, life expectancy, food production and human health in the history of our planet. So it is hard to argue that the global warming we experienced in the 20th century was somehow negative or part of a catastrophic trend.  Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have continued to ignore is the fact that the Little Ice Age, which resulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold deaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.  In addition, something that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the theory that C02 has been the driving force in global warming. Alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began warming at the end of the Little Ice Age in about 1850, long before man-made CO2 emissions could have impacted the climate. Then about 1940, just as man-made CO2 emissions rose sharply, the temperatures began a decline that lasted until the 1970's, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice age.  Let me repeat, temperatures got colder after C02 emissions exploded. If C02 is the driving force of global climate change, why do so many in the media ignore the many skeptical scientists who cite these rather obvious inconvenient truths?"""

Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won't commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force."""

10	Does Ethanol Generate More Energy Than the Amount Needed to Produce It?	"""It takes a lot of energy from methane, oil, and coal to produce corn, and even more fossil energy to convert the corn feedstock into ethanol...  When one analyzes the energy inputs to corn production in the U.S., such as fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides, machinery, fuel, irrigation, drying, and transportation, only 3.65 times more energy can be gained from corn than was used to produce it. In other words, to produce from corn the amount of energy equivalent to 3.65 gallons of gasoline, one has to burn 1 gallon of gasoline equivalent in fossil fuels. Conversion of corn to ethanol by fermentation and distillation requires even more fossil energy. In the end, about 2.66 gallons of ethanol are obtained from one bushel of corn. During the corn conversion process, more fossil energy is used, and additional environmental pollution from the waste streams, water, gases and solids, is generated...  [I]n the process of converting industrial corn grain into ethanol, we have lost 65% of the energy inputs. More ominously, we have burned at least as much fossil fuel energy to obtain ethanol, as we may gain by burning it.  In our opinion, at this time the U.S. does not need ethanol from corn or any other plant. If, for example, the unnecessary corn were not planted, and the corn ethanol not produced, the large quantities, nine million gallons of gasoline equivalent per day, of methane, gasoline, diesel fuel and coal would be saved."""

10	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	Economy: Reagan pledged during his 1980 campaign for president to balance the federal budget, but never submitted a balanced budget in his eight years in office. In 1981, the deficit was $79 billion and, in 1986, at the peak of his deficit spending, it stood at $221 billion. The federal debt was $994 billion when he took office in 1981 and grew to $2.9 trillion when his second term ended in 1989. [36] Reagan also added more trade barriers than any other president since Hoover in 1930. US imports that were subject to some form of trade restraint increased from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.

10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Today, there can be no dispute that Obamacare is a disaster.  The reason Obamacare is failing is not its bungled website. It is because Americans are now seeing the fundamental trade-off behind the law — that in order to insure a relatively small number of the uninsured, many millions more Americans are likely to lose their private insurance, lose access to preferred doctors, or pay substantially more for their insurance.  President Obama promised that if this law was passed, you could keep your plan, you could keep your doctors, and your premiums would go down. Each of those promises has proved false.  Already, more than 4 million people have lost their insurance plans because of Obamacare. And millions more Americans' health insurance is at risk. Some experts predict anywhere from 80 million to 129 million private health plans will be canceled or forcibly changed over the next year...  The president promised that the average family's premiums would fall by $2,500; instead, they have risen by over $3,000 since 2008...  Moreover, Obamacare is a major jobs killer, especially for those struggling to climb the economic ladder. Workers are seeing their hours cut, and small businesses are unable to hire new employees."""

We fully appreciate the many pressures and crises which may lead some parents to believe they have no choice but to abort their child. That is why we work to offer abortion-bound mothers and fathers the help they need to overcome their difficult situations and choose life when faced with an untimely pregnancy. However, killing an unborn child is inherently wrong, and therefore can never be justified regardless of circumstances. It is no more just to kill an unborn child in order to avoid hardship than it would be to kill a toddler to avoid hardship. Because the unborn child is unseen, it is easier for society to condone killing him or her, though this is morally indistinguishable from killing any child at any stage of development. In addition, abortion does not solve the deeper problems that have contributed to having an untimely pregnancy—problems such as low self-esteem, sexual exploitation, unchaste sexual behavior, poverty, lack of education and absence of moral guidance. In fact, the negative effects of abortion can actually compound these problems. Finally, a society which allows the killing of its most vulnerable members, in the very place in all the world which should be for them to be safest and most nurtured—their own mothers’ wombs—is incapable of cherishing and nurturing human life or valuing childhood and motherhood.”

01	Ride-Hailing Apps Such as Uber and Lyft - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Ride-hailing apps offer a convenient, safe, and affordable transportation option that is especially useful to take drunk drivers off the road. A full third of ride-hailing passengers who own vehicles (33%) said the main reason they use the service is to avoid drunk driving. [5] Fatal alcohol-related car accidents dropped between 10% and 11.4% after the introduction of ride-hailing services; DUIs went down as much as 9.2% in some cities. [6] Researchers estimate that if ride-hailing were fully implemented across the country, the resulting drop in DUI-related accidents could save 500 lives and $1.3 billion in American taxpayer money annually. [7] The technology used by ride-hailing companies increases reliability and decreases wait times for consumers, and can offer a 20% to 30% discount over the cost of a taxi. [2][7]These apps have built-in safety features, such as displaying the license plate and car model to ensure that riders get into the correct vehicle, the ability to share the route with friends and family, GPS tracking, cash-free transactions, and driver ratings.

Well, you're required to have a health insurance plan. If you don't than you have to eventually pay a fine/fee/penalty... tax of $2,000 per employee. That sounds like a lot. But it's actually not as much as you think. When you dig down in the calculation, you'll see that the first 30 employees are exempt from the tax. And then when you compare the tax to what you're probably now paying for health insurance (which averages between $8,000-$11,000 per employee according to some studies), you may find that not carrying insurance and just paying the tax is way less expensive than carrying the insurance...  Because we're promised lower insurance rates and a state-run competitive exchange of products we may also find ourselves avoiding that annual anxiety attack when we're told how much our rates are going up that year. Theoretically, health insurance, previous subject to 15-20% annual increases, should now be more under control and easier to budget. At least that's what we're told.

People buying marijuana on the street have no way of knowing if what they're ingesting is covered with mold, fungus, pesticides, or other harmful substances. [8][9] Once marijuana is legalized, the government is able to enforce laboratory testing and regulations to ensure that marijuana is free of toxins. [10] For example, Washington law requires health warnings, quality assurance, labeling for the concentration of THC, and other important regulations for consumers. [11] Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska all passed regulations to prevent kids' exposure to marijuana, including child-resistant packaging. [12] Legalization allows the government to set age restrictions on buyers and to license and regulate the entire supply chain of marijuana, including growers, distributors, retailers, and testing laboratories. [13] California regulations include limitations on the serving sizes for edible marijuana products, seed-to-sale testing and tracking, and 24-hour video surveillance at retail stores. [14] Read More

The government today is anti-religious in a whole host of ways. When the Supreme Court discusses religion, it uses words like 'coercive,' 'divisive,' 'danger,' and 'irrational.' In the name of the Bill of Rights, the Court has banned religion from public schools. Yet it is worth noting that the same Congress that passed the Bill of Rights in 1789 also passed a law encouraging the teaching of religion in public schools in Northwest Territories--the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  This hostility toward religion raises an intriguing question: If we refuse to acknowledge that foundation of our principles in 'the laws of nature and of nature's God,' what do our principles rest on?

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“Marriage is a public institution because it brings together men and women for the reproduction of the human race, and keeps them together to raise the children produced by their union. Future generations are fundamental to the survival of society. The quality of their nurture is directly related to the quality of life within society. Bonding the man and woman whose sexual union produces a child to one another and to that child is the most efficient way of insuring that nurture. Opposite-sex relationships are the only type capable of producing children through natural intercourse, and the only ones assured of providing children with both a mother and a father. Affirming only opposite-sex relationships as marriage thus makes perfect sense. Social science has shown that children raised by their own biological mother and father, committed to one another in a lifelong marriage, are happier, healthier, and more prosperous than children in any other households. Does society need children? Do children need a mom and a dad? The answer to both questions is Yes. Legalization of same-sex marriage would amount to a declaration that the answer to both is No. This would be a foolish and tragic choice.”

Yet under the Social Security plan outlined in President Bush’s 2005 State of the Union address, sustaining promised benefits for those age fifty-five and over would require the government to borrow nearly $5 trillion over twenty years… If privatization proposals were adopted, young people would lose in three significant ways: – Reduction of Benefits. The Commission’s privatization proposal would, over the next 47 years, reduce benefit levels by as much as 44 percent below current Social Security benefits, and 28 percent lower than the benefits that would be provided even after the trust funds become depleted. – A Change in How Benefits Are Calculated… This plan would end the policy of linking Social Security benefits to wage growth, a practice that has been in effect since the 1970s… – Performance and Administrative Costs of Private Accounts. Returns on private accounts are not likely to be as high as some privatization advocates predict. Some will do better than the averages quoted and some worse. No matter how the stocks perform, workers who elect to create investment accounts would receive even deeper cuts in their guaranteed benefits in order to pay back the money borrowed to finance the account.”

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“From the first full year that the Constitution’s outline of the gold standard took effect, 1790, until 1913, the year the Federal Reserve came into existence and the serial dismantling of the gold standard began, the United States economy increased in size, in real terms, by just about 150-fold. This record of growth, which amounted to 4.0% year in and year out, was so large, so unprecedented, and so long-lasting, that not only did the United States roar by all other countries in terms of overall output over the course of this extended period, the U.S. economy was over twice as large as its closest rival, Germany… Today, as our nation struggles to get out of a five-year cycle of recession and pseudo-recovery, and as Keynesian remedies make their last, desperate play for relevance and legitimacy, the question of gold has naturally arisen in many quarters… The moment for gold seems to be arriving—and none too soon… There is one conclusion that we are prepared to draw after two long experiences under different monetary regimes that make up this nation’s history. This is that the era of superior macroeconomic performance was that of the gold standard. The runs of growth were larger, more consistent, and accompanied by greater price stability if not gentle deflations proper to an economy making major productivity advances… Growth, stability, suppleness through crises, and few negative side effects: these were the criteria invented in the twentieth century to grade economic performance. The results are in. Gold fulfilled these criteria with flying colors in the long era prior. And as our fiat-money Great Recession lingers after five years, we are correct to judge the entire era of the non-gold American economy to have failed to live up not only to the best standards of economics, but to this great nation’s proven potential.”

Education Secretary Arne Duncan and his wife send their children to Arlington public schools in Virginia. Neither the Arlington Public School system, nor Sidwell [attended by Obama’s children], nor The Lab Schools [attended by Emanuel’s children], assess teachers by student standardized test grades, which is a bad idea sweeping the country, encouraged by the Obama administration.”
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The only possible peaceful solution is one of two-states for two nations based on the exchange of 'refugees for settlers.' This would enable the formation of two relatively, even if not perfectly, nationally congruent states...  Moreover, the key aspiration of both Palestinians and Israelis is national independence. This is the basic quest of both the Zionist and the Palestinian national movements and the Jewish Israeli and the Palestinian peoples. Thus, the two-state solution can meet the key aspiration even if not meeting additional secondary desires (such as the control over the whole area between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River).  Further, two-states for the two nations is the most effective way of minimizing state-to-nation imbalances. Partition resolves the 'nation without state' and the stateless refugees problem for the Palestinian imbalance, while producing a clear-cut Jewish majority state in Israel instead of the unstable and imbalanced de-facto bi-national situation."""
10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Pasteurization kills or slows the growth of pathogens and microbes and it must be accomplished according to state standards under sanitary conditions. The process involves the heating of milk to a high temperature for a specific time and then cooling it immediately. The manufacture and sale of unpasteurized [raw] milk products poses a risk of pathogenic contamination. Those pathogens include salmonella, listeria, e-coli, staphylococcus aureus and tuberculosis."""
01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	"Standardized tests are inclusive and non-discriminatory because they ensure content is equivalent for all students. Former Washington, DC, schools chancellor Michelle Rhee argues that using alternate tests for minorities or exempting children with disabilities would be unfair to those students: ""You can't separate them, and to try to do so creates two, unequal systems, one with accountability and one without it. This is a civil rights issue."" [103] Read More"
01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	Small churches, already struggling to survive, would be further endangered by a new tax burden. A 2010 survey by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research found that congregations facing financial strain more than doubled to almost 20% in the past decade, with 5% of congregations unlikely to recover. [22] If these churches were obliged to pay taxes, their existence would be threatened and government would thus be impeding religious expression. [20] Read More
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	MLDA 21 exerts valuable social pressure on potential underage drinkers and those who may serve them. Youth may choose not to drink, or to drink less often, because of decreased social acceptability or increased risks from parental or legal authorities. Older youth and adults may furnish alcoholic beverages to minors less frequently, and licensed alcohol outlets may sell to minors less frequently, because of their perceptions that it is illegal, morally wrong, or because they might be caught.

10	Do Athletes Gain an Unfair Advantage by Using Performance Enhancing Drugs?	"""Many of us share the intuition that use of performance enhancers provides an unfair advantage, but we need to ask whether this intuition can be supported by good arguments... One line of argument suggests an analogy with differences in the equipment available to competitors. For example, if one player in a golf tournament used golf balls that flew significantly further than balls used by opponents even when struck with the same force, the tournament arguably is unfair. One player is able to avoid one of the major challenges of golf not because of skill but simply because of use of a superior product. Perhaps the use of steroids provides a similar unfair advantage.  The problem with this line of argument, however, is that it is at best unclear that the golf tournament is unfair. If the ball is legal and available to other competitors, the user indeed has an advantage over players using ordinary equipment, but what makes the advantage unfair?...[T]here are all sorts of differences in equipment, background, training facilities, coaching, and diet that can affect the performances of athletes but are not regarded as unfair. Until we can say why the advantages provided by such performance enhancers as steroids are illegitimate, and advantages provided by other differences in background conditions are legitimate, the charge of unfairness must be dismissed as lacking adequate support."""
10	Is It Possible to Have a Meaningful Recount from an Electronic Voting Machine?	"""While HAVA requires that all voting systems produce a paper record in order to provide a manual audit capacity, the paper record of a DRE is interpreted by voting machine vendors and some election officials to refer to an end-of-day printout of either the totals or the ballot images...  Computer experts point out that if a DRE makes errors in recording or storing votes, its end-of-day printouts will be incorrect and no meaningful audit can be done. When a machine produces results a second time, it's merely a reprint, not a recount."""
01	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""There is strong indication from the interview, document analysis, and ethnographic data presented here that legal brothels generally offer a safer working environment than their illegal counterparts. Regulated brothels offer particular ways of dealing with pragmatic safety issues and minimizing actual violence... Nevada brothels offer specific mechanisms to protect workers via the ways transactions are organized, the ways technology is ordered, the visibility of customers, the bureaucratic relationships among customers, managers, and workers, and the cooperation with police based on the mere fact of their legality. All of these mechanisms work to eliminate systematic violence and to discourage an atmosphere of danger and risk."""
10	Should Steroid Use Be Accepted in Sports?	"""I would argue that prohibition [of steroids] is justified because (1) steroid use makes little sense if everyone uses; gains are minimal and everyone is exposed to the risks, (2) how your body reacts to a steroid is not an athletic talent like running or hitting, and (3) it's worth protecting the ideal of sport as a healthy pursuit. Critics might reply that it is better to give people choices, but I would give greater weight to protecting the idea of sport as a healthy pursuit where the rules make sense when applied to everyone and that we focus on athletic ability, not how one's body reacts to a drug."""
10	Should Fighting Be Allowed in Hockey? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Fighting at the professional level sets a bad example for kids. Even though fighting in youth leagues is banned, young hockey players have constantly tried to imitate the tactics used by professionals, both legal and illegal. [25] The damaging physical effects of fighting are even more significant for young players, since their brains are not fully developed. For younger players, concussions can cause permanent learning and cognitive disabilities, many of which may not be recognized until they grow up. [26] Young hockey players are already susceptible to catastrophic spinal cord and brain injury, at nearly four times the rate of young football players. [27] Dr. Michael Cusimano, a neurosurgeon, said, ""Whatever is done at a professional level in sports is emulated almost immediately by children who idolize their heroes. NHL players also have to be aware of this and set a better example for our kids."" [28] Most of what players are trying to accomplish through fighting can be done by having the referees call more penalties during the game, which sends a better message to kids about conflict resolution.

01	Did the Oil-for-Food program benefit the people of Iraq?	"""The United Nations Oil-for-Food program was authorized by Security Council Resolution 986 in April 1995 and became operational in December 1996. The Security Council had imposed comprehensive multilateral sanctions on Iraq in August 1990 (UNSCR 661) to convince Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait without the use of force. Sanctions on Iraq continued after the Gulf War and were thought by many in the international community to impose extreme hardship on the Iraqi people. The Oil-for-Food program was created to alleviate those hardships. It allowed the import of humanitarian goods using the proceeds from controlled Iraqi oil sales while maintaining sanctions on imports other than food and medicine. The objective was to continue constraining Saddam Hussein's ability to use oil revenue to build a military arsenal... The Oil-for-Food program represented the largest humanitarian relief operation ever launched by the international community. Iraqi oil exports totaled over $64.2 billion over the life of the program. The proceeds funded $46 billion worth of humanitarian contracts for Iraq, and $16 billion for the UN Compensation Commission, as well as administrative costs for the Office of the Iraq Program, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, and the UN Special Commission totaling $2.65 billion. Of the $46 billion funding for humanitarian contracts, more than $31 billion in humanitarian supplies was delivered to Iraq from March 1997 until November 21, 2003. An additional $8.2 billion in prioritized supplies ordered under the program is scheduled to arrive in the coming months. To date, $7.6 billion in surplus funds have been transferred from the UN escrow account to the Development Fund for Iraq, monies that have been extremely useful in the implementation of various programs for the people of Iraq."""
10	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""The Environmentalists who support the wider use of biofuels picture the crops they like best. They see nodding heads of sunflowers, or the blue blossoms of the linseed plant. They talk of algae which can be grown in desert ponds, or the use of straw and other wastes to produce ethanol...But what they will not see – in fact what they flatly and repeatedly refuse to understand – is that a global commodity market selects not the most satisfying vision, but the cheapest commodity. And at present and for the foreseeable future that commodity is palm oil...  In Sumatra and Borneo, some 4 million hectares of forest has been converted to palm farms. Now a further 6 million hectares is scheduled for clearance in Malaysia, and 16.5 million in Indonesia...  Before oil palms are planted, vast forest trees, containing a much greater store of carbon than the palm trees will ever accumulate, must be felled and burnt...Having used up the drier lands, the plantations are now moving into the swamp forests, which grow on peat. When they've cut the trees, the planters drain the ground. As the peat dries, it oxidizes releasing even more carbon dioxide than the burning trees produce...  The decision by governments in Europe and North America to pursue the development of biofuels is, in environmental terms, the most damaging they have ever taken. Knowing that the creation of this market will lead to a massive surge in imports of both palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia and ethanol from rainforest land in Brazil...these imports will accelerate rather than ameliorate climate change."""
10	"Does the Phrase ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause?"	"""While I am confident this opinion [Newdow v. Elk Grove] will be overturned, it is more than a little disturbing that our nation's Constitution could be read this way. It stretches the First Amendment beyond credulity, and it places the opinion of unelected judges above the plain meaning of the Constitution and the nation's history, let alone common sense."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""In a free market, cost dictates energy choices. Fossil fuels, for example, are economically attractive for many applications because the energy available from fossil fuels is highly concentrated, easily transportable, and cheaply extracted. Renewable energies such as wind and solar power, on the other hand, are relatively dispersed, difficult to transport, and costly to harness given the capital costs of facility construction.  Many people recommend accelerated federal subsidies and preferences for renewable energy in order to reduce America's dependence on imported oil. But such recommendations fail to appreciate the fact that energy sources are often difficult to substitute for one another. Until we see major technological advances in electric-powered vehicles and related battery systems, for example, technological breakthroughs in solar or wind power will have little, if any, impact on oil imports. That's because renewable energy is used primarily to generate electricity and cannot be used directly in transportation to replace oil: in 2002, only 2.5 percent of America's total electricity was generated from oil combustion."""

In granting the pardons on January 10th, Gov. Ryan performed his historic duty as a governor to act as a 'fail safe' line of defense protecting an innocent man or woman who has not been protected from the harm of a wrongful conviction by the trial judge, or the appellate judges reviewing that conviction.

01	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?	"""Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent. That is a demonstrated error rate of 1 innocent person for every 7 persons executed. When the consequences are life and death, we need to demand the same standard for our system of justice as we would for our airlines...  It is time for the Congress to take the lead and declare once and for all that it is unacceptable to execute an innocent man or woman. It is a central pillar of our criminal justice system that it is better that many guilty people go free than that one innocent should suffer. Sadly, history has demonstrated that time and again, America has brought innocence itself to the bar and condemned it to die. That history now demonstrates that even in America, innocence itself has provided no security from the ultimate punishment...  Let us reflect to ensure that we are being just. Let us pause to be certain we do not kill a single innocent person. This is really not too much to ask for a civilized society. I urge my colleagues to join me and my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, in sponsoring the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000."""

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“The ‘evidence’ that has been invoked throughout this uniform movement has been… generalization after generalization from an ever-flowing stream of anecdote, with little to no critical thinking, and certainly no empirical investigation. The movement can be categorized as one of anecdote versus evidence, fear versus rationality, the status quo versus social and educational change… It should be clear by now that uniform policies are not effective in our public schools. …[S]chool uniforms, as a policy and strategy, do not play a role in producing more parental involvement, increased preparedness, positive approaches toward learning, pro-school attitudes, a heightened feeling of school unity and safety, or positive school climates. Therefore, such a policy should not be discussed as increasing the educational atmosphere at any level of schooling.”
01	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""This landmark legislation [the ACA] is already improving the health and financial security of our members and all Americans.  AARP supported this law because it helps many Medicare recipients avoid financially burdensome increases in prescription drug costs by closing the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, or 'doughnut hole.' The ACA also expands the number of people eligible for free preventive and wellness benefits, and cracks down on Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. Finally, for those not yet eligible for Medicare, the ACA will be instrumental in eliminating discriminatory health insurance practices such as exclusions based on pre-existing conditions, and in limiting the use of age rating to charge exorbitant premiums for older Americans.  By starting to close the doughnut hole, 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D have saved $3.7 billion since the law was enacted. In the first five months of 2012, 745,000 people with Medicare saved a total of $485.3 million on prescription drugs in the doughnut hole coverage gap for an average of $651 in savings per person this year. Over 32.5 million Americans in Medicare used one or more free preventive services in 2011. And, over 2.2 million people with traditional Medicare benefited from the new Annual Wellness Visit in 2011."""

No longer would they have to wander from agent to agent (or website to website) to find out what their options were. Nor would they have to try to translate each insurer's fine print to measure the total value of its policies.

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“I assumed that after 70 people were shot in a movie theater, and then, just a few months later, 20 first-graders were murdered with an assault rifle in an elementary school, the absurd gun laws in this country would change. But nothing has happened… My point is simple: More guns doesn’t mean less crime, as the NRA repeatedly tries to tell you. It means more gun violence, more death and more profits for the gun manufacturers. And to those who claim my gun control campaigning has been ‘anti-American,’ well, the reverse is true. I am so pro-American that I want more of you to stay alive. But I’ve made my point. I’ve given it a tremendous whack. Now it’s down to you. It’s your country; these are your gun laws.

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“The people see that church property is really, in the point of use, their property, and that it would be as sensible to tax the New York City Hall and Central Park as to tax the churches… The churches are as free to the public as the city buldings; they have been built for the use of the people, with the people’s money; and they are still supported by voluntary offerings. They are kept open to suit the necessity and convenience of the public, and all their services are for the multitude. It may be said in fact that the churches are more truly the property of the people in point of use than even the city offices, for in the churches they are always welcome, and it is not for the comfort and happiness of the clergy that these buildings are erected, but solely for the people, after the first intention of honoring God… To tax property so truly the property of the people is simply an absurdity of the same nature as taxing the public schools because they enjoy the protection of the Federal government… Such a taxation is utterly opposed to American principles, contrary to the custom of nations, very distasteful to people that believe in God and in Christ.”

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“The job protections and due process of tenure were first put into place more than 70 years ago because teachers and school employees were routinely fired for personal and political reasons. The tenure law changed that, basing personnel decisions on educational factors and providing a strong system of review by a neutral third party. The proposed bills would eliminate these basic principles and remove all checks and balances on school boards and administrators, making them wholly unaccountable for their actions. Proponents of this radical legislation complain that the current system makes it too difficult to fire bad tenured teachers. The fact is, bad tenured teachers get fired all the time, as well they should. Teachers are evaluated more than most professions, and the system provides ample opportunity to remove bad teachers.”

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	Rising levels of human-produced gases released into the atmosphere create a greenhouse effect that traps heat and causes global warming. As sunlight hits the earth, some of the warmth is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (NO2). These gases trap heat and cause the planet to warm through a process called the greenhouse effect. [8] Since 1751 about 337 billion metric tons of CO2 have been released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production, [9] increasing atmospheric CO2 from the pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm (parts per million), to a high of 400 ppm in 2013. [10] Methane, which is increasing in the atmosphere due to agriculture and fossil fuel production, traps 84 times as much heat as CO2 for the first 20 years it is in the atmosphere, [11] and is responsible for about one-fifth of global warming since 1750. [12] Nitrous oxide, primarily released through agricultural practices, traps 300 times as much heat as CO2. [13] Over the 20th century, as the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and NO2 increased in the atmosphere, [13] [14] the earth warmed by approximately 1.4°F. [99] Read More

I've had clients who want me to fight for them, and then when we win and get their death sentence converted into life, end up telling me I've betrayed them...  For California's 725 death row inmates, having their sentences commuted to life without parole would mean automatically losing their right to state-appointed lawyers to pursue their habeas corpus appeals.

01	"Should the US President Say ""So Help Me God"" with a Hand on the Bible When Taking Office?"	"""To be sure, the tradition of the President's oath of office is as old as the republic itself. The Founding Fathers were all steeped in the heritage of the Bible, and it was natural for them to incorporate the great book into the political process, even as they stipulated in the Constitution that the government 'shall make no law regarding the establishment of religion.' That clause was designed to avert the creation of a state religion, not to renounce religious belief altogether.  In order to answer our question, we must first understand what an oath---in Hebrew, a shavuah---is. It is more than an affirmation to uphold this or that commitment. The invocation of the name of G-d (while holding a Torah scroll or other sacred object) is to say that just as G-d's existence is firm and unchanging, so also is one's commitment to the task at hand. Even though, as mortals in a material world, we and our jobs do change, the intention is that our commitment is as strong and unwavering as we can make it.  If the individual is not able to carry out his oath faithfully, it is not only a violation of that solemn pact, it is a violation of the sanctity of our acknowledgment of G-d's existence. If one's commitment is supposed to be as firm as G-d's existence, and in the end, the commitment was not upheld, it is as if to say that G-d's existence is likewise weak and insubstantial. Death or illness would, of course, mitigate the wrong impression created by the failure to carry out the oath. A case of deliberate violation, for whatever reason, amounts to a desecration of the Divine Name...  Thus, swearing that one will eat a whole pizza with everything on it, or that today is the first day of the rest of your life, or that you will faithfully uphold the laws of the land when you have no intention of doing so, are all out of the question. But if you are Abraham setting out to build a nation of G-d, or (on a much lower level, to be sure), you are the incoming President of the United States, and fully intend to carry on with the moral responsibilities that come with the office, then the oath may very well be in order."""

01	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""The three purposes of criminal punishment are rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution. While civic rehabilitation is irrelevant with respect to the death penalty, that penalty does in fact deter homicide in some cases. The basic justification for capital punishment, however, is retribution...  Anger is the sentiment aroused by the sight of injustice, and is therefore, intimately allied with justice -- and civil society requires justice... anger is satisfied when retribution is exacted, yes, but that righteous anger is also rewarded when retribution is exacted. And that righteous anger should be rewarded, for its basis is the sentiment that to murder is wrong.  The common good requires that the punishment fit the crime, whether that crime be a theft of a bicycle or an ax murder. As an exercise in retribution, punishment serves to right the balance of justice that is disturbed by the crime, provided that the punishment is appropriate."""

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""In a free market, cost dictates energy choices. Fossil fuels, for example, are economically attractive for many applications because the energy available from fossil fuels is highly concentrated, easily transportable, and cheaply extracted. Renewable energies such as wind and solar power, on the other hand, are relatively dispersed, difficult to transport, and costly to harness given the capital costs of facility construction.  Many people recommend accelerated federal subsidies and preferences for renewable energy in order to reduce America's dependence on imported oil. But such recommendations fail to appreciate the fact that energy sources are often difficult to substitute for one another. Until we see major technological advances in electric-powered vehicles and related battery systems, for example, technological breakthroughs in solar or wind power will have little, if any, impact on oil imports. That's because renewable energy is used primarily to generate electricity and cannot be used directly in transportation to replace oil: in 2002, only 2.5 percent of America's total electricity was generated from oil combustion."""
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	A gold standard would restrict the ability of the federal government to increase the national debt. Under the fiat money system used by the United States the government can raise money by issuing treasury bonds – which the Federal Reserve can purchase with newly printed money. These bonds count toward the national debt. Between 1971 and 2003, the national debt went from $406 billion to $6.8 trillion - an increase of 1,600%. This increase in debt corresponded with an 1,100% increase in the money supply (M3) between 1971 ($776 billion) and 2003 ($8.9 trillion). [29] As of Dec. 26, 2012 the national debt stood at $16.3 trillion. [31] As a percentage of the GDP (gross domesic product) the national debt has more than doubled since leaving the gold standard in 1971 - going from from slightly under 30% to 67.7% in 2011.

[20] In comparison, the military's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program alone cost the United States $9.7 billion in fiscal year 2012. [21] US manned military attack aircraft cost anywhere from $18,000 to $169,000 per hour to operate - six to 42 times more than attack drones. [22] Al Qaeda spent roughly half a million dollars to plan and execute the attacks on the United States on Sep. 11, 2001.

01	Does Obamacare Place Limits on Co-Payments and Deductibles? – YES	"""Annual Deductible Limit: Beginning in 2014, the annual deductible for a health plan in the individual or small group market may not exceed $2,000 for self-only coverage and $4,000 for family coverage. For plans using provider networks, an enrollee's cost-sharing for out-of-network benefits does not count toward the annual deductible limit. HHS will increase the annual deductible limits annually. This annual deductible limit applies only in the fully-insured individual and small group markets. Thus, the limit does not apply to HealthFlex, other self-insured annual conference plans or fully-insured annual conference plans in the large group market (large group plans typically cover more than 50 employees).  Out-of-Pocket Maximum: Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA places annual limits on total participant cost-sharing for EHBs [essential health benefits]. Once the limitation on cost-sharing (i.e., the out-of-pocket maximum) is reached for the year, the participant is not responsible for additional cost-sharing for the remainder of the year. The ACA's out-of-pocket maximum applies to all non-grandfathered health plans and group health plans. This would include, for example, self-insured health plans and fully-insured health plans of any size in any market. The out-of-pocket maximums will apply to HealthFlex and self-insured annual conference plans."""
01	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?	"""The question of whether one should be able to euthanize newborns who have horrible conditions or deformities, or are doomed to a life that cannot by any reasonable light afford happiness, has sparked heated debate. Philosopher Peter Singer has argued that euthanasia is the merciful action in such cases, and I agree with him. If you are allowed to abort a fetus that has a severe genetic defect, microcephaly, spina bifida, or so on, then why aren’t you able to euthanize that same fetus just after it’s born? I see no substantive difference that would make the former act moral and the latter immoral. After all, newborn babies aren't aware of death, aren't nearly as sentient as an older child or adult, and have no rational faculties to make judgments (and if there's severe mental disability, would never develop such faculties). It makes little sense to keep alive a suffering child who is doomed to die or suffer life in a vegetative or horribly painful state. After all, doctors and parents face no legal penalty for simply withdrawing care from such newborns, like turning off a respirator, but Singer suggests that we should be allowed, with the parents' and doctors’ consent, to painlessly end their life with an injection. I agree."""

EIA indicated that U.S. electricity demand would grow 30 percent between 2006 and 2030. Likewise CO2 emissions are predicted to increase 16 percent from 2006 levels at a time when it will be essential to decrease them...  This increased energy demand will most likely result in increased greenhouse gas emissions and widespread global warming damage...  If we are to combat this looming crisis we will need a mixed bag of solutions. These will need to include command and control techniques including the use of renewable fuels such as wind and solar power, sequestration of fossil fuels, and most importantly the use of nuclear technology.  Nuclear energy has all the properties and benefits our world needs to successfully combat global climate change and meet our energy needs...  The United States has not built a new nuclear power plant in nearly 20 years.

10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Scientists use animals in biological and medical research more as a matter of tradition, not because animal research has proved particularly successful or better than other modes of experimentation. In fact, animal ‘models’ have never been validated, and the claim that animals are necessary for biomedical research is unsupported by the scientific literature. Instead, there is growing awareness of the limitations of animal research and its inability to make reliable predictions about human health. The biomedical research community and its affiliated trade associations routinely attempt to convince the general public, media, and government representatives that the current controversy over the use of animals is a life-and-death contest pitting defenders of human health and scientific advancement against hordes of anti-science, anti-human, emotional, irrational activists. Such a deliberate, simplistic dichotomy is not only false, but ignores the very real and well-documented ethical and scientific problems associated with the use of animal experiments that characterize modern biomedical research, testing, and its associated industries. The biomedical community would instead be better served by promoting increased funding and research efforts for the development of non-animal models that overcome the pressing ethical and scientific limitations of an increasingly archaic system of animal experimentation.”

Medications are tested for safety and efficacy. They are closely regulated, from production to distribution. They are accurately dosed, down to the milligram. Medical marijuana is none of those things… Patients deserve to know that whatever they are using to control their symptoms is safe and effective. And clinicians need to have confidence that a treatment will work as intended.”
01	Should Felons Be Permitted to Vote while in Prison?	"""Prison administrators have a responsibility to maintain a safe and orderly environment in prison, and they have a great discretion in determining which individual deprivations are necessary to meet these goals. But a series of court rulings has established that restrictions on fundamental rights must be justified, rather than imposed arbitrarily on inmates....

Allowing voting provides a costless way of allowing them to practice citizenship."""

10	Is There Widespread Systemic Use of Banned Performance-Enhancing Drugs by Olympic Athletes?	"""There is a major drugs scandal at every Games. The Olympics is sport played for extremely high stakes and when the stakes are high, people will do things like this. There is a continuing arms race between the dopers and the testers.  This doesn't imply that doping is endemic at the Games. Out-of-competition testing is rigorous in all Olympic sports, and you have to be incredibly clever and devious to get through. You have to be an exceptional person to get away with it.  Of course, there are a few exceptional people at the Games. I am not saying that every athlete is tainted, only that there will always be a few people who try to break the rules when the stakes are high. It is a given of human nature."""

01	Should Net Neutrality Be Restored? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Net neutrality promotes competition by providing a level playing field for new companies. According to Internet Association President & CEO Michael Beckerman, ""without net neutrality protections, startups would face discrimination from ISP owned or preferred content that’s granted a speed advantage through paid prioritization,"" thus hurting competition and consumer choice. [18][29] When the FCC implemented net neutrality rules in 2015, it warned ""that broadband providers hold all the tools necessary"" to ""degrade content, or disfavor the content that they don’t like."" [27] According to Ryan Singel, Fellow at the the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, without net neutrality ""broadband providers will be allowed to charge all websites and services, including startups, simply to reach an ISP’s subscribers. That's a huge threat to the low cost of starting a company, and it totally up-ends the economics of the internet."" [17] A group of over 1,000 startup companies, innovators, and investors signed a petition to the FCC stating that ""the success of America's startup ecosystem depends... on an open Internet—including enforceable netneutrality rules."" [19] Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said net neutrality principles must be protected ""for the next set of entrepreneurs, building their services and trying to reach users."" [24]"
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“The logic of the [lower drinking age] initiative is that if we take away the allure of illegality, American youth will stop binging. That conclusion is wrong. Alcohol should be forbidden to 18- to 20-year-olds precisely because they have a propensity to binge drink whether the stuff is illegal or not — especially males… Not all military drinking by young men and women is illegal, depending on where soldiers and sailors are stationed. Under federal law, military personnel must comply with the law of the jurisdiction in which their installation is located. Contrary to the lure-of-the-illicit theory, [a] DOD [Department of Defense] study showed that soldiers drink more when it is legal. Among the entire military (all ages), 15 percent are heavy users of alcohol in the continental United States, while outside the United States, 25 percent are heavy users. The study found that one of the factors that made binge drinking less likely was being located in the United States. This throws into doubt two fundamental assumptions of the initiative: that young people drink because of the allure of forbidden fruit; and that enforcement does not work. Young men in the military, who clearly have a very strong propensity to drink, do less of it when stationed in the United States.”
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?

01	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""The key to a reliable, diversified solar energy system based on renewable resources will be the use of hydrogen as a major energy carrier and storage medium...  The technology that will transform and drive the solar-hydrogen energy system is the fuel cell. Fuel cells use an electrochemical process that combines hydrogen and oxygen producing water and electricity. Avoiding the inefficiency of combustion, current fuel cells are theoretically twice as efficient as conventional heat engines (83% vs. 32-40%), have no moving parts, require little maintenance, and emit only water vapor... Fuel cells can be used in factories, offices and homes to generate electricity...  It is less expensive to move hydrogen up to 1,000 miles by pipeline than an equivalent amount of electricity...  Technologies and hydrogen infrastructure, such as discussed above as well as others are already in place, can pave the way for an energy transition during the next 10-15 years that is as profound as the last major energy transition which occurred over a century ago. Although the details of the Solar-Hydrogen economy are not mapped out, the broad outlines are clear. They suggest that the new energy economy will be highly efficient and decentralized. Over time, hydrogen will become the main fuel for the 21st century, derived first from natural gas but later produced from water using solar energy. The use of natural gas as a 'bridge' to hydrogen will allow a relatively seamless sequence to a renewable energy based system."""

It's difficult, in any case, for proponents of the current drugs policy to assume the moral high ground.

10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Most animal experiments are not relevant to human health, they do not contribute meaningfully to medical advances and many are undertaken simply of out [sic] curiosity and do not even pretend to hold promise for curing illnesses. The only reason people are under the misconception that animal experiments help humans is because the media, experimenters, universities and lobbying groups exaggerate the potential of animal experiments to lead to new cures and the role they have played in past medical advances… Because animal tests are so unreliable, they make… human trials all the more risky. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted that 92 percent of all drugs that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials because they don’t work or are dangerous. And of the small percentage that are approved for human use, half are relabeled because of side effects that were not identified in animal tests… Taking a healthy being from a completely different species, artificially inducing a condition that he or she would never normally contract, keeping him or her in an unnatural and distressful environment, and trying to apply the results to naturally occurring diseases in human beings is dubious at best.”
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Nowhere does the Bible repudiate capital punishment for premeditated murder; not only is the death penalty for deliberate killing of a fellow human being permitted, but it is approved and encouraged, and for any government that attaches at least as much value to the life of an innocent victim as to a deliberate murderer, it is ethically imperative."""

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“[I]f society permits same-sex marriage, it also will have to allow other types of marriage. The legal logic is simple: If prohibiting same-sex marriage is discriminatory, then disallowing polygamous marriage, polyamorous marriage, or any other marital grouping will also be deemed discriminatory. The emotional and psychological ramifications of these assorted arrangements on the developing psyches and sexuality of children would be disastrous… Certainly homosexual couples can be just as loving as heterosexual couples, but children require more than love. They need the distinctive qualities and the complementary natures of a male and female parent. The accumulated wisdom of over 5,000 years has concluded that the ideal marital and parental configuration is composed of one man and one woman. Arrogantly disregarding such time-tested wisdom, and using children as guinea pigs in a radical experiment, is risky at best, and cataclysmic at worst. Same-sex marriage definitely isn’t in the best interest of children. And although we empathize with those homosexuals who long to be married and parent children, we mustn’t allow our compassion for them to trump our compassion for children. In a contest between the desires of some homosexuals and the needs of all children, we can’t allow the children to lose.”
10	Are Electronic Voting Systems Vulnerable to Hacking?	"""None of the systems is hooked up to the Internet. The electronic voting machines are stand-alone units. Hacking into them is impossible... In the 20-plus years that these machines have been used, in many counties all across the country, there has never been a verified case of tampering...

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Say this for the GOP: by resurrecting the very bad, no good, truly awful idea of a gold standard, they’ve given us something to talk about… [A]nyone who believes that the gold standard era was marked by price stability, or for that matter any kind of stability, just hasn’t looked at the evidence. The fact is that prices have been far more stable under that dangerous inflationist Ben Bernanke than they ever were when gold ruled. I’d like to offer a different take. There is a remarkably widespread view that at least gold has had stable purchasing power. But nothing could be further from the truth… [There is] a pretty clear (and economically understandable) relationship between the real price of gold and the real interest rate: when real rates are low, real gold prices are high. And when are real rates low? High inflation can do that, as it did in the late 1970s; but so can a severe economic slump due to a deleveraging shock, as in recent years. What does that tell us about how a gold standard would work? Faced with the kind of shock we’ve just experienced, the real price of gold would ‘want’ to rise. But under a gold standard, the nominal price of gold would be fixed, so the only way that could happen would be through a fall in the general price level: deflation. So if we’d had a gold standard operating in this crisis, there would have been powerful deflationary forces at work; not exactly what the doctor ordered. The truth is that returning to gold is an almost comically (and cosmically) bad idea.”
01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""[A] zero-CO2 U.S. economy can be achieved within the next thirty to fifty years without the use of nuclear power...  The U.S. renewable energy resource base is vast and practically untapped. Available wind energy resources in 12 Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states equal about 2.5 times the entire electricity production of the United States... Solar energy resources on just one percent of the area of the United States are about three times as large as wind energy, if production is focused in the high insolation areas [strong sunlight] in the Southwest and West...  With the right combination of technologies, it is likely that even the use of coal can be phased out, along with nuclear electricity.   Complete elimination of CO2 could occur as early as 2040. Elimination of nuclear power could also occur in that time frame."""
01	Does the Declaration of Independence Set a Precedent for Religion in Government?	"""Some claim that the Declaration is not really a founding document since it was not designed to establish a new nation but only to establish a legal argument of separation from British rule. But the Constitution does not see it this way. In the same sentence that references 'in the Year of Our Lord,' we find 'and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth.' 'The Twelfth' is a reference to the Declaration of Independence which was written twelve years earlier and uses non-neutral religious terms like 'endowed by their Creator,' 'the laws of nature and of nature's God,' 'with a firm reliance on DIVINE PROVIDENCE,' and 'the Supreme Judge of the world.' While these are not specifically Christian phrases, they certainly aren't religiously neutral."""
10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Provide More Rapid Results Than Other Types of Voting Systems?	"""Not necessarily.

01	"Does Obamacare Close the ""Doughnut Hole"" in Medicare's Prescription Drug Coverage [Medicare Part D]? – YES"	"""If you thought donuts were bad for your health, consider donut holes. Specifically, the donut hole sitting smack in the middle of Medicare Part D, the program helping senior citizens pay for their medications. The donut hole is a gap in coverage causing people, once they've received a certain level of financial support for their prescriptions, to have to go it alone for a while, bearing all their medication costs until they've spent so much money that a higher level of financial support kicks in.  According to a study in the June 5th issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine... once patients reach the donut hole, they understandably look for ways to save money on their medications. Pain relievers? Patients aren't likely to scrimp on those pills. After all, no pill, no pain relief. Medications for heart burn? Same basic idea. Daily symptoms are there to remind people of the value of these medicines. Blood pressure and cholesterol pills, on the other hand, are very easy medications to forego. No one feels any different when their cholesterol rises thirty points.  Obamacare, if it remains the law of the land tomorrow, will put an end to the donut hole. It will provide more continuous coverage of Medicare recipients' prescription costs. This is good news for those of us interested in helping patients prevent things like heart attacks, which these blood pressure and cholesterol pills do well."""
01	"Should ""Blood Doping"" and Erythropoietin (EPO) Use Be Accepted in Sports?"	"""Enhancing human bodily function is, of course, common in health care on the planet Earth.

And of course, coaches, trainers, and physicians work feverishly to enhance athletic performance in hundreds of ways, often with assists from unnatural machines, diets, supplements, and drugs.   It is now standard practice...for long-distance runners and bicyclists to raise their hemoglobin concentration to unnatural levels to enhance performance. There is no moral outrage about this if it is done by simply working at a high altitude for a few months before the competition, or sleeping in a low-oxygen tent. But if an athlete autotransfuses his own natural blood before an event, or uses the approved version of erythropoetin, he is accused of 'blood doping' and may be banned for life.  If enhancement is the moral linchpin of this policy, we should be equally critical of all athletes who seek to enhance their performance, whatever the method...The quest for enhancement - to improve on normal bodily function - is inherent in sports and in health care. If the moral crusade against [blood doping] is to be based on rational argument, rather than hysteria, a better case needs to be made."""

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“When criminals get guns, they get them from friends, family, or from an underground market source. Without universal background check requirements, there is little deterrent to selling guns to criminals or gun traffickers. State laws mandating universal background checks deter the diversion of guns to criminals. The most comprehensive screening and background check processes, where potential gun purchasers apply in person for permits to purchase handguns, are associated with lower homicide and suicide rates… Better regulation of gun sales is only part of the solution. Policies should make it extremely risky for criminals to illegally carry and use guns, and we must expand efforts to diffuse conflicts involving high-risk individuals before they are settled with guns.”

Why wouldn't you want to put people through a rigorous testing process? Why wouldn't you want to better identify people who are going to be here? It doesn't make any sense to me.

10	Is the ACLU Anti-Religion?	to the hysterically overblown view so common on the religious right (a view intentionally planted there by frauds and hucksters like Pat Robertson), the ACLU regularly goes to court to defend Christian churches and organizations. It should perhaps also be noted that the ACLU was a staunch supporter, along with groups like the Family Research Council and the Christian Legal Society, of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act that was passed in 2000, as well as the Equal Access Act, which guarantees that religious groups have the same access to public facilities that any other community groups do. And of course there was the situation in Massachusetts, where the ACLU defended the right of an elementary school student who wanted to hand out candy canes to his classmates with a card attached that had a Christian message on it. Are these the actions of an organization that hates Christianity and wants to forcibly remove it from our society, as so many folks on the religious right claim?”
10	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Pew Research Center recently released estimates of undocumented populations sorted by metro area, which The Marshall Project has compared with local crime rates published by the FBI.

A large majority of the areas recorded decreases in both violent and property crime between 2007 and 2016, consistent with a quarter-century decline in crime across the United States. The analysis found that crime went down at similar rates regardless of whether the undocumented population rose or fell. Areas with more unauthorized migration appeared to have larger drops in crime rates, although the difference was small and uncertain.  Most types of crime had an almost flat trend line, indicating that changes in undocumented populations had little or no effect on crime in the various metro areas under survey. Murder was the only type of crime that appeared to show a rise, but again, the difference was small and uncertain (effectively zero)."""

10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	"Federal legislation that lowered the corporate tax rate has resulted in companies cutting jobs and disproportionally benefiting already wealthy shareholders rather than workers.

Fifteen of the companies that benefited the most from the tax holiday subsequently cut more than 20,000 net jobs. [16] Following implementation of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate and included a one-time repatriation ""tax holiday"" of between 8% and 15.5%, American companies announced over $171 billion of benefits for shareholders and $5.6 billion for workers.

01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	Vegetarians live longer. A Mar. 12, 2012 peer-reviewed study of 121,342 people found that eating red meat was associated with an increased risk of death from cancer and cardiovascular disease. [121] A peer-reviewed 2003 study found that adherence to vegetarian diets or diets very low in meat for 20 years or more can increase life expectancy by 3.6 years. [86] A peer-reviewed July 9, 2001 study of Seventh-Day Adventists who were vegetarian (or ate very little meat) showed longevity increases of 7.28 years for men and 4.42 years for women. [76] On June 3, 2013 a peer-reviewed study of 73,308 people found that a vegetarian diet is associated with a 12% reduction in all-cause mortality. [130] Read More
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“People no more have a right to health care than they have a right to education, food, or clothing… [T]he right to health care entails the power of everyone to get into the pocketbooks of everyone else. That’s not only a ridiculous notion of rights but also a highly destructive one. Since obviously people can’t go and take the money from others directly, it inevitably entails converting government into an engine of seizure and redistribution… When Americans began looking upon rights as some sort of positive duty on others to provide them with certain things, that was when the quality of health care in America began plummeting. That was what Medicare and Medicaid were all about — the so-called right of poor people and the elderly to health care. It is not a coincidence that what began as the finest health care system in the world has turned into a system that is now in perpetual crisis.”
01	Saturday Halloween - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Celebrating Halloween on a Saturday would be more fun and less stressful for everyone. Instead of rushing home from school and work to fit in dinner and homework before setting out for trick-or-treating, kids and parents could enjoy the day and do more fun Halloween activities together on a Saturday. [12] Entrepreneur Matt Douglas noted, ""Extended family could gather like they do for other major holidays and special memories can be made."" [11] With a Saturday Halloween, people who work the traditional Monday-Friday schedule wouldn't miss out on the fun of handing out candy to kids in the neighborhood. The holiday would be less stressful because parents wouldn’t have to worry about kids staying up past their bedtimes on a sugar high. [11] Plus, businesses wouldn’t lose the productivity of hungover workers who attended Halloween parties. [13]"
10	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Severe / Chronic Pain?	well-designed clinical trials have failed to show any direct benefit of marijuana in relieving pain. It’s important to remember, though, that chronic pain is complicated by mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, and I suspect that many patients with chronic pain are trying to self-treat and alleviate the depression and anxiety that accompany their pain. However, if a patient were to ask me whether or not they should use marijuana to treat their pain, I would have to respond that it’s impossible for me as a physician to endorse a therapy that is illegal, of no proven medical benefit, and possibly also dangerous. I would propose, rather, that we use well-established therapies for the treatment of depression and anxiety that are already available to us.”
10	Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?	"""Cow's milk is a foreign substance that has pervaded every corner of our diets... Today there is little doubt that early and frequent feeding of dairy products leads to greatly increased incidence of childhood diabetes. It has been confirmed that high cow's milk consumption is a major cause of osteoporosis."""
10	Do Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails Disenfranchise Disabled Voters and Language Minorities?	"""Objections have often been raised to paper ballots by advocates for voters with disabilities. On the one hand, these arguments ignore the fact that...touch-screen machines with voter-verified paper audit trails are every bit as accessible as the same machines without the audit trails."""
01	Should Fighting Be Allowed in Hockey? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Allowing fighting makes the sport safer overall by holding players accountable. Professional hockey is a fast-moving sport, and referees often miss illegal body checking, hits with hockey sticks, and other aggressive plays. Retaliation by fighting brings accountability and prevents more of those dangerous plays from happening. [10] Hockey players don't fight just for the sake of violence; combat within the context of the game serves as a deterrent to hurting star players because the aggressors know there will be pay back. Steven Stamkos, a forward for the Tampa Bay Lightning, said, ""You have to police yourselves sometimes on the ice... When you see a fight now it's a response, someone didn't like something that was done on the ice. I think you need that. It's healthy."" [11] NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman says that fighting may prevent other injuries in a fast-moving, emotional, and intensely physical game. [12] Former professional player Brandon Prust said, ""If they take fighting out... I guarantee more people will get hurt from an increase in open-ice body checks."" [13]"
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"Commercialized marijuana will create a “Big Marijuana” industry that exploits people for profit and targets children. ""Big Marijuana"" is already using similar tactics to ""Big Tobacco,"" which marketed cigarettes using ads that appealed to kids, including the Joe Camel cartoon character. [129][149] Marijuana food products that are colorful, sweet, or branded with cartoons are most likely to attract children. [103] Marijuana is available in kid-friendly forms such as gummy bears and lollipops, and products sometimes resemble familiar brands, such as ""Buddahfinger"" or ""KeefKat"" in wrappers that look like a Butterfinger or KitKat candy bar. [167][134] Mark A. R. Kleiman, a drug policy expert, said, ""[I]f you're in the [for-profit] cannabis business, casual users aren't much use to you while heavy users are your best customers, accounting for the bulk of your sales... the commercial interest demands maximizing problem use."" [147] Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, senior economist at RAND Corporation, said heavy marijuana users account for the ""vast majority of the total amount sold and/or consumed."" [148] Read More"
01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	A vegetarian diet reduces overuse of antibiotics. 70% of antibiotics sold in the United States go to livestock like cows, pigs, and chickens to prevent the spread of disease in CAFOs where animals live cramped together. [31] A peer-reviewed 2007 study from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that overuse of antibiotics in CAFOs causes antibiotic resistant bacteria to develop, which may endanger human health.

01	Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?	"Corporal punishment sets clear boundaries and motivates children to behave in school. Children are better able to make decisions about their behavior, exercise self-control, and be accountable for their actions when they understand the penalty they face for misbehaving is comparable to their actions. [24] Harold Bennet, PhD, President and Dean of the Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary, stated, ""children need to understand boundaries and I think that children need to understand that there should be punishments... in direct proportion to the improper behavior that they might demonstrate."" [16] Some experts state that corporal punishment prevents children from persisting in their bad behavior and growing up to be criminals. [27]"
01	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""Americans want to preserve our national pledge, which represents our devotion and loyalty to our country. Hand upon heart, little children across the country should be able to continue reciting this pledge without the fear of it being stripped away by activist judges. Our pledge distinguishes us from many other nations that also proclaim their patriotism. We as Americans are free from an established church and are ensured with the privilege to worship as we choose. Our pledge simply emphasizes that freedom.  The words 'under God' in our Pledge remind us of the many struggles our Founders had to endure through history to secure the freedoms we now enjoy. It is an oath uniting us as a nation and a promise to maintain the honor of our country."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“It is popular again to claim that extreme events, such as the current central US drought, are evidence of human-caused climate change. Actually, the Earth is very large, the weather is very dynamic, and extreme events will continue to occur somewhere, every year, naturally… New discoveries explain part of the warming found in traditional surface temperature datasets. This partial warming is unrelated to the accumulation of heat due to the extra greenhouse gases, but related to human development around the thermometer stations… Widely publicized consensus reports by ‘thousands’ of scientists are misrepresentative of climate science, containing overstated confidence in their assertions of high climate sensitivity… …[C]limate models overestimate the response of temperature to greenhouse gas increases. Also shown was a lack of evidence to blame humans for an increase in extreme events. One cannot convict CO2 of causing any of these events, because they’ve happened in the past before CO2 levels rose… It is a simple fact that CO2 is plant food and the world around us evolved when levels of CO2 were five to ten times what they are today. Our green world is a consequence of atmospheric CO2. And, food for plants means food for people. The extra CO2 we are putting into the atmosphere not only invigorates the biosphere, but also enhances the yields of our food crops. This is a tremendous benefit to nature and us in my view…”
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	"Abortion is the killing of a human being, which defies the word of God. The Bible does not draw a distinction between fetuses and babies: the Greek word brephos is used in the Bible to refer to both an unborn child and an infant. [30] By the time a baby is conceived, he or she is recognized by God, as demonstrated in Jeremiah 1:5: ""Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee."" [133] The Sixth Commandment of the Bible's Old Testament, ""Thou shalt not kill"" (Exodus 20:13), applies to all human beings, including unborn babies. [23] In the Hindu religion, the holy text Kaushitaki Upanishad states that abortion is an equivalent misdeed to killing one's own parents. [148] The BBC states that ""Traditional Buddhism rejects abortion because it involves the deliberate destroying of a life."" [149] Read More"
01	Should Cannabidiol (CBD) Be a Medical Option?	great therapeutic value of CBD, either given alone or in association with THC, derives from the consideration that it represents a rare, if not unique, compound that is capable of affording neuroprotection by the combination of different types of properties (e.g., anti-glutamatergic effects, anti-inflammatory action, and anti-oxidant effects) that almost cover all spectra of neurotoxic mechanisms that operate in neurodegenerative disorders (excitotoxicity, inflammatory events, oxidative injury, etc.). The reported data here, taken together with the evidence of the CBD’s almost absolute absence of side effects, including psychotropicity, suggest its great efficacy and open new horizons for the treatment of the main neurodegenerative disorders!”
