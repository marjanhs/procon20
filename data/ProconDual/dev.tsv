Many spectators would become sickened by the whole spectacle but others would love it. There has always been an appetite for freak shows.   How would the sponsors react? In the present climate, the hint of a drugs connection is enough to switch off the money tap. Sponsors back away from tainted athletes as swiftly as they cosy up to them when they are winning the medals. The television companies, who also pump millions into the sport, might take fright, too. The money might disappear."""
01	Does Obamacare's Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) Ration Medicare or Create “Death Panels”? - DEBATED	"""Clearly, the foremost achievement of President Obama's first term is the Affordable Care Act, and when fully implemented the law will move America closer to universal health coverage—something many progressives have sought for years...  That said, the law still has its flaws, and American lawmakers and citizens have both an opportunity and responsibility to fix them.   One major problem is the so-called Independent Payment Advisory Board. The IPAB is essentially a health-care rationing body. By setting doctor reimbursement rates for Medicare and determining which procedures and drugs will be covered and at what price, the IPAB will be able to stop certain treatments its members do not favor by simply setting rates to levels where no doctor or hospital will perform them."""

Churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, cathedrals, and Gurdwaras are plainly visible in the public sphere and their right to display religious symbols and to construct religious edifices is protected by the Constitution and by statutes. The ACLU has actively supported the right of people to preach their religion in public places and to go door-to-door to spread their religious messages.”

The unsecured overnight storage of Diebold voting machines and their memory cards in poll workers houses, cars, and garages in the days and weeks prior to the closely watched election between Republican Brian Bilbray and Democrat Francine Busby violated several federal and state provisions which, if not followed, would revoke the certification of use for the voting systems in any California election...  As a blood sample taken at a crime scene and then stored in someone's garage for a week before delivery to the crime lab would be considered 'contaminated' on its face - even if there had been no actual tampering to the sample - so must the world's most easily-hackable voting machines be considered as contaminated when such a massive breach of security in the chain of custody has taken place such as sending machines home, unprotected, with poll workers...

10	Are Children Who Are Raised by Gay Parents More Likely to Be Gay Themselves?	gender identity of preadolescent children raised by lesbian mothers has been found consistently to be in line with their biological gender. None of >500 children studied have shown evidence of gender-identity confusion, wished to be the other gender, or consistently engaged in cross-gender behavior. No differences have been found in the toy, game, activity, dress, or friendship preferences of boys or girls who had lesbian mothers, compared with those who had heterosexual mothers… Using data from a national sample of adolescents, no difference was found on the basis of whether the parents were the same or different genders in the proportion of adolescents who reported having had sexual intercourse, nor was a difference found in the number who reported having a ‘romantic relationship’ within the past 18 months. So few adolescents in either group reported same-gender attractions or same-gender romantic relationships that a statistical comparison was not possible. A long-term follow-up of adolescents raised by single lesbian mothers after divorce revealed similarly that their gender-role orientation (level of masculinity or femininity) was similar to those who were raised by a single heterosexual mother after divorce or by a heterosexual couple. Boys from single heterosexual mother and lesbian mother families scored higher on the scale of femininity, but they did not differ on the score of masculinity.”
10	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“There is tremendous evidence showing vaccinations prevent childhood diseases.

Prostitution flourishes in the black market that would not exist if brothels and hookers were legitimized, licensed, medically inspected, zoned and taxed. Like drugs, gambling and other crimes of morality, or alcohol prohibition of years past, the black market is nourished by draconian laws that forever fail to accomplish its intended purpose...  In Germany, and other countries, prostitution is legal and taxed. They turn the 'crime' into an economic plus. In other countries like the United States, we create the 'crime,' which turns the behavior into an economic negative. And, it's still a thriving business, law or no law."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel could 'never, ever countenance' a fully sovereign Palestinian state. The world should take him at his word. There never was a two-state solution, and there won't be one in any foreseeable future. Instead, that so-called solution serves only to enable Israel's continued oppression, empowering cynics and hard-liners and perpetuating a never-ending cycle of conflict. The only viable resolution is to unite Israel and the territories into a single state...  Israel justifies its mistreatment of Palestinians by claiming that Arabs are not its responsibility; whether they live within Israel or the occupied territories, they all ultimately belong in the unsettled West Bank and should be provided for by their own government — an attitude emphasized by Israel's recent nationality law, which defines the country as an explicitly, perhaps exclusively Jewish state.  But in a unified Israel, Arabs would be the majority if afforded the same right to return that the Jewish diaspora has; there are 3 million registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. And demographic projections suggest Jews will soon be the minority even without considering the Palestinian diaspora. Accordingly, Palestinians would have much more leverage in a one-state scenario; their quest would then be for equitable power sharing and civil rights."""

I said then that all the evidence we had then indicated we were on the right track...And now we have even more evidence, all of which indicates that our efforts are succeeding...  [I]t should come as no surprise that the Players Association does not believe that any such legislation should be enacted. As Congress has repeatedly noted, collective bargaining is the appropriate forum in which to deal with matters affecting terms and conditions of employment, even matters as controversial and politically volatile as random suspicionless employee drug testing in the absence of significant concerns about public safety. And the recent record in baseball clearly shows that we are dealing with our problems.  Finally, it should be noted that any legislation governing drug testing in private industry surely raises troubling constitutional questions. Suspicionless drug testing, mandated by the federal government, can run afoul of the general Fourth Amendment requirement that searches must be based on individualized suspicion of wrongdoing."""

Students are no longer overlooked and shuffled from grade to grade, whether they have learned the material or not.

Compare that to a scenario where undocumented immigrants are granted legal status and citizenship at the same time, the U.S. GDP would grow by $1.4 trillion over a ten year period, immigrants would help to create an additional 203,0000 jobs per year, and add $184 billion in tax revenue.

01	Has Legalizing Medical Marijuana Led to Increased Drug Abuse among Children and Adolescents?	are most at risk from legalization and the accompanying availability of recreational drugs. If drugs become more available, acceptable and cheap, they will draw in greater numbers of vulnerable youth. And because of marketing tactics of drug promoters and the major decline in drug use in the 1990s (due in great part to antidrug, education and awareness campaigns), there is a growing perception among young people today that drugs are harmless. A decade ago, for example, 79 percent of 12th graders thought regular marijuana use was harmful; only 58 percent do so today. Because peer pressure is such a factor in inducing kids to experiment with drugs, the way kids perceive the risks of drug use is critical. Legalizing smoked marijuana, giving it the government’s stamp of approval, sends the message to kids that drug use is not only harmless, but normal. This is precisely the opposite message we should be conveying.”
01	Is the Death Penalty Immoral?	"""Ultimately, the moral question surrounding capital punishment in America has less to do with whether those convicted of violent crime deserve to die than with whether state and federal governments deserve to kill those whom it has imprisoned.  The legacy of racial apartheid, racial bias, and ethnic discrimination is unavoidably evident in the administration of capital punishment in America. Death sentences are imposed in a criminal justice system that treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent.  Embracing a certain quotient of racial bias and discrimination against the poor is an inexorable aspect of supporting capital punishment. This is an immoral condition that makes rejecting the death penalty on moral grounds not only defensible but necessary for those who refuse to accept unequal or unjust administration of punishment."""

The tar sands are the dirtiest source of fuel on the planet. As I wrote in Our Choice two years ago, gasoline made from the tar sands gives a Toyota Prius the same impact on climate as a Hummer using gasoline made from oil.

Thirty-six states, and a number of inland and rural California counties that traditionally have been more permissive in defining a good cause for carrying a concealed gun, are largely not hotbeds of gun crime. In fact, the state with the lowest level of gun murders per capita, according to a 2010 FBI study, was Vermont, whose high court banned requirements on permits for carrying weapons in 1903… It is reassuring to see the O.C. Sheriff placing the law before political considerations. We hope to see police agencies in neighboring counties soon follow suit.”

Prostitution and related activities—including pimping and patronizing or maintaining brothels—encourage the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate. Where prostitution is tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery.

01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Does obesity fit the strict definition of a disease? According to Mosby’s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, & Health Professions, a disease is: 1. a condition of abnormal vital function involving any structure, part, or system of an organism; 2. a specific illness or disorder characterized by a recognizable set of signs and symptoms attributable to heredity, infection, diet, or environment. Answer? It fits. Moreover, as a physician who, like my medical brethren, has had to resort to creative diagnostic coding to work with people in the field of weight management, I’m hoping that now, with a disease designation, these people will be able to have insurance to help defer some of the costs associated with obesity. This is particularly true of those who, on paper and exam, do not yet have the metabolic syndrome, but are clearly obese and seeking help. Further, it is important that the medical community as well as the public and insurers drop their stereotypic perceptions of those who are obese, and elevate the obese condition to that of other disease conditions along with respect for those who are suffering.”

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Tenure should never prevent a school district from getting rid of bad teachers. Tenure has never been — nor should it be — a guarantee of a job for life… Ideally, tenure helps low-income schools to attract — and retain — good teachers… Students in districts with large minority populations are much more likely to be taught by new, inexperienced teachers who have only a bachelor’s degree and are often not certified in the subjects they teach… Schools in high-poverty communities are also typically underfunded, as revenues from local property taxes tend to be meager. That makes it difficult for low-income schools to find and keep top teachers… In recent years, tenure has given teachers the job security that allows them to report cheating and call attention to the deplorable conditions in low-income schools… Blaming teacher tenure for the flaws of L.A.’s troubled school system is like blaming doctors at Veterans Affairs hospitals for the deep flaws in the VA system.

The government, on average, pays about 75% of the premiums for members of Congress and other federal workers, while workers pay the other 25%. That's comparable to what big firms kick in for coverage...  With members of Congress and their staffs being forced to buy insurance on the exchanges beginning in 2014, the real question regarding Congress is how the government can continue to offer some sort of health care benefit for those federal employees, the way most big employers do...  The Office of Personnel Management, which is the government's HR department, finally decided this summer that the government will give Congressional employees a tax-free subsidy roughly equivalent to the value of the benefit they've been getting until now. That will help offset the unsubsidized cost of insurance bought through an exchange."""
01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“I say legalize marijuana because we have a chance to leave this world a better place for our children. Marijuana legalization is job creation, tax dollars, something to rejuvenate our pathetic economy. This is a multibillion-dollar industry. This is about jobs; this is about economics; this is about freedom… Cannabis is a plant that grows abundantly, that has been around long before laws existed, before our country even existed, and has a multitude of modern-day uses – aside from getting hippies high… This plant can literally end our dependence on foreign oil and fracking. This plant can literally rebuild our economy – we can make everything from car parts to airplane parts to paper to clothing to nutritious meals cheaply from it, but only if the American people are smart enough to recognize the truth from the bullshit. The truth is, none of those uses for cannabis that I just mentioned is new. They might seem groundbreaking, almost too good to be true, but there are other countries taking advantage of those uses right now, and the United States is falling behind again. We’ve known about these and many other unique benefits of cannabis for generations, yet we continue to dig a hole deeper into the sand and stick our heads in it.”
10	Is Prosecutorial Misconduct a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""Common among policy debates over habeas corpuslitigation is the question of whether to broaden or limit the scope of Federal habeas corpus review [federal case review for prisoners that have exhausted all state court appeals] for the specific purpose of acknowledging the unique and special circumstances of death-penalty cases. The effort to limit habeas corpus litigation in death-penalty cases attempts to put an end to what is now almost a ceaseless process. The effort to preserve all avenues of redress in death-penalty cases recognizes the extreme nature of the punishment...  Policymakers, judges, and lawyers rightly are concerned about the handling of death-penalty petitions...  The thoroughness of the Federal review process affirms the correctness of the State actions being challenged. Police, prosecutors, defense counsel, and State courts appear to be fulfilling their criminal detection, prosecutorial, and adjudicatory functions without abridging individual Federal constitutional rights."""
01	Should Felons Be Permitted to Vote while in Prison?	"""The most important consequence of allowing prisoners to vote is that it would remove the incentives for 'prison gerrymandering.' In most U.S. states, prisoners are counted by the census based on where they are incarcerated, not where they are registered to vote. Because most large prisons are in sparsely populated rural areas, prison complexes have an important effect on gerrymandering.   Many prisoners are racial minorities or people who live in urban areas, which means these places lose voting population, while more conservative areas gain nonvoting population. This advantages Republican congressmen in places like upstate New York, who benefit from inflated populations for redistricting purposes, but have nothing to fear at election time. Prisoner disenfranchisement therefore contributes to a structural disparity that causes Congress and state legislatures to be more conservative than the public at large."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Instead of railing against the increasing exploitation of females internationally, mainstream American feminists have mostly chosen to ignore the severe and tragic harms of prostitution. Why the wall of silence regarding men’s legitimized sense of entitlement to demand sex anytime, any way they want it, from mostly minority and poverty-stricken women?...   Rejecting prostitution is consistent with the feminist belief that men do not have a right to control women’s sexuality ever, but too many feminist women still can't say so while standing tall and without apologizing for believing it."""
10	Is There a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""The literature has taken as the dividing line between PAS [physician-assisted suicide] and AVE [active voluntary euthanasia] the matter of who acts last, causally, in producing the patients death...  In each of the cases, the doctor helps to produce or bring about his patient's death as a result of a request by a competent, informed, and autonomous individual for assistance in dying. What seems common to them all is that patient and doctor act together to bring about the death of the patient; in this light, they simply represent different ways patient and doctor may interact to produce this death. What turns, then, upon calling one PAS and calling another AVE?   Suppose a doctor rigs up a machine that enables his patient to breathe carbon monoxide but leaves it to the patient to press the button that turns on the machine: what is the difference between this case and one in which everything is the same except that the doctor pushes the button to start the machine? To say that the latter is a case of AVE while the former is a case of PAS simply becasue of who acts last is not yet to point to a moral difference between them. In both cases... what happens is that the patient and doctor act together to bring about the death of the patient. """

"""Given the rising global instability in North Korea and the Middle East, it isn't that hard to imagine terrorists getting their hands on biological, chemical or radiological weapons. With an insecure border, it is even easier to imagine those terrorists bringing those weapons across the southern border and launching a devastating attack inside America. Extending the physical and technological wall along the southern border gives us the best chance to detect and to stop the flow of drugs, humans trapped in bondage, and terror.   The communists built the Berlin Wall to limit freedom by trapping good people in. President Trump wants to expand America's border wall to protect our freedom by keeping bad people out. The difference between the two walls couldn't be greater. Yet, opponents seem to believe there is a moral equivalence between the Berlin Wall and the border wall.   Even my kids know the difference between a prison wall and a protective wall. If kids can figure out that not all walls are the same, why can't reasonable adults?"""

In only four years, it built up a work force some 400,000 strong for its multibillion-dollar annual prostitution business...  My admiration for relaxed European attitudes toward sex comes to an excruciatingly cacophonous halt on the issue of legalized prostitution.  Women's-rights activists believe the German government's sanctioning of sex services for World Cup visitors will drive the illicit international trade in sex trafficking. This, in turn, could force thousands of unwilling women into prostitution.  Whether women enter the sex trade willingly or not, no government should sanction prostitution. By its very nature, prostitution is demeaning to women and encourages anti-social, some would say depraved, behavior by men...   German officials... should ban prostitution altogether."""
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""We believe that the death penalty is an ineffective, cruel, and simplistic response to the serious and complex problem of violent crime. It institutionalizes discrimination against the poor and people of color, diverts attention and financial resources away from preventative measures that would actually increase public safety, risks the execution of innocent people, and does not deter crime. We are convinced that when the electorate is informed about the true human and financial costs associated with state-sanctioned killing, the United States will join the majority of nations throughout the world who have abolished it."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel could 'never, ever countenance' a fully sovereign Palestinian state. The world should take him at his word. There never was a two-state solution, and there won't be one in any foreseeable future. Instead, that so-called solution serves only to enable Israel's continued oppression, empowering cynics and hard-liners and perpetuating a never-ending cycle of conflict. The only viable resolution is to unite Israel and the territories into a single state...  Israel justifies its mistreatment of Palestinians by claiming that Arabs are not its responsibility; whether they live within Israel or the occupied territories, they all ultimately belong in the unsettled West Bank and should be provided for by their own government — an attitude emphasized by Israel's recent nationality law, which defines the country as an explicitly, perhaps exclusively Jewish state.  But in a unified Israel, Arabs would be the majority if afforded the same right to return that the Jewish diaspora has; there are 3 million registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. And demographic projections suggest Jews will soon be the minority even without considering the Palestinian diaspora. Accordingly, Palestinians would have much more leverage in a one-state scenario; their quest would then be for equitable power sharing and civil rights."""
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	DTC prescription drug ads help remove the stigma associated with certain diseases and medical conditions. According to a 2013 CMI/Compass survey, 52% of physicians agree that DTC ads help remove stigma associated with health conditions. [45] The removal of stigma makes it easier for patients to acknowledge their health issues and feel comfortable discussing their health problems with physicians and others. [31] The advertisements for Viagra, for example, have made male sexual dysfunction and treatment commonplace. [30] Ads for drugs treating mental illnesses like depression has contributed to de-stigmatizing those conditions, which have helped patients get treatment. [31] Read More

10	Should the US Build More Hydropower Dams?	"""All dams disrupt stream flows, degrade water quality, impede migration of fish, damage fish and wildlife habitat, and diminish or eliminate recreational opportunities. Dams cause physical and chemical changes to our waterways, including altering flow regimes and sediment transport for miles beyond the actual dam site...  Most of the viable hydropower sites in the US have already been constructed; sites that are left provide marginal power while putting tremendous strain on aquatic resources.  Most hydropower dams licensed by FERC produce very little energy; 80% of dams produce less than 50 MW of power, which is enough electricity to power 50,000 homes. New hydropower facilities are functionally obsolete due to increasing strides in energy efficiency, creation of more promising renewable energy technologies including solar and wind power, and negative environmental impacts of hydropower.  Even 'small' hydropower units cause serious environmental damage...  The costs of building new hydropower dams far outweigh the benefits. Building new dams in the name of 'renewable energy' is not justifiable."""
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“As far as I am concerned, college is a waste of time. Instead of going to college, I wish I had worked. Or even taken half of the money spent on tuition and travelled for a year or two and then worked. I bet I would have learnt a lot more, met more interesting people, developed a sense of personal responsibility earlier on, and ultimately made more money. And yes, I bet I would have been more cultured and well read. Close your eyes for a second and think wistfully about those college years. You know I am right. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. But so is all the money that is being flushed down the toilet in the elitist quest for a good education. The best education in life is falling on the ground and getting a few scrapes. You don’t get that by putting in face time on the ‘quad.’ You get it by learning the value of money, and occasionally having it robbed from you. Just don’t get robbed for four straight years.”
10	Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?	"Corporal punishment creates an unsafe and violent school environment. The American Academy of Pediatrics says corporal punishment ""may contribute to disruptive and violent student behavior.""

01	Is It Possible to Have a Meaningful Recount from an Electronic Voting Machine?	"""In the event a recount is necessary, electronic voting machines provide the most accurate and verifiable measure of voter intent of any system currently employed in U.S. elections. DRE systems have multiple redundant features to capture and store votes accurately. For example, in a recount, electronic voting machines allow election officials to print a paper image of each voter-verified screen for manual tabulation. Conversely, traditional lever machines only offer an unverifiable total number of votes cast for each candidate. The paper ballot is open to varied interpretations of voter intent and other problems such as ballot box stuffing and under and over counts.

Seldom do we see proposals that poor men should make their way out of poverty by welcoming the insertion of penises and other objects into them on a regular basis or dance naked on a stage in front of ogling and masturbating males.

Flavored milk contains the same nine essential nutrients as white milk – calcium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, vitamins A, D and B12, riboflavin and niacin (niacin equivalents).  Drinking low-fat or fat-free white or flavored milk helps kids get the 3 daily servings* of milk recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and provides three of the five 'nutrients of concern' that children do not get enough of – calcium, potassium and magnesium as well as vitamin D.

I would certainly encourage that.  I think there are efforts going on in the open source community to bring a publicly owned open source system to the voters...  I believe that in the future the counties looking to change [their] voting system, and other states and jurisdictions, are certainly going to place very high values on giving their citizens the right to review the software that defines the ballot, counts the voters, and does all these other functions.

It may take 20 years or more before alternative sources of power or heat, like solar energy, become competitive. In the meantime, demand for electricity will have nearly doubled and we will need a clean, affordable fuel to meet this growth. This is where gas will be critical in bridging the gap. Oil will however, continue to meet the growing demand for transport fuels for the foreseeable future, with gas a promising source of hydrogen in cars if fuel cells replace conventional engines.

10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“I worry about DTC ads for three reasons: 1. Drug ads strengthen our belief in pharmaceutical drugs as the cures for all of our problems. In fact, the consequences of poor lifestyle choices cannot be undone with pills. 2. Many advertised drugs are not only ineffective, but have serious side effects that are frequently played down (and occasionally concealed) by manufacturers. Because heavily advertised drugs have such vast profit potential, political and financial interests collude to speed them to market before they have received sufficient scientific scrutiny. 3. Ads circumvent better sources of information and make people believe that they are being proactive about their health when they request an advertised drug. Thirty-second TV spots that trade on emotion and celebrity contribute little or nothing of value to patient education. The free market works well in many ways, but it has failed us here. Whether it is done independently or as part of an omnibus health care reform initiative, we need to make the same decision that the rest of the developed world has made: that is, ban direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription pharmaceutical products.”

Don't be bamboozled. It's illogical to think that reducing what a hospital is paid to treat seniors won't harm their care. A mountain of scientific evidence proves the cuts will worsen the chance that an elderly patient survives a hospital stay and goes home. It's reasonable to conclude that tens of thousands of seniors will die needlessly each year.

10	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Glaucoma?	research has found that marijuana is anywhere near as effective as legal glaucoma medications… The American Academy of Ophthalmology, among other authoritative sources, says the risky side effects of marijuana (such as lowered blood pressure, increased heart rate, poor pregnancy outcomes, poor motor coordination, impaired memory and increased risk of cancer and emphysema) far outweigh any benefit. Popular opinion persistently exaggerates the benefit of marijuana for glaucoma. This is unfortunate, because people who use marijuana instead of their prescribed glaucoma medication run a big risk of having irreversible vision loss.”

No voting system currently in use in federal elections provides true voter verifiability...

There is no independent record of the voter's choices that the machine totals can be checked against... Votes are recorded in more than one location inside the machine, which can protect against certain kinds of recording and counting problems, but these are not truly independent records."""

He sought to mend America’s wounded spirit, to restore the strength of the free world, and to free the slaves of communism… His policies had a freshness and optimism that won converts from every class and every nation, and ultimately, from the very heart of the ‘evil empire.’ He won the Cold War, not only without firing a shot, but also by inviting enemies out of their fortress and turning them into friends.”
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“According to federal crime statistics, the rate of juvenile violent crime in the United States is at a 30-year low. Researchers find that people serving time for violent crimes typically consume less media before committing their crimes than the average person in the general population. It’s true that young offenders who have committed school shootings in America have also been game players. But young people in general are more likely to be gamers – 90 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls play. The overwhelming majority of kids who play do NOT commit antisocial acts. According to a 2001 U.S. Surgeon General’s report, the strongest risk factors for school shootings centered on mental stability and the quality of home life, not media exposure. The moral panic over violent video games is doubly harmful. It has led adult authorities to be more suspicious and hostile to many kids who already feel cut off from the system. It also misdirects energy away from eliminating the actual causes of youth violence and allows problems to continue to fester.”

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	A gold standard makes the supply of money vulnerable to the ups and downs of gold production. Under a gold standard the supply of money would be dependent on how much gold is produced. Inflation would occur when large gold discoveries were made and deflation would occur during periods of gold scarcity. [60] For example, in 1848, when large gold finds were made in California, the United States suffered a monetary shock as large quantities of gold created inflation. This rise in US prices caused a trade deficit as US exports became over priced in the international marketplace. [9] Read More

Simple chemistry that when we burn carbon-based materials, carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted (research beginning in 1900s)2. Basic accounting of what we burn, and therefore how much CO2 we emit (data collection beginning in 1970s)3. Measuring CO2 in the atmosphere and trapped in ice to find that it is indeed increasing and that the levels are higher than anything we’ve seen in hundreds of thousands of years (measurements beginning in 1950s)4. Chemical analysis of the atmospheric CO2 that reveals the increase is coming from burning fossil fuels (research beginning in 1950s)5. Basic physics that shows us that CO2 absorbs heat (research beginning in 1820s)6. Monitoring climate conditions to find that recent warming of the Earth is correlated to and follows rising CO2 emissions (research beginning in 1930s)7. Ruling out natural factors that can influence climate like the Sun and ocean cycles (research beginning in 1830s)8.

Retributivism is the theory that the criminal deserves to be punished and deserves to be punished in proportion to the gravity of his or her crime, whether or not the victim or anyone else desires it. We may all deeply regret having to carry out the punishment, but consider it warranted.   When a society fails to punish criminals in a way thought to be proportionate to the gravity of the crime, the danger arises that the public would take the law into its own hands, resulting in vigilante justice, lynch mobs, and private acts of retribution.

Flavored milks also have sugar added, often to the point where, ounce for ounce, they contain the same amount of total sugar as soda.  The carbohydrates in cow's milk are primarily comprised of lactose. The additional sugar in chocolate milk is sucrose just like the sugar in colas.  Two percent chocolate milk has 80% more calories and the same amount of sugar as an equivalent serving of cola. Just like 2% cow's milk, 2% chocolate milk has nearly 5 grams of fat per 1 cup serving.

As such, short samples and particular specifications may yield large but spurious correlations. We conclude that existing estimates appear to reflect a small and unrepresentative sample of the estimates that arise from alternative approaches.

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""As civil libertarians, we believe the government should not throw consenting adults in jail for private sexual conduct. An adult who chooses to engage in sexual activity, whether for recreation, procreation or in exchange for something of value, makes a private, individual choice that should not be subject to criminal sanctions. Our rights to individual autonomy and privacy allow us all to make these decisions as adults.  As advocates for equality, we know that anti-sex work laws disproportionately target women along with LGBTQ people, young people and people of color, all of whom are overrepresented in the sex industry and at highest risk of arrest. Systemic discrimination can factor into the decision to participate in sex work. In the face of job discrimination, no viable alternatives for earning a living, ejection from school, eviction from housing or ostracism from your family for your gender identity or sexual orientation, sex work may offer one of the more stabilizing and accessible ways to support yourself and your family. As criminal justice reformers, we see laws criminalizing sex work as another way of misdirecting law enforcement resources and expanding our unjust system of mass incarceration. Scarce tax dollars underwrite people's arrests and imprisonment for consensual activity. In addition to criminal records, arrests for sex work come with devastating collateral consequences, including eviction, loss of child custody and deportation."""
10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“Our examination of the evidence found no relationship between cutting tax rates on corporate profits and job growth… The willingness of individual corporations to invest their profits in expanding their businesses and employing more workers appears to be related to standard economic concerns like customer demand, developments in the industry, and perceptions of the overall health of the economy rather than tax rates paid on annual profits… Looking back over the last 65 years, there is no discernable connection between corporate tax rates and job growth.”

So many liberal politicians and self-appointed experts want to keep honest Americans from having access to firearms, even though, since 2003, in states which allow concealed carry, violent crime rates have been lower than anytime since the mid-1970s. The reverse logic of this ‘knee jerk’ reaction is astounding and has lead to an outright assault on our basic Constitutional and natural rights. These misguided policies to keep firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens literally mean a death sentence for thousands of Americans… Allowing law-abiding people to arm themselves offers more than piece of mind for those individuals – it pays off for everybody through lower crime rates… [S]ince adopting a concealed carry law Florida’s total violent crime rate has dropped 32% and its homicide rate has dropped 58%.

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Every year, measurable injuries are inflicted on tens of thousands of already at-risk children by this state’s teacher tenure system… When incompetent or negligent teachers gain tenure, dismissal procedures are so complex and costly that the process can take up to 10 years and cost up to $450,000… Another facet of the tenure system – the teachers last hired are the first fired when layoffs are required – reinforces the powerful tendency for incompetent teachers, who must teach somewhere, to accumulate in schools with the most teacher vacancies. These are disproportionately schools attended by low-income minority children… This is why there is more variation in student achievement within than between schools. This variation is especially dramatic among students from educationally disadvantaged families. A single grossly ineffective teacher can deprive students of a full year of learning, with consequences that include lower graduation and college attendance rates, and lifetime earnings more than $250,000 lower than for pupils without a single incompetent teacher… Even if the tenure laws were neither written with a discriminatory motive nor administered with a discriminatory intent, the system is now known to produce – not invariably but with a high probability – predictable patterns of disparities.”

Confusion about and misapplication of these laws also de facto disenfranchise countless other Americans.   Many disenfranchised citizens live in Florida, Iowa, or Kentucky, the three states with extreme policies of disenfranchising anyone with a felony conviction for life. These states are among those that also disproportionately suppress the voting rights of black people. In Florida and Kentucky, approximately one in five black citizens is disenfranchised due to a prior conviction. In Iowa, the longstanding system of disenfranchisement, paired with the worst disproportionate incarceration rate of black people in the nation, resulted in the disenfranchisement of an estimated one in four voting-age black men by 2005."""
10	Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Allowing easier bankruptcy discharge could destroy student loan programs. Over 40% of American students with federal student loans aren't making payments and one in six are in default. [31] In the end, the federal government collects only 80 cents on the dollar for defaulted loans, meaning the US taxpayers lose billions of dollars on those federal loans. [21] Making it easier to discharge debt in bankruptcy would increase the default rate and the money the federal government loses on its student loan programs. ""These bankruptcies could easily destroy the federal student loan programs,"" argued Allen Ertel, former Congressman (D-FL), noting that federal student loan defaults increased 300% from 1972 to 1976, when Congress enacted strict conditions for discharge. [22] The availability of private student loans increased after the 2005 law introducing nondischargeability for that type of loan; undoing that law could make private loans more expensive and difficult to obtain.

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“Given the side effects we know about, plus what we are in the process of learning, pediatricians should be questioning whether to recommend hormonal contraception [to teens] at all. Thus, increasing access while removing physician involvement is a step backwards for adolescent safety… Bottom line: adolescent physiology is unique. Studies have not demonstrated that, in this specific population, hormonal contraceptives are safe for developing brains and bodies. I fear that physicians who genuinely want to provide what is best for their patients have acquiesced to cultural mores and overlooked our gaps in knowledge regarding the full spectrum of hormonal contraception’s complications in young women. Making hormonal contraceptives available over the counter not only removes physicians from good medical decision-making for the teenager, it removes them from an important conversation about so many of the choices teens are making—choices that might be informed more by peers or perceived norms than by long-term consequences or a concerned adult.”
01	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?	"""When the life of an infant will be so miserable as not to be worth living, from the internal perspective of the being who will lead that life, both the 'prior existence' and the 'total' version of utilitarianism entail that, if there are no 'extrinsic' reasons for keeping the infant alive - like the feelings of the parents — it is better that the child should be helped to die without further suffering…   When the death of a disabled infant will lead to the birth of another infant with better prospects of a happy life, the total amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled infant is killed. The loss of happy life for the first infant is outweighed by the gain of a happier life for the second. Therefore, if killing the haemophiliac infant has no adverse effect on others, it would, according to the total view, be right to kill him…   It may still be objected that to replace either a fetus or a newborn infant is wrong because it suggests to disabled people living today that their lives are less worth living than the lives of people who are not disabled. Yet it is surely flying in the face of reality to deny that, on average, this is so.   In any case, the position taken here does not imply that it would be better that no people born with severe disabilities should survive; it implies only that the parents of such infants should be able to make this decision. Nor does this imply lack of respect or equal consideration for people with disabilities who are now living their own lives in accordance with their own wishes…[The] principle of equal consideration of interests rejects any discounting of the interests of people on grounds of disability…   So the issue of ending life for disabled newborn infants is not without complications... Nevertheless the main point is clear: killing a disabled infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at all."""
01	Do the Health Insurance Exchanges Benefit Consumers? - DEBATED	"""1. Exchanges emphasize transparency in information about quality of care. Under the Affordable Care Act, states must ensure that plans participating in the exchange meet certain quality improvement criteria. The exchanges must also provide consistent quality and cost ratings for all participating plans—enabling customers to shop more easily based on quality, price, coverage, etc.  2. Exchanges can help link quality improvement with reimbursement strategies. Exchanges can coalesce insurance purchasers throughout the state—including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, state employee benefits programs, and private employers and their purchasing alliances—so that health plans hear consistent demands for quality that they, in turn, press upon their provider networks, sparking a tighter focus on quality care.  3. Exchanges can help consumers make more informed decisions. Exchanges' Web portals can provide consumers with relevant and actionable information, not just on the availability of affordable plans—but also on quality of care. Displaying easy-to-understand information on the quality of care provided by plans (based on the performance of their provider networks) enables consumers to make informed decisions and promotes quality-driven plans.  4. Exchanges can help fuel competitiveness, which in turn can make care more consumer-centered. By offering a choice of plans and equipping consumers with information to better understand and compare options, the exchanges can push plans to compete with each other to provide quality- and value-driven plans that work for consumers."""

"""Despite what we may have learned in school, Washington did not add 'so help me God,' or at least there is no historical evidence of his having done so. The story of Washington adding these words to the oath didn't appear until 65 years after he was sworn in as president...  Not until 1881, when Chester A. Arthur becomes president after the assassination of James Garfield, do we have a documented case of 'so help me God' being added to the official oath. Today's practice of the chief justice's asking the president to repeat the phrase dates only to 1933. Moreover, clergy-led inaugural prayer is also of fairly recent vintage, having started in 1937...  As with so many stories about the practices of the Founders, historical reality often contradicts popular myth.  Beyond the question of tradition, we might ask what practices are relevant and appropriate in a pluralistic nation where 84% belong to every religion imaginable — and 16% say they have no religious affiliation...  We pray in different ways to different gods or to no god. Instead of clinging to the vestiges of a bygone era, perhaps it's time to acknowledge that civil religion, however generic, no longer represents the nation we have become.  Maybe it's time for the president-elect to add his own affirmation to the oath rather than keep 'so help me God' as a state ritual to be intoned by the chief justice. And rather than clergy-led prayer, maybe it's better to have a period of silent reflection, giving all Americans an opportunity to offer thoughts or prayers according to the dictates of their consciences."""

To us, what matters most is that the death of the patient is the intended result as surely in one case as in the other.

The examination generally includes a pap smear (the test for cervical cancer that may be combined with HPV screening), a breast exam, and pelvic exam that, among other things, screens for ovarian cancer and STIs. Additionally, these yearly exams are a good opportunity to check in with the doctor about general wellness and other preventative screenings.

But it's not a transfer tax and not likely to affect the vast majority of homeowners who sell their primary residences next year.   In fact, unless you have an adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 as a single-filing taxpayer, or $250,000 for couples filing jointly ($125,000 if you're married filing singly), you probably won't be touched by the surtax at all...  Even if you do have income greater than these thresholds, you might not be hit with the 3.8% tax unless you have certain types of investment income targeted by the law, specifically dividends, interest, net capital gains and net rental income. If your income is solely 'earned' — salary and other compensation derived from active participation in a business — you have nothing to worry about as far as the new surtax.  Where things can get a little complicated, however, is when you sell your home for a substantial profit, and your adjusted gross income for the year exceeds the $200,000 or $250,000 thresholds. The good news: The surtax does not interfere with the current tax-free exclusion on the first $500,000 (joint filers) or $250,000 (single filers) of gain you make on the sale of your principal home. Those exclusions have not changed. But any profits above those limits are subject to federal capital gains taxation and could also expose you to the new 3.8% surtax."""

01	Are Electronic Voting Machines Accessible to Disabled Voters?	"""Prior to the development of the DRE, voters with disabilities were not able to cast a secret ballot... Americans with disabilities cannot cast a secret ballot because they require assistance of someone to help them fill out the ballot. Touchscreens are the only system which allows a voter with a disability to cast a secret and independent vote...  The audio ballot and adaptive aids, such as sip and puff and jelly switches, make it possible for all of these citizens to cast a secret and independent ballot... Tens of millions of Americans can and will vote secretly and independently if, and only if, they use a touchscreen voting machine."""
01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Numerous government agencies and professional organizations have reviewed the science related to potential health effects from using wireless phones. While the specific conclusions vary, all of the reports that assess the evidence using multidisciplinary panels and a comprehensive approach reach similar conclusions; the current scientific evidence does not demonstrate that wireless phones cause cancer or other adverse health effects… Based on my review of the epidemiologic studies and consideration of experimental data in animals, I agree with the conclusions of the scientific organizations: The current scientific evidence does not demonstrate that wireless phones cause cancer or other adverse health effects.”
01	Is There an Ethical Difference Between Using Performance Enhancing Drugs and Using Performing Enhancing Technologies in Nutrition, Training, and Equipment?	"""[W]hen used by fully trained, elite athletes, [performance-enhancing] drugs can improve performance to a much greater extent than any combination of the most intensive, sophisticated, and costly nonpharmaceutical interventions known to modern sports science. Scientifically based training regimens, special diets, and complex physiological and biomechanical measurements during exercise and recovery cannot match the enhancing effects of drugs... Thus, drug use in a subgroup of athletes who -- even in the absence of drugs -- are able to compete at an elite level causes their separation into a distinct athletic population, distanced from 'natural' humans by a margin determined by the potency of the drug combinations that are used."""

01	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""Imagine that your adolescent son or daughter suffers from a serious and intractable depressive illness. Every treatment short of electroconvulsive therapy has been tried, but nothing has really worked. After years of misery, your teenage child tells you, 'That’s enough. I'm done! I'm gonna end this, one way or another.' How would you feel if your child's doctor now offered to help your child commit suicide by prescribing a lethal drug?  If you think this scenario is the stuff of Orwellian fiction, think again. So-called 'physician-assisted dying'—even for people with nonterminal illnesses, like major depression—is now accepted practice in parts of Europe. Extending this 'right' to youth with intractable mental illness could eventually become legal in Canada. And if current trends favoring 'physician-assisted suicide' (PAS) in the United States accelerate, we could find ourselves in a similar position."""
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"Legalized marijuana creates steep costs for society and taxpayers that far outweigh its tax revenues. Marijuana use harms more than just the person using the drug.

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Physiology is similar enough between humans and the rest of mammals to make it possible to translate discoveries from animals to humans. Furthermore, science has developed the right strategies to investigate human diseases in animals and use the findings to develop medications that work in humans (and in animals as well, in the case of veterinary medicine)…Not everything is smooth sailing, there are some big obstacles in translating discoveries made in animals to humans. Nobody said that science was easy. However, giving up animal research following the advice of animal rights ideologues would the most foolhardy thing to do.

10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“[T]he corporate tax debate and the jobs debate are two separate things… America has the second highest corporate tax rate in the rich world. But most American businesses don’t pay it. The President is suggesting that the corporate tax rate drop from 35% to 28%. But few of the biggest US businesses are paying that rate right now; indeed, most are paying much less – 115 of the companies in the S & P 500 paid less than 20% in tax over the last five years. And 39 firms paid less than 10%… That gets at the key issue: Fundamentally, lower taxes aren’t the reason that businesses choose to invest or not… Consider the recently released Harvard Business School study looking at insourcing and outsourcing decisions among 10,000 alumnae who are running American businesses. The key reason for outsourcing wasn’t labor cost, but a combination of cost, proximity to market, and (most importantly) better worker skill sets abroad. In order for America to create jobs at home, we need to do the heavy lifting to reform education and develop workers who can do the sort of jobs businesses need them to do… Nobody ever stopped investing because of high taxes.”

Today's final rules finalize the proposed simpler definition of 'religious employer' for purposes of the exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement in response to concerns raised by some religious organizations. These employers, primarily houses of worship, may exclude contraceptive coverage from their health plans for their employees and their dependents.   The final rules also lay out the accommodation for other non-profit religious organizations - such as non-profit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education - that object to contraceptive coverage. Under the accommodation these organizations will not have to contract, arrange, pay for or refer contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds, but such coverage is separately provided to women enrolled in their health plans at no cost. The approach taken in the final rules is similar to, but simpler than, that taken in the proposed rules, and responds to comments made by many stakeholders."""

01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“The [standardized] tests remain an important part of holding schools accountable and shouldn’t be minimized or dismissed as just a bunch of data. (Are you listening, Gov. Jerry Brown?) The concrete results from the tests force us to see truths we could otherwise avoid — especially now, as other mechanisms of accountability fall by the wayside… The new tests, based on the Common Core curriculum standards, are designed to measure critical thinking in a nuanced way. They might fall short in some ways. But they do measure skills learned and material understood, if not comprehensively. They can’t be hidden underneath social promotion or grade inflation or meaningless diplomas. In today’s tangle of upbeat school talk and colored charts, annual test scores provide a badly needed measure of objective clarity.”

The DREAM Act or its DACA mutant, however, is something we shouldn't applaud, if only because American children and their parents have dreams too and those are being underserved.

10	Should Congress pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act?	"""While both S.1871 and S.1903 [versions of the STOCK Act] are well intentioned, they leave major loopholes that undercut their deterrent effect, because much material, nonpublic information that a Member of Congress receives does not relate to ‘pending or proposed legislation’ (as these proposed statutes would require)...  [T]his statute extending the insider trading prohibition to Members of Congress would overreach; that is... it could prove a trap for the unwary, snaring relatively innocent mistakes by busy Members of Congress. Or it could impose illiquidity on Members of Congress who would not dare to trade...  ...Congress should not attempt a comprehensive statute defining all of insider trading law. Congress has attempted that before, only to give up. The moment Congress attempts a comprehensive statute, special interest groups will appear in droves, seeking safe harbors for their members. The result could give rise to even greater uncertainty...  ...Congress should pursue a narrow, surgically targeted statute and not take on the very complex problem of codifying the entire law of insider trading. That could prove a disaster.”"
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“The arguments against them collapse under scrutiny – and they are the most ‘democratic’ weapon ever invented. A peer who ought to know better said in the House of Lords the other day that the drone was especially dangerous since it ‘kills people remotely from some leafy suburb in the middle of one’s own country’ — as though this was somehow happening in a garden shed close to you. But of course it is not. Yes, these decisions are being controlled from thousands of miles away. But is that more thousands of miles away than the decision to send in a stealth fighter? Or give the order to launch a missile from a nearby Special Forces team? Or a Cruise missile from a submarine? And — and here’s the point — thousands of miles from the battlefield is thousands of miles closer to the politicians who have to be accountable. It is said that every week President Obama sits down with his advisers and personally decides how drones will be used in the week ahead. Can we imagine what that must be like for a democratically elected politician? No taking shelter behind a command chain that reaches right down to the judgment of the poor bloody soldier on the ground. This time the President is personally involved — personally accountable; perhaps even in a way that could, theoretically at least, be open to challenge before an international court of law. So if we want political accountability for the violent actions of war taken in our name — and presumably we do — then we get more of it, not less, from a decision by a politician to launch a ‘smart’ bomb from a drone than one taken, for instance by a pilot in a split second, in the heat of conflict, 25,000ft above the battlefield.”
01	Does Illegal Immigration Pose a Terrorist Threat to the United States?	"""Most such migrants [illegal aliens] are gainfully employed here, pay taxes, and many have started families and developed roots in our society...

10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Raw milk is inherently dangerous and may contain a whole host of pathogens...  Claims that raw milk has miraculous disease-curing properties are not supported by the scientific literature...  Permitting raw milk sales, or the operation of so-called 'cow-share' schemes to occur within any given jurisdiction, will not result in the maintenance or further strengthening of our food safety systems. On the contrary, permitting such sales and schemes will inevitably result in an increased incidence of foodborne illness...  Raw milk is inherently dangerous and should not be consumed. Raw milk continues to be a source of foodborne illness and even a cause of death within the United States. Despite the claims of raw milk advocates, raw milk is not a magical elixir possessing miraculous curative properties. Pasteurization destroys pathogens and most other vegetative microbes which might be expected and have been shown to be present in milk.

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel could 'never, ever countenance' a fully sovereign Palestinian state. The world should take him at his word. There never was a two-state solution, and there won't be one in any foreseeable future. Instead, that so-called solution serves only to enable Israel's continued oppression, empowering cynics and hard-liners and perpetuating a never-ending cycle of conflict. The only viable resolution is to unite Israel and the territories into a single state...  Israel justifies its mistreatment of Palestinians by claiming that Arabs are not its responsibility; whether they live within Israel or the occupied territories, they all ultimately belong in the unsettled West Bank and should be provided for by their own government — an attitude emphasized by Israel's recent nationality law, which defines the country as an explicitly, perhaps exclusively Jewish state.  But in a unified Israel, Arabs would be the majority if afforded the same right to return that the Jewish diaspora has; there are 3 million registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. And demographic projections suggest Jews will soon be the minority even without considering the Palestinian diaspora. Accordingly, Palestinians would have much more leverage in a one-state scenario; their quest would then be for equitable power sharing and civil rights."""
01	Should the US Subsidize Alternative Energies?	"""If renewable energy is getting so cheap, why do we still need policies and subsidies to support it? Here's why. Even if they're now, finally, cost-competitive at the point of sale, low-carbon technologies are still working with an infrastructure—a utility regulatory system, a power grid, a highway system, a combustion engine-centric fueling system—built for a world powered by fossil fuels. These massive infrastructure projects were built up with public-sector support, including tax credits, low-cost loans, and outright grants from the federal government. Companies designing new energy sources, in contrast, often have to build their own infrastructure and factor it into their costs…  Not only was the playing field built for carbon-intensive energy technology; it is still tilted strongly in that direction by ongoing government subsidies for fossil fuels. Despite the pledge by G-20 countries in 2009 to end handouts for fossil fuels, those subsidies continue to grow. Here in the U.S., the International Monetary Fund has found that the government provides $700 billion a year in subsidies to fossil fuel companies, equivalent to every American handing these companies a check for $2,180 each year.  The world's citizens are increasingly clear about the major risks we face by continuing our dependence on carbon-intensive energy sources. Innovators and entrepreneurs are stepping up to the plate with amazing new low-carbon technologies to move us forward in a more sustainable direction. But just as with any other major economic transition—the Industrial Revolution, the Marshall Plan, the fall of Communism—there is a role for government policy, finance and investment in speeding the adoption [of] the new, while easing the phaseout of the old."""

Two studies were conducted in groups of children with 'recurrent abdominal pain of childhood,' one study preformed in Boston and the other in San Francisco, came to a similar conclusion. The conclusion was that about one-third of such children had their symptoms on the basis of lactose intolerance. The simple solution was to remove all milk and milk-containing foods from the diet."""

We are just beginning to see a thaw in a huge glacier that we've been locked into with the death penalty since 1976. At least six states have initiatives for a moratorium, most recently in Illinois. Polls show that support is dropping. It's down to sixty-one percent from seventy-five percent. In 1999 it dropped five percent. I think people are more aware of the eighty-seven innocent people that have now come off of Death Row, that the supposed best criminal justice system in the world has a lot of flaws in it.

The average prostitute services between 10-15 clients per day. This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution."""

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“If the government begins to tax contributions… [c]hurches may well resist payment of those taxes, even to the point of closing the church’s doors.

This is money to which the government has no right, and to seek it violates a law that God has established which overrides government authority. Literally the government would be robbing God. That is not a safe thing to do. But should the confiscation of church giving come to pass, it would reduce a church’s income significantly. Would the government claim twenty-five percent? Add that to the loss of a tax deduction on the part of donors, and a church’s income might be reduced by fifty percent, for the government would be taking money away from the donor through personal taxation that he currently has available to give to his church.”
01	The Electoral College: Top 3 Pros and Cons	The Electoral College guarantees certainty to the outcome of the presidential election. If the election were based on popular vote, it would be possible for a candidate to receive the highest number of popular votes without actually obtaining a majority. [11] This happened with President Nixon in 1968 and President Clinton in 1992, when both men won the most electoral votes while receiving just 43% of the popular vote. [11] The existence of the Electoral College precluded calls for recounts or demands for run-off elections. The electoral process can also create a larger mandate to give the president more credibility; for example, President Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote in 2012 but 61.7% of the electoral votes. [14] In 227 years, the winner of the popular vote has lost the electoral vote only five times. [2] This proves the system is working.

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Nothing's changed since Ipswich. Five women can be murdered and nothing will be done. A hundred sex workers have been killed in the last 10 years. Sex workers face rape, violence, and murder every day they're out there. It's a fact of the system and the Government knows this.   But sex work doesn't fit the Government's ideas of morality. It starts from a position that all prostitution is violence against women. The police say they won't accept street prostitution, so the women are all criminals... Where prostitution is legal, in Utrecht and Cologne, there have never been any murders.  The sale of sexual services per se is not all that different from selling other services. I don't think that sexual labour under the right conditions, as opposed to mental labour or physical labour, is about violation. Loads of sex workers have done professional jobs. A lot have been nurses. They say they did far more dehumanising things as nurses than in sex work. And they now have control over the hours they work.  Street prostitution is never going to be eradicated. Enabling women to do it safely is what policy should be about... There is an argument that regulation increases prostitution, but how do they know? If local authorities gave brothels licences they would have the ability to control it. You would have quotas and limits."""

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“We recognize that the individual right to bear arms is an important part of the American tradition, and we will preserve Americans’ Second Amendment right to own and use firearms. We believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation. We understand the terrible consequences of gun violence; it serves as a reminder that life is fragile, and our time here is limited and precious. We believe in an honest, open national conversation about firearms. We can focus on effective enforcement of existing laws, especially strengthening our background check system, and we can work together to enact commonsense improvements–like reinstating the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole–so that guns do not fall into the hands of those irresponsible, law-breaking few.”

01	Does Islam Support the Death Penalty?	"""According to the Islamic injunctions, death penalty can be administered in two cases only. Firstly, if a person is physically harmed or injured by another, Islam directs the state to provide justice to the individual (or his relatives) by letting him/them harm or injure the guilty to the same extent, as he himself was guilty of harming his victim, in the first place. This concept of punishing the guilty is known as 'Qisaas', which means 'to follow suit' or to deal with the criminal in a manner similar to the act originally committed. In other words, the criminal is to be killed or injured in the same way as he himself killed or injured his victim...  Secondly, the death penalty may be administered if the criminal is guilty of 'Hiraabah' or 'Fasaad fil Ardh'. 'Hiraabah' and/or 'Fasaad fil Ardh' include crimes committed against the community, rather than an individual or crimes that are of the nature of religious persecution or crimes committed with the objective of spreading a wave of terror through the community or crimes committed against the state.""  [Editor's Note: The above quote states that only ""two cases"" exist for which the Qur'an allows the death penalty. The first case is for murder. The second case applies to ""crimes committed against the community"" which, depending on who is interpreting the Qur’an, may include: treason, apostasy (when one leaves the faith and turns against it), terrorism, piracy, rape, adultery, and homosexual activity.]"
01	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Reducing Nausea and Vomiting from Chemotherapy?	anti-emetic properties of cannabis have been studied in humans more widely than any other indication. Nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy was felt to be one of the best supported therapeutic uses of cannabis and cannabinoids by the British Medical Association in their review of 23 studies, and was also supported by the American Institute of Medicine. This indication for cannabis has become common knowledge among patients, was the subject of a popular book, and has received some endorsement amongst American oncologists in a survey study. A large body of knowledge has now been amassed in this context as a result of state-sponsored studies in the USA in cancer chemotherapy. Pooling available data in some 768 patients, oral THC provided 76-88% relief of nausea and vomiting, while smoked cannabis figures supported 70-100% relief in the various surveys.”

You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win."" [20] Just as in 2000 when George W.

01	Should the ACLU Challenge Government Sponsorship of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)?	of [the] lawsuits [regarding BSA’s discriminatory policies] have revolved around the issue of whether or not the BSA is a ‘place of public accommodation’ which would be prohibited from engaging in discrimination on the basis of religion or, under some state and local laws, on the basis of sexual orientation. The BSA has argued in those court cases that they are a private organization which has a right to restrict its membership, leadership and hiring on the basis of religion and sexual orientation. And yet, when it is pointed out that the state and federal constitutions prohibit government sponsorship or support of religious institutions, the BSA sometimes attempts to argue that it is not a religious institution. The BSA can’t have it both ways. If the organization wants to continue to have discriminatory policies, it must forego government sponsorship and financial support of its programs.”
01	Does Obamacare Require Insurers to Offer Coverage for Treatment of Mental Illness? – YES	"""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as modified by P.L. 111-152, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010) contains a number of provisions that generally combine to extend the reach of existing federal mental health parity requirements. Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness had historically been less generous than that for other physical illnesses. Mental health parity is a response to this disparity in insurance coverage, and generally refers to the concept that health insurance coverage for mental health services should be offered on par with covered medical and surgical benefits...  PPACA expands the reach of federal mental health parity requirements to three main types of health plans: qualified health plans as established by the ACA; Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans; and plans offered through the individual market."""

His assisted suicide doctor did nothing to care for his pain and palliative care needs. This seriously ill patient was receiving poor advice and medical care because he had lethal drugs."""
01	Does a Person's Income Level Affect the Likelihood of Him/Her Receiving the Death Penalty?	"""[A] large part of the death row population is made up of people who are distinguished by neither their records nor the circumstances of their crimes, but by their abject poverty… and the poor legal representation they received…  There are several interrelated reasons for the poor quality of representation in these important cases. Most fundamental is the wholly inadequate funding for the defense of indigents. As a result, there is simply no functioning adversary system in many states. Public defender programs have never been created or properly funded in many jurisdictions. The compensation provided to individual court-appointed lawyers is so minimal that few accomplished lawyers can be enticed to defend capital cases…  Although the Supreme Court has held that indigent defendants may be entitled to expert assistance in certain circumstances, defense attorneys often do not even request such assistance because they are indifferent or know that no funds will be available. Courts often refuse to authorize funds for investigation and experts by requiring an extensive showing of need that frequently cannot be made without the very expert assistance that is sought. Many lawyers find it impossible to maneuver around this ‘Catch 22.’”"

Marijuana is a drug. It’s not good for you, it can be abused. And it’s here today and it’s going to be here tomorrow. What we need to do is take that black market down and turn it into a highly regulated and highly taxed legal market, so that we can gain credibility and focus on the real risk to young people in our society which is hard drug abuse… It’s 2017. We know what happens when we legalize marijuana for adult recreational use. Use does not go up, teen use does not go up, DUIs don’t go up, crime doesn’t go up. The only thing that goes up is tax revenue. In my state [Washington], we have 300 million dollars this year in tax revenue… We’ve taken a black market, which was empowering and enriching organized crime and games, and we’ve dismantled it. We’ve turned it into a highly regulated, highly taxed legal market, employing 26,000 people, especially in rural areas where we can use the employment. We’ve been able to redirect precious law enforcement resources away from petty pot issues and on to serious crime.”
01	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Unlike fossil energy, which is discovered, renewable energy is conceived and created in labs and universities, brought to commercial readiness by developers, manufactured as component parts, and assembled into finished products. In the end, renewable energy is manufactured energy. A national energy policy that provides energy security and stabilizes climate change will create a huge demand for renewable energy projects, which can, with the right set of policies, be used to revitalize the manufacturing sector and create the workforce to serve that sector…  Over the past decade, our energy policy has been concentrated almost entirely on supporting the development of fossil fuel resources. To the extent renewable energy was supported, it was through a patchwork of state level requirements to install renewable energy projects combined with erratic federal incentives in the form of production tax credits. Absolutely no attention was paid to supporting the development of a full-fledged renewable industry…  [M]odern wind turbines are complex machines that require manufacturing components ranging from gearboxes to electronic controls to the high-tech carbon fiber composites used to make the turbine blades. When the analysis of economic benefits shifts from project development to component manufacturing, a completely different picture emerges. For wind alone, there are more than 16,000 firms active in the industrial sectors where components would be manufactured. When the analysis is expanded to include other renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic, biomass, and geothermal sources, the number of firms grows to more than 42,000. In the course of a decade, the new investment will exceed $160 billion, and create more than 2,000,000 full-time equivalent jobs (a full-time equivalent job is 2,000 hours of required labor)."""

In Iowa, action by the governor in 2011 caused the state to move from automatic restoration of rights – following the completion of a criminal sentence – to an arduous process that requires direct intervention by the governor himself in every individual case...   That's moving backwards – not forward. It is unwise, it is unjust, and it is not in keeping with our democratic values. These laws deserve to be not only reconsidered, but repealed. And so today, I call upon state leaders and other elected officials across the country to pass clear and consistent reforms to restore the voting rights of all who have served their terms in prison or jail, completed their parole or probation, and paid their fines."""

"""Any comprehensive strategy must recognize that our energy challenges have been decades in the making and certainly won't be resolved overnight. So even as we rightly place a great deal of emphasis on renewable energy and alternative fuels, it is clear that our economy is – and will remain for some time – dependent on fossil energy. We must diversify the available supply of conventional fuels and expand production around the world and here at home– including within a small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and portions of America's Outer Continental Shelf – in an environmentally sensitive and efficient manner. Also, we must maintain an adequate liquefied natural gas infrastructure and promote the development of nontraditional fossil fuels like oil shale and oil sands."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“A high percentage of meteorologists and/or climate scientists do not agree that the climate changes we have seen are mostly manmade. Thousands of us think the larger part of the climate changes we have observed over the last century are of natural origin. I believe most of the changes that have been observed are due to multi-decadal and multi-century changes in deep global ocean currents. Such changes have yet to be properly incorporated into the global models or into most climate modelers’ thinking… Many scientists believe a slightly warmer world would be, in general, more beneficial for humanity. The small changes in climate we have seen so far and the changes we will likely see in the coming decades are not potentially dangerous. It has been noted that vegetation growth is enhanced by higher CO2 levels… [T]he global climate models will never be able to replicate the complex global atmosphere / ocean environment and its continuing changes… We should all call out faulty science wherever we see it, including the blind belief (without any evidence beyond the faulty models) that humans are largely responsible for climate change.”

Extensive research evidence indicates that media violence can contribute to aggressive behavior, desensitization to violence, nightmares, and fear of being harmed… Correlational and experimental studies have revealed that violent video games lead to increases in aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and decreases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal studies designed to isolate long-term violent video-game effects on American and Japanese school-aged children and adolescents have revealed that in as little as 3 months, high exposure to violent video games increased physical aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies in Germany and Finland have revealed similar effects across 2 years.”

Indeed, private political associations (interest groups and political parties) have been involved in the administration of elections for a very long time. These private associations provided ballots under the ballot systems used before secret ballots were introduced.  Private firms have also been involved in election administration, a fact consistent with a trend over the last few decades of many local governments outsourcing certain functions that were previously managed and operated by those governments. There have been many reasons for this practice, including a belief that outsourcing will result in greater responsiveness and reduced costs...  In election administration, private firms have for many years routinely undertaken certain election administration tasks such as the design, layout, and printing of ballots - a practice that generates little controversy. But local government are also turning to private firms to provide electronic voting systems, to program them appropriately, and to repair and maintain them over time...

10	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""Websites in many foreign countries induce pregnant women to come to and pay up to $80,000 to 'maternity hotels' in the United States, on the promise of American citizenship to the newly-born child who then returns to the foreign country. Mexican pregnant women cross the border to give birth in near-border U.S. hospitals for the same purpose. Many illegal immigrants in this country have children with the expectation that the child will be a U.S. citizen at birth, and thereby anchor the parents to be able to remain here…   We start with the relevant words of the 14th Amendment ratified on July 9, 1868. It requires that two conditions—not just birth in this country—be present for citizenship to be granted: (i) the baby must be 'born … in the United States;' and (ii) when born, the baby must be 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States. A cursory glance at the words themselves makes it clear that those who argue that mere birth within the United States results in citizenship fail reasonably to address this second requirement….   Another reason the Birthright Citizenship provision does not give automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal or transient aliens is that there is no evidence that those who voted to adopt the 14th Amendment even considered such a scenario. The purpose of this portion of the 14th Amendment was, as one senator put it during the Senate debate on the 14th Amendment, 'simply to declare that Negroes shall be citizens of the United States,' and therefore guaranteed equal citizenship rights in the aftermath of the Civil War.   Furthermore, they could not have intended to grant citizenship to children of illegal aliens because no category of 'illegal aliens' then existed. In 1866, when Congress approved the amendment, immigration was essentially unhindered; any immigrant was a legal immigrant, entitled to citizenship after a minimum residence period."""

He then switched without any apparent strain to a policy of backing Saddam Hussein against Iran… He was as dumb as a stump… Year in and year out in Washington, I could not believe that such a man had even been a poor governor of California in a bad year, let alone that such a smart country would put up with such an obvious phony and loon.”

It's an interesting debate taking place in America -- I'll give you my position. One, I do not think we ought to grant amnesty to people who are here illegally. And the reason I don't is I think that will encourage a whole other bunch of people to come. But I know you cannot deport 10 million people who have been here working. It's unrealistic. It may sound good in certain circles and political circles. It's not going to work. The best plan is to say to somebody who has been here illegally, if you've been paying your taxes, and you've got a good criminal record, that you can pay a fine for being here illegally, and you can learn English, like the rest of us have done, and you can get in a citizenship line to apply for citizenship.

A 2016 study found ""strong and consistent evidence"" that school voucher students in Louisiana attending private schools ""performed significantly worse in math."" [6] Another study of Louisiana's program found attendance at a voucher-eligible private school increased the likelihood of a child failing math by 50%, and ""negative and large"" effects on reading, science, and social studies. [3] In Milwaukee, researchers found that students using vouchers to attend private schools fared ""no better academically than their public school peers."" [2] In Indianapolis, students who left public schools to attend private Catholic schools with vouchers showed ""no benefit"" in reading skills, while suffering ""moderate and statistically significant average annual losses"" in math, while those same students had been improving in public schools.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""Retribution is just another word for revenge,  and the desire for revenge is one of the lowest human emotions — perhaps sometimes understandable, but not really a rational response to a critical situation. For a Christian,  this is an urge to use  violence for one’s own purposes, and urge which should be resisted. To kill the person who has killed someone close to you is simply to continue the cycle of violence  which ultimately destroys the  avenger as well as the offender.  That this  execution somehow give 'closure' to a tragedy is a myth. Expressing one’s violence simply reinforces the desire to express it. Just as expressing anger simply makes us more angry. It does not drain away. It contaminates the otherwise good will  which any human being needs to progress in love and understanding."""

10	Did Dr. Jack Kevorkian Ethically Serve the Best Interests of His Patients?	"""By invoking the physician-patient relationship to cloak his actions, Jack Kevorkian perverts the idea of the caring and committed physician, and weakens the public's trust in the medical profession.  The AMA establishes the Code of Ethics for the medical profession. One of the fundamental principles of that code is that physicians must not act with the intent of causing the death of their patients. Physician-assisted suicide is simply incompatible with the physician's role as healer. When faced with patients who are terminally ill and suffering, physicians must relieve their suffering by providing adequate comfort care.  This obligation is paramount: It is ethical for physicians to provide effective pain medication even if the medication may have the side effect of suppressing respiration and hastening death...  [N]o civilized society should condone assisted suicide as practiced by Jack Kevorkian. Mr Kevorkian's actions are not those of a primary treating physician.

To understand these different courses of action, to explain why I believe an invasion is the United States' best course, and to help the reader make up his or her own mind, this book is organized into three parts. The first part presents a brief description of Iraqi history and U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf, a short biographical sketch of Saddam Hussein, and the history of U.S.-Iraqi relations since 1979. The second part provides an overview of Iraq today, the nature of Saddam's totalitarianism, the threat that Iraq presents to the region and the United States, and a summary of how the different states of the Middle East see Iraq. The final part of the book then assesses each of the policy options in turn, drawing on the background provided in Parts I and II to explain the benefits and liabilities of each.""  "

It is unsurprising that the loudest complaints about death penalty delays come from death penalty opponents who have created them...  Claimed 'cost studies,' often performed by or at the behest of death penalty opponents, are frequently so incomplete as to be false and misleading. For example, they don't take into account the increase in the cost of life without parole cases if there were no death penalty. Criminal defendants who are facing the death penalty — which today must be pleaded by prosecutors up front — often want to make a deal by pleading guilty to first degree murder in exchange for a sentencing recommendation of life without parole. The existence of the death penalty as a possible sentence leads to guilty pleas that save the money spent on trials and limit the opportunity for appeals."""

When errors in BDFs do occur - leading, for example, to votes for one candidate being credited to a different candidate - they can be detected with optical scan voting systems, because anomalous computer-reported results can be discovered through manual recounts of paper ballots. With paperless DREs, however, there is no way to perform such a recount."""

01	Does the ACLU Undermine the War on Terror?	to the ACLU, the government’s ‘war on terror’ (scare quotes in the original) is simply a charade cooked up by the Bush administration and John Ashcroft to enslave the country. In the ACLU’s worldview, it is the administration, not the 9/11 attacks, that has ‘created a climate of fear’ nationally. Al Qaeda? Never heard of it. In all the documents that have poured from the ACLU’s presses since the funding flap became public, you’ll never discover that what the ACLU feverishly refers to as ‘blacklists’ are in fact lists of suspected terrorists and terror organizations. The ACLU can barely bring itself to use the word ‘terrorism’ without putting the offensive phrase in scare quotes… The denial by the Left that Islamic death cells threaten the U.S. clears up one mystery. To outside observers, the refusal to balance the putative claims of unfettered freedom against the desirability of, say, remaining alive can seem the most perverse aspect of civil-libertarian ideology. But civil-rights absolutism makes more sense once you understand that the civil libertarians have apparently convinced themselves that terrorism is just a Republican bugaboo. Such fantasies make for great fundraising pitches. The ACLU has been raking in the dough — and not just from payroll deductions — since 9/11. But the Left’s blindness to the reality of foreign enemies should utterly disqualify it from government influence. That is not the case. Civil libertarians and privacy advocates exercise veto power over government research in the crucial fields of data mining and computer technology. The Department of Homeland Security recently cancelled a program to screen airline passengers for terrorist connections because privacy advocates objected. The next time a public official feels inclined to listen to a rights lobbyist, he should administer a simple sanity test: Do you believe that terrorism exists?”

Historians will see in these attacks rhetoric and ideology unhinged from reality, a worship of materialist goals, contempt for traditional values, and a moral stinginess that denies credit for good work to any but political allies...   The critics endorse the big lie of Pretty Woman and act as if the Julia Roberts character exists beyond Hollywood. The critics routinely seek 'sex worker unions,' government-trafficker condom distribution partnerships, and government regulation -- as if written contracts or OSHA [US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration]-mandated ergonomic mattresses could ever trump the ability of pimps to exploit the abused and psychologically manipulable runaway girls they prey upon."""
01	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""Climate change is impossible to hide and ought to be impossible to ignore. The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 1990. Arctic sea ice has declined to the lowest levels on record and studies suggest that two-thirds of the world's polar bear population will be gone by 2050. But more than polar bears and ice caps are at risk—climate change endangers all life on our planet...  Although there has been a great deal of variability in the Earth's climate over time, many scientists believe that the changes we are seeing cannot be accounted for by natural variability alone. Climate change is a man-made problem. Human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil - along with deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes, are responsible for the changes. Every bit of coal, every liter of oil or gas that humans burn adds to the carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, and have become much more concentrated since the onset of industrialization. Such increases, coupled with the incremental increase of other greenhouse gasses, have the potential to raise global temperatures between 2 ½ and 10°F over the next century."""
01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""It would be much easier to eliminate the anti-doping rules than to eliminate doping. The current policy against doping has proved expensive and difficult to police. In the near future it may become impossible to police...  Because doping is illegal, the pressure is to make performance enhancers undetectable, rather than safe. Performance enhancers are produced or bought on the black market and administered in a clandestine, uncontrolled way with no monitoring of the athlete's health. Allowing the use of performance enhancers would make sport safer as there would be less pressure on athletes to take unsafe enhancers and a pressure to develop new safe performance enhancers and to make existing enhancers more effective at safe dosages...  The removal of doping controls would have major benefits: less cheating, increased solidarity and respect between athletes, more focus on sport and not on rules."""

Stymied in their efforts to make abortion illegal again, some anti-choice extremists resorted to murder as the ultimate weapon in the ‘war’ they claim to be waging… Anti-choice activists, like those espousing any cause, are properly protected by the First Amendment when they speak, march, demonstrate, pray, display images, or associate with others in these activities. Their expression may be harsh, unsettling, and offensive and still be protected by the First Amendment. But protesters may not physically obstruct others from exercising their rights, threaten doctors’ lives in an effort to scare them away from abortion practice, nor break the bounds of peaceful expression and assembly. The First Amendment does not protect people when they turn to shooting doctors, kidnapping clinic staff, destroying medical equipment, planting bombs, setting fire to clinics, threatening violence, or blockading clinic entrances. The Constitution does not — and never has — provided immunity to vigilantes.”
01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“It is difficult to conceive of any meaningful accountability system in which rigorous, objective information about student achievement—that is, standardised test data—would not be a necessary component… There is simply no assessment in existence today, nor has there ever been any test that simply measures whether students can fill in a bubble. As a starting point, we need to recognise both the limitations of current tests, but also their strengths. The typical statewide NCLB tests administered today in every American state are far and away the most accurate, free-of-bias, dependable, and efficient tests that a student will encounter in his or her schooling. They routinely measure whether students have learned important knowledge and skills, and they provide high-quality, useful information to students, parents, educators, and policymakers about achievement in core subjects.”
10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Innocent victims continue to die at the hands of private citizens with permits to carry concealed handguns… Concealed handgun permit holders are responsible for at least 928 deaths not involving self defense since 2007, including 31 mass shootings that killed 147 people… The findings of [our research] are consistent with the latest academic research, which shows that state laws allowing concealed handguns in public do not increase public safety – in fact, they do the opposite.”
10	Is Solar Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""Solar energy produces a small fraction of one percent of America's electricity and costs almost twice as much to produce as natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. If the 27 percent of U.S. electricity generated by natural gas came instead from solar power, consumer costs for monthly electric bills would increase about 25 percent...

Resolutions condemning Israel carry a nearly ritualistic quality at this point, yet blatant human rights abuses in other countries in the region (Saudi Arabia comes to mind) and around the world (China, anyone?) often appear to barely register on the official U.N. radar. The ongoing brutality in Syria provides an unfortunately apt example: While many member states have clearly wanted to take a stronger stand all along, for others the mere notion of harsh language was a bridge too far.   And that is wrong. That is wrong, and unfair, and frankly unhelpful to anyone wanting to build genuine, lasting peace anywhere in the world, not least Israel/Palestine."""

10	Does Legal Prostitution Lead to Human Trafficking and Slavery?	"""[C]riminalizing prostitution makes sex trafficking more likely. One widely recognized consequence of prohibition is the formation of cartels, which in a black market are more likely to use violence. This violence drives some producers out of the market, leading to higher prices and large criminal enterprises with monopoly power. Instead of breaking apart sex-trafficking rings, prohibition increases their profitability, making trafficking more appealing to criminal enterprises...   After legalizing prostitution in 2003, New Zealand found 'no incidence of human trafficking.' Moreover, legalization made it easier for sex workers to report abuse and for police to prosecute sex crimes."""

You've got political shortcuts and all these kind of things, that it's very important to have some kind of activity where you can say to people 'this is on the level.' You respect the rules, you respect your opponents, you respect yourself. You play fair. I think that bleeds over into life as well. I don't want my grandchildren to have to become chemical stockpiles in order to be good at sports and to have fun at it. Baseball, take your kid out to the ballpark some day and you say, 'Son, some day if you ingest enough of this sh[*!], you might be a player on that field, too.' It's a completely antithetical view to what sport should have been in the first place. It's essentially a humanistic endeavour to see how far you can go on your own talent."""

The consequences of continued increase of greenhouse gases extend far beyond extermination of species and future sea level rise...  Phase out of coal use except where the carbon is captured and stored below ground is the primary requirement for solving global warming.  Oil is used in vehicles where it is impractical to capture the carbon. But oil is running out. To preserve our planet we must also ensure that the next mobile energy source is not obtained by squeezing oil from coal, tar shale or other fossil fuels.  Fossil fuel reservoirs are finite, which is the main reason that prices are rising. We must move beyond fossil fuels eventually.

10	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""The death penalty has no deterrent effect. Claims that each execution deters a certain number of murders have been thoroughly discredited by social science research. People commit murders largely in the heat of passion, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or because they are mentally ill, giving little or no thought to the possible consequences of their acts. The few murderers who plan their crimes beforehand -- for example, professional executioners -- intend and expect to avoid punishment altogether by not getting caught.

01	Should Employers Who Unknowingly Hire Immigrants Who Are in the United States Illegally Receive Lighter Penalties?

We do not oppose efforts to increase penalties. However, the penalties need to be proportionate to the offense and comparable to other penalties in existence in the employment law arena... Penalties should not be inflexible, and we urge you to incorporate statutory language that allows enforcement agencies to mitigate penalties, rather than tying them to a specific, non-negotiable, dollar amount.  It is also critical to the employer community that it does not bear vicarious liability for subcontractor actions unless the contractor knew of the actions of the subcontractor...

01	Is Drinking Chocolate and Other Flavored Milks Healthy?	"""Flavored milks are as nutritious as unflavored milks. Both types of milk are nutrient dense foods containing a high proportion of essential nutrients in relation to their energy content. Chocolate milk, for example, provides the same essential nutrients as white milk, including calcium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, potassium, phosphorus, riboflavin, and niacin. Like unflavored milks, all versions of flavored milks provide 300mg calcium per serving or about one-third to one-fourth of children's daily calcium recommendation.  The main difference between flavored milk such as chocolate and unflavored milk is the 2 to 4 teaspoons more sugar (sucrose or high fructose corn syrup)... Intake of sugar may contribute to dental caries [tooth decay], but it is unlikely that flavored milks cause this disease. Flavored milks, being liquid, do not readily adhere to tooth surfaces. Also, components in flavored milks may protect against dental caries...  The minute amount of caffeine in chocolate milk, which is similar to the amount in decaffeinated coffee, is generally considered too small to affect most children's behavior or health."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Over three subsequent years, we find that binding minimum wage increases had significant, negative effects on the employment and income growth of targeted workers. Lost income reflects contributions from employment declines, increased probabilities of working without pay (i.e., an ‘internship’ effect), and lost wage growth associated with reductions in experience accumulation… Over the late 2000s, the average effective minimum wage rose by 30 percent across the United States. We estimate that these minimum wage increases reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by 0.7 percentage point… We find that binding minimum wage increases significantly reduced the likelihood that low-skilled workers rose to what we characterize as lower middle class earnings. This curtailment of transitions into lower middle class earnings began to emerge roughly one year following initial declines in low wage employment. Reductions in upward mobility thus appear to follow reductions in access to opportunities for accumulating work experience.”

These anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties make cannabis an option for ameliorating the daily suffering from common chronic pain conditions like arthritis and neuropathy, which decrease mobility and reduce quality of life. Access to cannabis for pain management is especially important for seniors because the pharmaceutical alternatives can be deadly.”

But scientific studies have yet to bear out the hopes of these desperate families. The truth is we lack evidence not only for the efficacy of marijuana, but also for its safety. This concern is especially relevant in children, for whom there is good evidence that marijuana use can increase the risk of serious psychiatric disorders and long-term cognitive problems. Where is the data showing that marijuana is effective for epilepsy? Although parents may report improvements in their children, it is important to remember that the placebo response is powerful, and the placebo response is greater in pediatric than adult studies. Before more children are exposed to potential risks, before more desperate families uproot themselves and spend their life savings on unproven miracle marijuana cures, we need objective data from randomized placebo-controlled trials.”
10	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""I shall discuss first, why the Court's oft repeated assertion that the government cannot favor religious practice is false...

The Supreme Court under John Marshall opened its sessions with the prayer, 'God save the United States and this Honorable Court.' The First Congress instituted the practice of beginning its legislative sessions with a prayer. The same week that Congress submitted the Establishment Clause as part of the Bill of Rights for ratification by the States, it enacted legislation providing for paid chaplains in the House and Senate. The day after the First Amendment was proposed, the same Congress that had proposed it requested the President to proclaim 'a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed, by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the many and signal favours of Almighty God.'...  The same Congress also reenacted the Northwest Territory Ordinance of 1787, 1 Stat. 50, Article III of which provided: 'Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.' And of course the First Amendment itself accords religion (and no other manner of belief) special constitutional protection.  These actions of our First President and Congress and the Marshall Court were not idiosyncratic; they reflected the beliefs of the period.

01	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""It would be much easier to eliminate the anti-doping rules than to eliminate doping. The current policy against doping has proved expensive and difficult to police. In the near future it may become impossible to police...   Because doping is illegal, the pressure is to make performance enhancers undetectable, rather than safe. Performance enhancers are produced or bought on the black market and administered in a clandestine, uncontrolled way with no monitoring of the athlete's health. Allowing the use of performance enhancers would make sport safer as there would be less pressure on athletes to take unsafe enhancers and a pressure to develop new safe performance enhancers and to make existing enhancers more effective at safe dosages...  The removal of doping controls would have major benefits: less cheating, increased solidarity and respect between athletes, more focus on sport and not on rules.  [I]n order to justify the current doping controls, these arguments have to justify the ban's yearly multi-million dollar cost, and the intangible costs, and they must outweigh the benefits we would get if we abolished doping controls. We should focus on health of athletes, not performance enhancement.  Rather than attempting to detect undetectable enhancers, we should spend our limited resources on evaluating health and fitness to compete. There are good reasons to allow performance enhancement, to make sport fairer (in the sense that the rules are equally applied) and to narrow the gap between the cheaters and the honest athletes. It would provide a better spectacle, be safer and less coercive."""
10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“GOLD IS back, what with libertarians the country over looking to force the government out of the business of monetary-policy making. How? Well, by bringing back the gold standard of course… Envisioning a statute requiring the Federal Reserve to redeem its notes for fixed amounts of specie [gold] is easy, but deciding what that fixed amount should be is hard. Set the price too high and there will be large amounts of gold-backed currency chasing limited supplies of goods and services. The new gold standard will then become an engine of precisely the inflation that its proponents abhor. But set the price too low, and the result will be deflation, which is not exactly a healthy state for an economy… Proponents of the gold standard thus face a Goldilocks problem: the porridge must be neither too hot nor too cold but just right. What temperature exactly, pray tell, might that be? And even if we are lucky enough to get it right at the outset, consider what happens subsequently. As the economy grows, the price level will have to fall. The same amount of gold-backed currency has to support a growing volume of transactions, something it can do only if the prices are lower, unless the supply of new gold by the mining industry magically rises at the same rate as the output of other goods and services. If not, prices go down, and real interest rates become higher. Investment becomes more expensive, rendering job creation more difficult all over again. Under a true gold standard, moreover, the Fed would have little ability to act as a lender of last resort to the banking and financial system. The kind of liquidity injections it made to prevent the financial system from collapsing in the autumn of 2008 would become impossible because it could provide additional credit only if it somehow came into possession of additional gold. Given the fragility of banks and financial markets, this would seem a recipe for disaster. Its proponents paint the gold standard as a guarantee of financial stability; in practice, it would be precisely the opposite.”

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	"Gold standards create periodic deflations and economic contractions which destabalize the economy. Under a gold standard, economic growth can outpace growth in the money supply since more money cannot be created and circulated until more gold is first obtained to back it. When this happens deflation and economic contraction occurs. Between 1913 and 1971, when the United States was on some form of a gold standard, there were 12 years when deflation occurred – the highest levels were in 1921 (-10.5%), 1931 (-9.0%), and 1932 (-9.9%). [10] According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, ""the length and depth of the deflation during the late 1920s and early 1930s strongly suggest a monetary origin, and the close correspondence... between deflation and nations' adherence to the gold standard.""

[7] John Mayer, PhD, clinical psychologist, stated, ""We are all bombarded with stress from everyday living, and with the nature of today’s world where information floods us constantly. It is hard to shut our minds down and tune out the stress and pressures. A binge can work like a steel door that blocks our brains from thinking about those constant stressors that force themselves into our thoughts."" [8] Binge-watching can also be healthy if the show relates to the viewer's real life. For example, a character could be a role model or solve a problem that the viewer is currently dealing with. The show might offer a sense of friendship and new solutions that could make someone's day-to-day life better. [8]"

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Human activities are changing Earth’s climate. At the global level, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat?trapping greenhouse gases have increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel burning dominates this increase. Human?caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8°C (1.5°F) over the past 140 years. Because natural processes cannot quickly remove some of these gases (notably carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere, our past, present, and future emissions will influence the climate system for millennia. Extensive, independent observations confirm the reality of global warming. These observations show large?scale increases in air and sea temperatures, sea level, and atmospheric water vapor; they document decreases in the extent of mountain glaciers, snow cover, permafrost, and Arctic sea ice. These changes are broadly consistent with long? understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human?caused increases in greenhouse gases. The changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences.”
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“The recommendation that birth control be available over-the-counter supports what we know about Latinas and contraception: over-the-counter access will greatly reduce the systemic barriers, like poverty, immigration status and language, that currently prevent Latinas from regularly accessing birth control and results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy. Over-the-counter birth control will enable more Latinas to plan the timing and spacing of their families, particularly immigrant Latinas who are expressly barred from accessing benefits under the Affordable Care Act. It’s time for affordable, highly effective oral contraception to be over-the-counter and available alongside condoms and cough medicine.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""[Capital punishment] violates the Eighth Amendment because it is morally unacceptable to the people of the United States at this time in their history. In judging whether or not a given penalty is morally acceptable, most courts have said that the punishment is valid unless 'it shocks the conscience and sense of justice of the people.' Assuming knowledge of all the facts presently available regarding capital punishment, the average citizen would, in my opinion, find it shocking to his conscience and sense of justice. For this reason alone, capital punishment cannot stand."""

With 33 percent of potential voters easily located in one place, local candidates are going to spend a lot of time campaigning at the prison.  Then there is the moral side of the issue. Why is it in the interests of women that rapists should have a say in deciding who will win elections?

01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“Standardized tests provide a clear solution to the challenges posed by NCLB. A standardized test, such as the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Tenth Edition [published by Pearson], is carefully designed for consistency of format, content, and administration procedure. The reliability of a standardized test is verified by statistical evidence gathered by the test publisher during national studies in which representative groups of students take the test under standardized conditions… Despite the substantial amount of development effort required, a well-designed standardized test offers a relatively affordable and efficient way of measuring the achievement of a large number of students. When a high-stakes test must be selected to inform decisions that affect the future of a single student or an entire school district, standardized tests that are proven to be reliable, valid, and fair offer the best option for measuring levels of student achievement.”
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Direct-to-consumer marketing of prescription drugs should be prohibited… Pharmaceutical advertising does not promote public health. It increases the cost of drugs and the number of unnecessary prescriptions, which is expensive to taxpayers, and can be harmful or deadly to patients… Prescription drug advertising pressures health professionals to prescribe particular medications, and often the ones that may be less effective and more expensive and dangerous. This intrudes in the relationship between medical professionals and patients, and disrupts the therapeutic process. It takes up valuable time to explain to patients why they may have been misled by the drug advertisements they have seen. Prescription drug advertising is not educational. It is inherently misleading because it features emotive imagery and omits crucial information about drugs and their proper use, as well as about side effects and contraindications that can be found on the full FDA-approved label. Drug companies have an inherent and irredeemable financial conflict-of-interest which drives them to exaggerate the positive and minimize the negative qualities of their own products.”
01	Is it legal for Congressional representatives to trade securities based on insider information?	"""Members of Congress and their staffs are effectively considered exempt from many of the laws they define for the rest of us, and from executive-branch regulation. We ask our legislators to share power with the executive branch, and that means we do not let the latter rule over the former. Thus the Securities and Exchange Commission has a Division of Enforcement to go after private-sector insider trading (among other crimes), but the SEC cannot touch members of congress. A former senior counsel with the SEC's Enforcement Division says of congressional insider trading, 'It may be unethical, and it may be unseemly, but it's not illegal.' The four- and five-hundred-page House and Senate ethics manuals are silent on the matter of insider trading. The idea of using market-moving, inside-government information and trading stocks based on that information is simply not mentioned...  In other words, when a member of Congress trades stock based on information not yet shared with the public but revealed to him as part of congressional business, it is legal."""
10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	Using tablets is more expensive than using print textbooks. Implementing tablets in K-12 schools requires purchasing hardware (the tablet) and software (the textbooks), building new wi-fi infrastructure, and training teachers and administrators how to use the technology. Implementation costs for e-textbooks on iPad tablets are 552% higher than new print textbooks in an average high school.

The only countries with higher hip fracture rates are Australia, New Zealand and those in Europe where they consume even more milk than the United States. Evidence for this was provided by Yale University School of Medicine researchers who summarized the data on protein consumption and bone fracture rates from 34 separate surveys in 16 countries...   Further support for the strong association between milk consumption and osteoporosis was provided by a study of 1,000 women aged 64 and up over a seven-year period conducted by scientists from the University of California at San Francisco... The women with the highest ratio of animal protein to plant protein had 3.7 times more bone fractures than the women with lowest ratio. Likewise, the women with the high ratio lost bone almost four times as fast as the women with the lowest ratio.   These observations therefore contradict the common wisdom that protein-rich foods especially milk protect our bones."""

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""As civil libertarians, we believe the government should not throw consenting adults in jail for private sexual conduct.

As advocates for equality, we know that anti-sex work laws disproportionately target women along with LGBTQ people, young people and people of color, all of whom are overrepresented in the sex industry and at highest risk of arrest. Systemic discrimination can factor into the decision to participate in sex work. In the face of job discrimination, no viable alternatives for earning a living, ejection from school, eviction from housing or ostracism from your family for your gender identity or sexual orientation, sex work may offer one of the more stabilizing and accessible ways to support yourself and your family. As criminal justice reformers, we see laws criminalizing sex work as another way of misdirecting law enforcement resources and expanding our unjust system of mass incarceration. Scarce tax dollars underwrite people's arrests and imprisonment for consensual activity. In addition to criminal records, arrests for sex work come with devastating collateral consequences, including eviction, loss of child custody and deportation."""

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Why do we make young people wait until 21 to drink alcohol?Many activities have ages of initiation… The age limit for alcohol is based on research which shows that young people react differently to alcohol. Teens get drunk twice as fast as adults, but have more trouble knowing when to stop. Teens naturally overdo it and binge more often than adults. Enforcing the legal drinking age of 21 reduces traffic crashes, protects young people’s maturing brains, and keeps young people safer overall. Can’t parents teach their teens how to drink alcohol responsibly by giving them small amounts—under supervision—before they reach 21?Some states permit parents to do this with their own child, but there’s no evidence that this approach actually works. As matter of fact, there is evidence to contrary. When teens feel they have their parents’ approval to drink, they do it more and more often when they are not with their parents. When parents have concrete, enforced rules about alcohol, young people binge drink less. Would lowering the legal drinking age make alcohol less of a big deal, and less attractive to teens?History says no. When states had lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., the underage drinking problem was worse. For example, before the 21 minimum legal drinking age was implemented by all states, underage drunk drivers were involved in over twice as many fatal traffic crashes as today. I thought Europeans have fewer underage drinking problems … is it because their kids drink from an earlier age?That’s a myth. European countries have worse problems than America does, as far as binge drinking and drinking to intoxication. Studies show that Europe has more underage drunkenness, injury, rape, and school problems due to alcohol. Since alcohol is more available there, it actually increases the proportion of kids who drink in Europe. Drinking is just a phase all kids go through; they’ll grow out of it.Actually, many don’t. In fact, the earlier someone begins drinking, the more likely they are to be alcohol dependent in later life. More than 40 percent of individuals who start drinking before the age of 13 will develop alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. Ninety-five percent of the 14 million people who are alcohol dependent began drinking before the legal age of 21.”

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol. Alcohol affects the development of the brain, which continues to form and mature throughout adolescence. Young people also have a propensity to combine high-risk drinking with other high-risk activities, increasing the potential for accidental injury both to themselves and to others. The harmful effects of alcohol on young people raises questions about the adequacy of current policies in appropriately curbing access to and use of alcohol by youth… When New Zealand reduced its minimum purchase age for alcohol from 20 to 18 in 1997, there was a 12 per cent increase in the rate of traffic crashes and injuries for 18–19 year-old males, and a 14 per cent increase among 15–17 year-old males. Accident rates among young female drivers rose 51 per cent for 18–19 year olds and 24 per cent for 15–17 year olds. There was also a significant increase in hospital presentations of intoxicated people under 20… Studies conducted around the world support the New Zealand experience outlined above regarding changes to the minimum purchase age for alcohol. A review of the empirical research from 1960 to 2000 shows that almost 60 per cent of high-quality studies undertaken concluded that a higher minimum purchase age for alcohol was associated with reduced road traffic accidents. None found the opposite. This well-documented relationship strongly implies that increasing the minimum purchase age for alcohol can potentially save lives by reducing the incidence of road traffic accidents among young drivers, not to mention the long-term impact of serious injury.”

However, marijuana smoke also contains cannabinoids such as THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol), which are non-carcinogenic and demonstrate anti-cancer properties in vivo and in vitro… Cannabis smoke — unlike tobacco smoke — has not been definitely linked to cancer in humans, including those cancers associated with tobacco use. However, certain cellular abnormalities in the lungs have been identified more frequently in long-term smokers of cannabis compared to non-smokers. Chronic exposure to cannabis smoke has also been associated with the development of pre-cancerous changes in bronchial and epithelium cells in similar rates to tobacco smokers. Cellular abnormalities were most present in individuals who smoked both tobacco and marijuana, implying that cannabis and tobacco smoke may have an additive adverse effect on airway tissue… However, to date, no epidemiologic studies of cannabis-only smokers have yet to reveal such a finding. Larger, better-controlled studies are warranted.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""In a free market, cost dictates energy choices. Fossil fuels, for example, are economically attractive for many applications because the energy available from fossil fuels is highly concentrated, easily transportable, and cheaply extracted. Renewable energies such as wind and solar power, on the other hand, are relatively dispersed, difficult to transport, and costly to harness given the capital costs of facility construction.  Many people recommend accelerated federal subsidies and preferences for renewable energy in order to reduce America's dependence on imported oil. But such recommendations fail to appreciate the fact that energy sources are often difficult to substitute for one another. Until we see major technological advances in electric-powered vehicles and related battery systems, for example, technological breakthroughs in solar or wind power will have little, if any, impact on oil imports. That's because renewable energy is used primarily to generate electricity and cannot be used directly in transportation to replace oil: in 2002, only 2.5 percent of America's total electricity was generated from oil combustion."""

CO2 is also found in natural gas reservoirs, where it has resided for millions of years. Thus, evidence suggests that depleting or depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and similar 'capped' sandstone formations containing saltwater that cannot be made potable, are capable of storing CO2 for millennia or longer...

Yet for all that exposure to foreign citizens, money, and ideas, the power of the Castro brothers is undiminished. By the same token, if international commerce had the power to undo the regime, wouldn’t it have been undone by now? The US embargo, after all, doesn’t stop Cuba from trading with any other country in the world. Indeed, even with the ’embargo,’ the United States is one of Cuba’s top five trading partners… As long as the Castros maintain their stranglehold on the Cuban economy, enriching that economy enriches — and entrenches — them.

01	Should the US Use Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) to Extract Natural Gas?	"""I believe that there is enough domestic gas to meet our needs for the foreseeable future thanks to technological advances in hydraulic fracturing. According to IHS, a business-information company in Douglas County, Colorado, the estimated recoverable gas from US shale source rocks using fracking is about 42 trillion cubic metres, almost equal to the total conventional gas discovered in the United States over the past 150 years, and equivalent to about 65 times the current US annual consumption. During the past three years, about 50 billion barrels of additional recoverable oil have been found in shale oil deposits — more than 20% of the total conventional recoverable US oil resource. These 'tight' oil resources, which also require fracking to access, could generate 3 million barrels a day by 2020, offsetting one-third of current oil imports. International data aren't as well known, but the effect of fracking on global energy production will be huge.  Global warming is a serious issue that fracking-related gas production can help to alleviate... Mankind's inexorable march towards 9 billion people will require a broad portfolio of energy resources, which can be gained only with breakthroughs such as fracking...  Global warming aside, there is no compelling environmental reason to ban hydraulic fracturing. There are environmental risks, but these can be managed through existing, and rapidly improving, technologies and regulations. It might be nice to have moratoria after each breakthrough to study the consequences (including the disposal of old batteries or radioactive waste), but because energy expenditure and economic health are so closely linked, global moratoria are not practical.  The gains in employment, economics and national security, combined with the potential to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions if natural gas is managed properly, make a compelling case."""
01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	Crime: The crime rate fell every year that Clinton was president and was at a 26-year low by the end of his two terms. He got funding for 100,000 new police officers nationwide. He signed the 1993 Brady Bill requiring a waiting period and background check to purchase handguns. Clinton's 1994 Crime Bill included a ban on assault weapons, and there was a 40 percent decline in gun crime by 2001. [8] Read More
10	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""Converting the grasslands of the U.S. to grow corn results in excess greenhouse gas emissions of 134 metric tons of CO2 per hectare - a debt that would take 93 years to repay by replacing gasoline with corn-based ethanol. And converting jungles to palm plantations or tropical rainforest to soy fields would take centuries to pay back their carbon debts...  Ethanol demand in the U.S., for example, has caused some farmers to plant more corn and less soy. This has driven up soy prices causing farmers in Brazil to clear more Amazon rainforest land to plant valuable soy...Because a soy field contains far less carbon than a rainforest, the greenhouse gas benefit of the original ethanol is wiped out."""

10	Is a College Education Worth It?	Many students do not graduate and waste their own and their government’s money. About 19% of students who enroll in college do not return for the second year. [117] Overall, 41% of students at four-year colleges and universities did not graduate within six years: 41% at public schools, 34% at private non-profits, and 77% at private for-profits. [117] The federal government allocated $176.83 billion for college loans, grants, tax benefits, and work studies in 2013. [48] State governments spent $81.2 billion supporting public colleges in 2012. [49] Students who started bachelor's degrees in the fall of 2002 but did not graduate within six years accounted for $3.8 billion in lost income, $566 million in lost federal income taxes, and $164 million in lost state income taxes in one year. [50] The government gets fewer tax dollars from non-college graduates than from college graduates who have higher wages. [50] Students who drop out during the first year of college cost states $1.3 billion and the federal government $300 million per year in wasted student grant programs and government appropriations for colleges.

01	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Glaucoma?	ability of cannabis and THC to lower intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma was serendipitously discovered in the late 1970’s by a variety of patients and researchers. Several patients in the US Compassionate Use Investigational New Drug Program maintained their vision while employing large amounts of daily cannabis in situations where standard drug therapy failed… An emerging concept is that glaucoma represents a progressive vascular retinopathy that requires a neuroprotectant to preserve vision. Some of the resulting optic nerve damage accrues due to NMDA hyperexcitability, an effect that THC and CBD may counter as neuroprotective antioxidants. Thus, glaucoma is an area where cannabis and cannabinoids may offer particular advantages over available single ingredient ocular anti-hypertensive agents.”

10	Does Drinking Milk Reduce the Symptoms of PMS?	"""A nutritional survey of 14 normal women and 39 PMTS [premenstrual tension syndromes such as PMT-A] patients revealed a significant difference in the consumption of some macronutrients. The PMTS patients consumed more refined sugar, refined carbohydrates and dairy products than did the normal women. Women with PMT-A [anxiety, irritability and nervous tension] symptoms consumed more protein, more dairy products and more refined sugar than did PMTS patients without PMT-A...  Low red cell magnesium levels have been found in PMTS patients. In an open trial of 192 PMTS patients, magnesium supplementation during the week preceding menses significantly improved nervous tension, mastalgia and weight gain in 89-96% of the patients.  PMT-A patients consume excessive amounts of calcium, mainly from dairy products. Since calcium interferes with the absorption and utilization of magnesium and other nutrients and the main source of calcium in PMTS patients is dairy products, our dietary goal is to lower the intake of dairy products and increase the magnesium and potassium intake from vegetable sources. Limitation, but not restriction, of sodium is also advised."""

To this end, we are committed to safe nuclear power and to deploying advanced technologies...  There is no silver bullet that will immediately solve our energy challenges, or drastically reduce costs at the gas pump. But we need to work together and answer the President's call to increase domestic exploration, expand our nuclear infrastructure as well as solve our long-term nuclear waste storage challenge."""

As a result, I became known as 'the hanging judge of Orange County,' an appellation that, I will confess, I accepted with some pride.   I can live with it and, apparently, so can the men I condemned. The first one, Rodney James Alcala, whom I sentenced to die more than 30 years ago for kidnapping and killing 12-year-old Robin Samsoe, was, just last year, again sentenced to death for killing Samsoe and four other young women who, it has subsequently been determined, were his victims around the same time...  Had I known then what I know now, I would have given Alcala and the others the alternative sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Had I done that, Robin's mother, Marianne, would have been spared the pain of 30 appeals and writs and retrial. She could have dealt then and there with the fact that her daughter's killer would be shut away, never again to see a day of freedom, and gone on to put her life together. And the people of California would have not have had to pay many millions of tax dollars in this meaningless and ultimately fruitless pursuit of death.  It's time to stop playing the killing game.

01	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	deferring to the DEA, your release reads that, ‘FDA is the sole federal agency that approves drug products as safe and effective for intended indications.’ Why then has the FDA failed to respond to the 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report which concluded that marijuana’s active components are potentially effective in treating pain, nausea, the anorexia of AIDS wasting, and other symptoms, and should be tested rigorously in clinical trials? It perplexes us that even though the FDA is responsible for protecting public health, the agency has failed to respond adequately to the IOM’s findings seven years after the study’s publication date. Additionally, this release failed to make note of the FDA’s Investigational New Drug (IND) Compassionate Access Program, which allowed patients with certain medical conditions to apply with the FDA to receive federal marijuana. Currently, seven people still enlisted in this program continue to receive marijuana through the federal government. The existence of this program is an example of how the FDA could allow for the legal use of a drug, such as medical marijuana, without going through the ‘well-controlled’ series of steps that other drugs have to go through if there is a compassionate need.”

Women's-rights activists believe the German government's sanctioning of sex services for World Cup visitors will drive the illicit international trade in sex trafficking.

Sanctuary policies are an exercise of basic state and local powers to regulate for the health, safety and welfare of their residents. Some entities have acted out of a moral objection to mass deportations, but that is rarely the only motivation. Many local leaders recognize that sanctuary policies are vital to preserving police-community relations and ensuring that residents feel safe reporting crimes and accessing basic government services. Still others are responding to the risk that collaboration with federal immigration officials could lead to racial profiling and civil liberties violations.

01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“[W]e can conclude for several reasons that drones are the best alternative, once the United States… decides that a person is to be killed. The tribal areas are governed by the colonial-era Frontier Crimes Regulation rather than Pakistan’s constitution. Because of this, there are no police forces in the area, but rather militias, paramilitary and military forces. Americans could not therefore detain suspects without ground operations. Alternatives are more deadly and devastating: Pakistani military operations, which are not precise and have displaced up to 4 million people, devastate infrastructure and displace whole communities. And while Pakistan helps the United States in some operations it undermines the United States in others. For this reason, the United States cannot simply outsource such an assignment to Pakistan because there have been too many cases where the Pakistanis have alerted the targets in advance. Drones may not be the desirable, but they are the best option at least in the tribal areas.”

"""Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced from plants, unlike petroleum-based fossil fuels that have a limited supply and are the major contributor of carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas.  FACT: Using ethanol in place of gasoline helps to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 29% given today's technology.  Because ethanol is made from renewable, plant-based feedstocks, the CO2 released during a vehicle's fuel combustion is 'recycled' by the plant as it grows (photosynthesis). New technologies, additional feedstocks, and higher blends of ethanol including E85 all promise greater CO2 reductions. In 2007, ethanol use in the U.S. reduced CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 10.1 million tons, equal to removing more than 1.5 million cars from America's roadways."""

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""One cannot support the reduction of AIDS infections and support legal prostitution at the same time. Prostitution remains one of the leading vectors for AIDS infection. This is true in the case of both legal and illegal prostitution...   Prostitutes, because of their many partners, have a greatly increased risk of exposure to HIV. They are likewise able to spread HIV to many other partners...  The redefinition of prostitution as 'commercial sex work' is just an attempt to legitimize sex trafficking. It should come as no surprise the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have signed on. While both groups are considered 'pro-woman', it is odd that they support an industry of flagrant abuse of women...  There are a multitude of studies to show the high level of abuse that prostitutes suffer. Women are literally bought and sold as property. The incidence of drug addiction is high among women, partially explaining why they became prostitutes to begin with.  The argument for legalization goes something like this. Prostitution will happen anyway but legalization and regulation will help stem the abuses. The argument has 50,000 foot appeal. Using the same logic, slavery (which still exists in many places) should be legalized so underground slaves can be given some measure of human rights. The fact that the ACLU and the bevy of left-wing international groups don't argue for the legalization of slavery shows the logical inconsistency of their position.  Further, the legalization of abortion has shown that it lead to a radical increase in abortion. The legalization will lead to an untold number of women being forced into sex slavery. Make no mistake, women will be forced into commercial sex work in greater numbers if it were legalized."""

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Over-the-counter birth control would be more affordable. Moving the Pill over-the-counter would eliminate the insurance companies as middle-man between women and the Pill, thus making the drugs less expensive. Jeffrey A Singer, MD, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, noted that moving birth control to OTC status could make the Pill less expensive by selling the drug directly to consumers rather than through third-party insurance companies that inflate the prices. [38] Getting birth control by prescription has several associated costs that would be eliminated with OTC status, including co-pays for doctor’s visits and time taken off work to go to the doctor. [38] Uninsured women may also save money by eliminating the insurance companies as middle-man. Uninsured women, about 11% of US women ages 19 to 64, paid $370 on average for a year’s worth of Pills (about $30.83 per month), which was 68% of their total healthcare spending for the year, and about 51 hours of work for someone making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

10	Police Body Cameras: Top 3 Pros and Cons	Police body cameras are too expensive and are unreliable. Equipping police departments with body cameras is extremely expensive as forces have to budget not only for the camera but also for ancillary equipment, training, data storage facilities, extra staff to manage the video data, and maintenance costs. [26] To equip the Bakersfield Police Department, a force of 200 officers, would cost an estimated $440,000 in the first year, and $240,000 in subsequent years. [24] In Philadelphia, a four-year deal to equip a department of over 4,000 officers cost $12.5 million. [25] Police departments in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and Utah have suspended body-worn camera programs citing rising costs. [27][28][29][30] A trial in Edmonton, CA, found that body-worn cameras had an insufficient battery length for every day policing, especially in cold weather where battery life diminished more quickly. [9] A sheriff's office in Virginia has stopped using body cameras due to the unreliability of their on-off buttons and poor integration with their IT systems. [31]
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates due to global warming, causing additional climate changes. About a quarter of the globe's glacial loss from 1851-2010, and approximately two thirds of glacial loss between 1991-2010, is attributable directly to global warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases. [45] According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, global warming from human-produced greenhouse gases is a primary cause of the ""unprecedented"" retreat of glaciers around the world since the early 20th century. [44] Since 1980 glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness. [110] According to a 2013 IPCC report, ""glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide"" over the prior two decades, and there is ""high confidence"" (about an 8 out of 10 chance) that Northern Hemisphere spring snow continues to decrease. [29] If the glaciers forming the Greenland ice sheet were to melt entirely, global sea levels could increase by up to 20 feet. [168] Melting glaciers also change the climate of the surrounding region. With the loss of summer glacial melt water, the temperatures in rivers and lakes increase. According to the US Geological Service, this disruption can include the ""extinction of temperature sensitive aquatic species."" [169] Read More"
10	Did Electronic Voting Machines in the 2000 and 2004 Elections Give an Advantage to a Particular Political Party or a Candidate from a Particular Party?	"""The recent working paper by Hout, Mangels, Carlson and Best ('HMCB') concludes that 'electronic voting raised President Bush's advantage from the tiny edge he held in 2000 to a clearer margin of victory in 2004.'... We conclude that the [HMCB] study is entirely without merit and its 'results' are meaningless...  HMCB's concept of 'excess votes' is empirically meaningless, they did not uncover statistical irregularities associated with the electronic voting machines used in Florida. We have shown that HMCB were not modelling increases for support for President Bush between 2000 and 2004, but instead were only modelling support for Bush in 2004. Therefore, there can be no evidence that counties with electronic voting machines were significantly likely to show increases in support for President Bush between 2000 and 2004... In their summary, HMCB claim that 'We can be 99.9% sure that these effects are not attributable to chance.' We respectfully disagree: we are 99.99% sure that HMCB's paper constitutes no evidence that there was anything amiss with the electronic voting in Florida."""

10	Is There a Moral Difference between Passive Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""It has been widely remarked that passive euthanasia is relatively common in our hospitals (or in the homes of patients), and doctors do not all that reluctantly shy away from conceding that they take part in withdrawing treatment at the request of terminally ill patients. Yet...few doctors indeed concede that they supply, at the request of their terminally ill patients, pills that produce death. In the former case, the patient is on a life-support system, which the doctor may permissibly, at the request of the patient, withdraw; in the latter case, the patient is not on a life-support system, and the doctor may not permissibly, at the request of the patient, supply pills that produce death. It seems little short of incredible that the fact that a terminally ill patient is or is not on a life-support system could so transform cases, morally, when both cases show quite clearly that patient and doctor are acting together to bring about the patient's death at the instigation of the patient...  Withdrawing feeding tubes and starving the patient to death is permissible, supplying the patient with a pill that produces death is not. Yet both sorts of assistance assuredly produce death, and both sorts involve the patient and doctor acting together to produce that death.

Despite 20 years of this fiction, two decades of dreamers, cynics, Israel lobbyists, politicians, journalists, officials, liberal Zionists and pundits pronouncing the two-state solution the only game in town, it's over. Finished. Israel killed it by pursuing its natural Zionist, expansionist tendencies. The result is that Israel has succeeded in conquering the West Bank but ended its chances of remaining a Jewish state… The only viable alternative, and one gaining increasing traction, is the one-state solution… A one-state equation isn't about dismissing or ignoring Jewish history, but recognising the land is shared between two peoples and a soon-to-be minority Jewish population has no legal or ethical right to control a majority Arab people.  On its current path, despite some mainstream Israeli politicians advocating the illegal annexation of the West Bank to create an indefinite apartheid state, Israel will become increasingly ghettoised and militarised, convincing once-proud diaspora supporters to decide between their morality and Zionist loyalties.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""When the arguments of deterrence and incapacitation fall away, one is left with a more deep-seated justification for the death penalty: that of just retribution for the particular crime committed. According to this argument, certain people deserve to be killed as repayment for the evil done: there are crimes so offensive that killing the offender is the only just response.  It is an emotionally powerful argument. It is also one which, if valid, would invalidate the basis for human rights. If a person who commits a terrible act can 'deserve' the cruelty of death, why cannot others, for similar reasons, 'deserve' to be tortured or imprisoned without trial or simply shot on sight? Central to fundamental human rights is that they are inalienable. They may not be taken away even if a person has committed the most atrocious of crimes. Human rights apply to the worst of us as well as to the best of us, which is why they protect all of us.  What the argument for retribution boils down to, is often no more than a desire for vengeance masked as a principle of justice. The desire for vengeance can be understood and acknowledged but the exercise of vengeance must be resisted. The history of the endeavour to establish the rule of law is a history of the progressive restriction of personal vengeance in public policy and legal codes."""

And I've seen the child die half an hour later. You see, in a liberal society, a woman's right to choose works both ways.   The reverse of mercy killing is not life, but a life of suffering...Killing is wrong, but so is torture. An adult patient who is compos mentis [of sound mind] who requests euthanasia considers life (such as he can live it) to be a fate worse than death...   There are always a few very unlucky innocent children who suffer from the most terrible afflictions. They usually die at an early age, after a few years of intense suffering. As with all children, their parents are entitled to withhold any treatment from their children, even life-saving treatment. After all, the parents are the child's legal guardians, and children's lives are routinely put in jeopardy by religious parents who refuse them vaccinations or blood transfusions. However, in these cases, even though withholding treatment would lead to a quicker death, it would also increase the suffering of the child. Actively ending the child's life would be painless. The temptation for mercy killing is there and has always been there. It is a fact of life. Like with euthanasia, mercy killing of suffering infants will not go away when you prohibit it. You can even ask yourself if there will be more mercy killings when you legalize it. Considering the rarity of these illnesses, the strictness of the [Groningen] protocol, and the commonness and strength of parental love, I really doubt that.   Better to have it out in the open where people like yourself can scrutinize the process, then to have parents, doctors and nurses risk years in prison for committing something they and many others see as a selfless act of mercy."""
01	Does Ethanol Generate More Energy Than the Amount Needed to Produce It?	"""To be a viable substitute for a fossil fuel, an alternative fuel should...provide a net energy gain over the energy sources used to produce it.  Biofuel production requires energy to grow crops and convert them to biofuels. We estimate farm energy use...including energy use for growing the hybrid or varietal seed planted to produce the crop, powering farm machinery, producing farm machinery and buildings, producing fertilizers and pesticides, and sustaining farmers and their households. We also estimate the energy used in converting crops to biofuels, including energy use in transporting the crops to biofuel production facilities, building and operating biofuel production facilities, and sustaining production facility workers and their households...  In short, we find no support for the assertion that either biofuel [corn ethanol or soy biodiesel] requires more energy to make than it yields. However, the NEB [net energy balance] for corn grain ethanol is small, providing ~25% more energy than required for its production. Almost all of this NEB is attributable to the energy credit for its DDGS [distillers' dry grain with solubles] coproduct, which is animal feed, rather than to the ethanol itself containing more energy than used in its production. Corn grain ethanol has a low NEB because of the high energy input required to produce corn and to convert it into ethanol."""
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?

The Uniform Drinking Act, which compelled states to set the legal drinking age at 21 by withholding ten percent of highway funding from states that kept the minimum legal drinking age at 18, is an example of federal government overreach into state affairs. Many states that were happy with their MLDA 18 bowed to federal pressure rather than lose millions in annual highway funds. [15] Read More

There remain holdouts who complain that the ACA is an infringement of 'freedom.' That's true only under a bizarro-world definition of 'freedom.'

Indeed, many of the voter-disenfranchisement laws in this country were passed long before blacks could even vote...   The Obama administration would rather focus on white racism instead of black behavior. But before Republicans follow along, they might consider how these liberal policies impact the law-abiding members of the black community so often ignored by the left. Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for drug dealers means that these thugs return to the ghetto sooner rather than later to raise hell.

"""[D]isenfranchised felons are unequal parties to a contract that is fundamentally unfair in its formation on the grounds that they are unconscionable...

In fact, active citizenship in the United States is but a façade without this vital right.  The felon, disenfranchised upon breaching the original social contract, enters into a second contract upon his release. The validity of this second formation is questionable because the felon, in his disenfranchised state, is not an equal party truly free to contract. This suggests that the contract is unconscionable because of the unincarcerated felon's unequal position as a silent party to the ongoing negotiation of the contract...  The social contract suffers from many of the ailments in the formation, liquidated damages provision, and unconscionable terms that would invalidate any traditional contract... the franchise should be returned to unincarcerated felons so that they may be whole and free parties to the social contract."""

In Johnson v. Bush, a federal appeals court dismissed those claims, noting that 'criminal disenfranchisement provisions have existed as a punitive device' throughout history.  People truly concerned with the well-being of felons and their successful reintegration into the civil society would want the type of system Florida has.

And I point out here the data on suicide among gay and lesbian teens which is about three times that of the general teenage population. Same-sex marriages provide stability for couples in terms of public acknowledgment of their commitment and provide legitimacy for the children being raised by gay and lesbian parents.

However, legitimate medications containing marijuana components have proven effective in relieving the symptoms of some medical conditions… In light of the need for research-based evidence, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in January 1997 to review all scientific evidence concerning the medical use of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids… The IOM study concluded that there is little future in smoked marijuana as medication. Although marijuana smoke delivers THC and other cannabinoids to the body, it also contains harmful substances, including most of those found in tobacco smoke. The long-term harms from smoking make it a poor drug delivery system, particularly for pregnant women and patients with chronic diseases. In addition, cannabis contains a variable mixture of biologically active compounds. Even in cases where marijuana can provide symptomatic relief, the crude plant does not meet the modern expectation that medicines be of known quality and composition. Nor can smoked tmarijuana guarantee precise dosage. If there is any future for cannabinoid medications, it lies with agents of certain composition and delivery systems that permit controlled doses.”

01	Is Drinking Non-Homogenized Milk Healthier Than Drinking Homogenized Milk?	"""So what's the harm in homogenization? Cow's milk contains an enzyme of large molecular size called xanthine oxidase (XO). XO is normally attached to the fat globules in milk. However, when these fat globules are in their natural large-sized state prior to homogenization, they are not easily absorbed by the gut wall. After homogenization, the milk fat is easily absorbed, and the attached XO gains much greater access to the bloodstream.   Some researchers [such as Dr. Kurt Oster and Dr. Donald Ross] have asserted that XO, after getting into the bloodstream, directly promotes hardening of the arteries by replacing a substance called plasmalogen that is normally found there. The research supporting this connection between XO and hardening of the arteries is not clear-cut, but whether or not there is a definite cause-and-effect relationship between the two should not be a critical factor in deciding whether you should drink milk. This possible XO link to heart disease is but one more potential connection of milk to disease and premature death."""
10	Is There a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Many remain unconvinced that there is any significant moral difference between the two [voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS)] and advance a number of counter-arguments. First, they argue that the supposed greater degree of patient control in cases of PAS is overstated...  Secondly, if one of the main moral arguments advanced by campaigners for PAS is respect for the autonomous request of a suffering patient, why should the patient's autonomous request for VAE not carry equal weight? Why should a patient who wants the doctor to administer a lethal injection (and a doctor who wants to comply) not have their autonomy respected?...  Thirdly, the physical difference between intentionally ending the patient's life, and intentionally helping the patient to end his or her own life, can be negligible. What, for example, is the supposed difference between a doctor handing a lethal pill to a patient; placing the pill on the patient's tongue; and dropping it down the patient's throat? Where does PAS end and VAE begin? It is easy to see why many conclude that the supposed distinction between PAS and VAE, even when it can be drawn in the physical world, has little significance (if any) in the moral world. """

The revolving-door effect of restoring felons' rights only then to revoke them due to a new criminal offense would diminish the integrity of our democratic government and the rule of law. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, nearly 40 percent of offenders commit another crime within three years of release and 45 percent do so within five years...  Rather than automatically restore rights to violent repeat offenders, we should ensure fairness in the clemency process by immediately eliminating the backlog, as I previously proposed.

10	Is Drinking Milk the Best Way for People to Incorporate Calcium into Their Diet?	"""Dairy products contain nutrients, including protein, sodium, and, in some cases, supplemental vitamin D, all of which influence calcium balance and bone mineralization and alter or negate the effect of dairy calcium in the body's mineral economy. Animal protein and sodium, in particular, tend to increase calcium excretion...  We found no evidence to support the notion that milk is a preferred source of calcium... Although milk and other dairy products are reliable sources of calcium, many factors affect the availability and retention of the calcium from these products. For example, the calcium in dairy products is not as well absorbed as that in many dark green leafy vegetables but has an absorption fraction similar to that of calcium supplements, calcium-enriched beverages, calcium-set tofu, sweet potatoes, and beans. Dairy products... clearly increase the urinary excretion of calcium as a result of their increased sodium, sulfur-containing amino acid, and phosphorus content."""

It is nonsensical to oppose the use of medical marijuana in the midst of what amounts to a nationwide epidemic of opioid addiction. Why not provide patients with a safer option?

The report further states that specific hurricanes, including Sandy, Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and Ike, were not a direct consequence of human-caused global warming. [89] Between 1995-2015 increased hurricane activity (including Katrina) was recorded, however, according to the NOAA, it was not the result of human-induced climate change; it was the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents.

Like the existing Keystone pipeline that has safely transported more than 700 million barrels of the same oil to U.S. refineries since 2010, the Canadian and American oil transported along Keystone XL will stay in the U.S. and be refined into products we need like gasoline, diesel, pharmaceuticals, medical devices like heart valves, other plastics and countless other items. Those who argue this pipeline is for export are not being factual. Why on earth would Canadian and U.S. companies pay to ship their oil to Gulf Coast refineries, then pay again to ship that same oil overseas, only to pass tankers bringing millions of barrels of oil into America? It just doesn't make any sense...  Like the 14,000 construction jobs that were created to build the existing Keystone system, there should be no discounting that for the nearly 9,000 men and women who will ply their trades to build this project and more than 42,000 in total across the American supply chain, these jobs are very real and meaningful...  We can't think of an initiative that better embodies the historically strong Canada/U.S. trading partnership than an $8 billion private sector project – one built with the hands of Americans and Canadians, transporting Canadian and American oil to be used to fuel the everyday lives of the American people.

01	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""The environmental systems on which all life depends are being threatened locally, regionally, and at a planetary level by human actions...  Linkages between energy use and environmental quality have always been apparent, from the deforestation caused by fuelwood use even in early societies to the high levels of local air and water pollution that have commonly accompanied the early phases of industrialization...  [C]limate change is emerging as the most consequential and most difficult energy-environment linkage of all. The production and use of energy contributes more than any other human activity to the change in radiative forcing that is currently occurring in the atmosphere; in fact, fossil-fuel combustion alone currently accounts for well over half of total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide (after accounting for different gases' carbon dioxide equivalent warming potential). Since the dawn of the industrial era, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased by about 40 percent; going forward, trends in energy production, conversion, and use—more than any other factor within human control—are likely to determine how quickly those levels continue to rise, and how far. The precise implications of the current trajectory remain unknown, but there is less and less doubt that the risks are large and more and more evidence that human-induced global warming is already underway... For most of human history, animals and biomass supplied the vast bulk of human energy needs. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution roughly two centuries ago, humans began to turn increasingly to hydrocarbons as their primary source of energy, marking a profound shift that brought with it an era of unprecedented technological, socio-economic, and cultural change."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“It is also argued by those advocating same-sex marriage, that excluding same-sex couples from marriage is the same act of discrimination as prohibiting interracial marriage, which has rightly been recognized as a serious breach of human rights. That argument is not correct. Because an interracial marriage between a man and a woman does symbolize the procreative relationship, its prohibition is based on racial discrimination which is wrong. In contrast, not extending the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, is not based on the sexual orientation of the partners, but the absence of a feature of their relationship which is an essential feature of marriage. In conclusion, society needs marriage to establish cultural meaning, symbolism and moral values around the inherently procreative relationship between a man and a woman, and thereby protect that relationship and the children who result from it. That is more necessary than in the past, when alternatives to sexual reproduction were not available. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would affect its cultural meaning and function and, in doing so, damage its ability and, thereby, society’s capacity, to protect the inherently procreative relationship and the children who result from it, whether those children’s’ future sexual orientation proves to be homosexual or heterosexual.”

[T]he words 'under God' are now as interwoven through the fabric of the pledge of allegiance as the threads of red, white, and blue into the fabric of the flag to which the pledge is recited. As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787. Regardless, this court finds that the recitation of the pledge of allegiance is a secular, not a religious activity and, thus, a constitutionally-protected activity."""
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""I have personally been in favor of the death penalty. I was a senior official in the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign and in the administration, and in that role I defended the President's stance in support of capital punishment. I have no illusions that the death penalty deters anyone from murder. I also have great concern about the ability of our justice system to avoid putting someone innocent to death. However, I believe there are some human beings who do such evil as to deserve to die. I am not troubled that Timothy McVeigh was executed for the 168 people he had killed in the Oklahoma City bombing, or that John Wayne Gacy was for committing 33 murders."""

01	"Is the Practice of Electronic Voting Machine ""Sleepovers"" Appropriate?"	"""The California Association of Clerks and Election Officials (CACEO) recognizes that distributing secured voting equipment to poll workers prior to Election Day is an efficient, accountable and transparent practice that contributes to the orderly and secure conduct of elections.  The following safeguards associated with this practice ensure that the integrity of the elections process is maintained: All poll workers take an oath to uphold the integrity of the elections process prior to initiating their duties. Poll workers are essential to ensuring public accountability in the elections process. It is appropriate that they are entrusted with the security of voting equipment and supplies prior to and during the day of the election; Poll workers are trained to confirm that voting equipment is sealed and that the tamper-evident seals are not broken prior to the opening of the polls on Election Day...  Sending voting equipment and supplies home with poll workers is equally secure to the alternative approach of delivering equipment to poll sites in advance of the election where the chain of custody and security cannot be as easily documented or traced... As a public and transparent process, elections in the United States historically rely on the checks and balances associated with appointing poll workers to oversee the conduct at the polls. This practice is consistent with that model."""

Each approach addresses different elements of a research question. Together, they offer a full complement of ways to learn about living systems. Animal studies are particularly crucial for understanding how the body functions in health and disease. Basic and translational research involving animals is a necessary component in the search for causes, preventions, treatments, and cures for disease.”
10	Are There Sufficient Procedures in Place to Guard against Physical Tampering with Electronic Voting Machines?

Surprisingly, each lock is identical and can be opened by any one of the 32,000 keys. Furthermore, team members [of RABA's security assessment team] were able to have duplicates made at local hardware stores. It is a reasonable scenario to assume that a working key is available to an attacker.  To make matters worse, using a commonly available lock pick set, one team member picked the lock in approximately 10 seconds. Individuals with no experience were able to pick the lock in approximately 1 minute...  Other mischief-makers demonstrated the ability to physically tilt the monitor of the AccuVote-TS forward to expose the connecting wires. They were then able to disconnect these wires without causing any damage. To reconnect the wires into their harness requires opening up the terminal - a procedure that is not allowed during an election."""

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“I would argue that subjecting churches to property taxes is a bad idea. The excesses of some Christian merchants aside, Churches are not profit-making entities. Many smaller churches struggle to make monthly expenses like salary and mortgage. Subjecting churches to property taxes would be a major burden on many smaller churches already struggling to get by and would therefore be a restriction on religious freedom… Some have complained that it is ‘unconstitutional’ to exempt churches (or mosques, synagogues, temples, and so forth) from taxation. It isn’t. So long as government does not show favoritism by picking and choosing which religions (or denominations) to exempt and which to tax, there is no ‘respecting an establishment of religion’ and therefore no Constitutional problem… Finally, despite the claims of some, exempting churches from taxation is not the same as a subsidy. If I do not take $10 from your wallet, I am not ‘giving’ you $10 – I am letting you keep what is yours. (Or in the case of churches, what was donated.) If I hand you a $10 bill and you place it in your wallet, that is a subsidy. Church members are already taxes [sic], both on income and property so there is no need to tax the money twice.”
10	Does the Regular Smoking of Marijuana Cause Lung Cancer or in Any Way Permanently Injure the Lungs?	is claimed that cannabis smoke is more harmful to the lungs than tobacco smoke because it contains much the same mixture of noxious substances, and because cannabis users inhale more deeply and deposit more tar in their lungs. On the other hand, cannabis users do not smoke 20 to 40 times a day, as many cigarette smokers do. There may be a health risk, and it is compounded by the combination of cannabis with tobacco, but there is currently no indisputable evidence for a link with cancer. The reports of cancers of the throat, mouth and larynx in cannabis users were based on small numbers and did not rule out effects of the concomitant use of tobacco. A much larger study in the United States monitored the health of a group of 65,000 men and women over a ten-year period. The 27,000 who admitted to having used cannabis showed no association between cannabis use and cancers, nor were there any other serious adverse effects on health.”
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The two-state solution is dead. There is no longer any hope for peace or justice in this solution, if there ever was to begin with. There was a time when Israel could have accepted a Palestinian state along the pre-June 1967 armistice line, with minor and mutually agreed upon revisions of the final border, and thereby 'secure' its 'gains' from the 1948 Arab-Israeli war...  The siege must end. The occupation must end. The violence must end. The rejection of elementary legal and moral principles must end. Only a just solution can bring a permanent peace, and there is today only but one just solution.   The Arabs proposed it before Israel existed, only to have it rejected by the Zionists and their Western benefactors–a single, united, democratic state with a constitution and representative government that recognizes the equal rights of all and protects the rights of the minority.   That was the only truly just solution in 1948, and it remains the only truly just solution today."""

I don’t know about you but I remember those field trips. I learned a lot on things that took me out of the classroom with my teacher’s guidance and gave me a view of a wider world. How much learning is exactly going on? Our children are getting good at filling in those little bubbles, but how much creativity is being left behind? How much passion for learning is being left behind? And what about those children who we know are bright and successful in the classroom but simply don’t perform well on tests?

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Stripping Teachers of their workplace professional rights will harm, not improve students learning. Anti-public education ‘reformers’ are forever repeating that rules and regulations make it impossible to fire ‘bad teachers.’ Here are the facts. During the first two years of a teacher’s career, a lengthy probation period, administrators can fire them for any reason, or for no reason at all. After that, the requirements are for the administrator to document the problem necessitating the teacher’s dismissal, and convince two out of three people on a panel of experts to agree. That’s it. A teacher’s simple right to a hearing before dismissal is not unfair to students. To the contrary: students need a stable, experienced teaching workforce, not a revolving door of educators… The [tenure] laws targeted in this case provide due process when a teacher is accused of misconduct or poor performance, and objectivity in times of layoff. These laws benefit the education system as a whole… The need for academic freedom, and therefore for ‘tenure,’ was demonstrated repeatedly, for instance, during the McCarthy era. Note also the case of Sal Castro, an historic figure who advocated for ethnically relevant courses for Latino students in Los Angeles in the 1960s. The district dismissed him essentially for being an advocate for students and he was only able to get his job back when the community organized for mass actions and took over the school board to get him reinstated.”

Southern states carry out more than 80 percent of the executions but have a higher murder rate than any other region. Texas has by far the most executions, but its homicide rate is twice that of Wisconsin, the first state to abolish the death penalty. Look at similar adjacent states: There are more capital crimes in South Dakota, Connecticut and Virginia (with death sentences) than neighboring North Dakota, Massachusetts and West Virginia (without death penalties). Furthermore, there has never been any evidence that the death penalty reduces capital crimes or that crimes increased when executions stopped."""

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“There is little doubt the air’s CO2 concentration has risen significantly since the inception of the Industrial Revolution; and there are few who do not attribute the CO2 increase to the increase in humanity’s use of fossil fuels. There is also little doubt the earth has warmed slightly over the same period; but there is no compelling reason to believe that the rise in temperature was caused by the rise in CO2… Proponents of the notion that increases in the air’s CO2 content lead to global warming point to the past century’s weak correlation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and global air temperature as proof of their contention. However, they typically gloss over the fact that correlation does not imply causation, and that a hundred years is not enough time to establish the validity of such a relationship when it comes to earth’s temperature history… In thus considering the seven greatest temperature transitions of the past half-million years – three glacial terminations and four glacial inceptions – we note that increases and decreases in atmospheric CO2 concentration not only did not precede the changes in air temperature, they followed them, and by hundreds to thousands of years… Hence, the climate history of the past half-million years provides absolutely no evidence to suggest that the ongoing rise in the air’s CO2 concentration will lead to significant global warming… Proponents of the CO2-induced global warming hypothesis often predict that extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes will become more numerous and/or extreme in a warmer world; however, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, many studies have revealed that the numbers and intensities of extreme weather events have remained relatively constant over the last century.”

01	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Severe / Chronic Pain?	a physician, I have constantly searched for treatment options for my patients’ chronic pain… I learned that marijuana not only has multiple potential medical uses, but it also has fewer side effects compared to other medications… In addition to pain relief, medical marijuana provides relief to the common conditions associated with chronic pain, such as anxiety/depression and insomnia. With medical marijuana, the pharmacological management for chronic pain can be simplified with lesser need to also prescribe medications for anxiety, depression and insomnia.”
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""Society is justly ordered when each person receives what is due to him. Crime disturbs this just order, for the criminal takes from people their lives, peace, liberties, and worldly goods in order to give himself undeserved benefits. Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order, making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done. This is retribution, not to be confused with revenge, which is guided by a different motive. In retribution the spur is the virtue of indignation, which answers injury with injury for public good...  Retribution is the primary purpose of just punishment as such. The reasons for saying so are threefold. First, just punishment is not something which might or might not requite evil; requital is simply what it is. Second, without just punishment evil cannot be requited. Third, just punishment requires no warrant beyond requiting evil, for the restoration of justice is good in itself... For these reasons, rehabilitation, protection, and deterrence have a lesser status in punishment than retribution: they are secondary."""
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Women are moral agents. Women are capable of making soulful, moral decisions about their own bodies. Assuming that a woman cannot decide for herself if and when to bear a child demeans women. Mandatory childbearing makes the woman a hostage to the will of others — those unfamiliar with her story, her life experience and her needs, and may have disastrous consequences for the children. Medical choices, like terminating a pregnancy, are medically available. Other life sustaining medical procedures are not considered immoral. Why the complaint against abortion? Our faith tradition teaches soul competency, a Baptist principle that is violated in restricting the right to choose an abortion. Our forebears suffered greatly, even to the point of death, to express their conviction that no one stands between the individual and God… As Christians, as Baptists, we wearily say, the right to choose a medical procedure is also a woman’s right. It has to do fundamentally with the freedom of our souls to practice our religion and morality in our own ways.”

So to date, the totality of the scholarly research on homosexuality indicates gayness is much more socio-cultural than biological… [S]exual orientations are specific to our culture, and thus not basic human nature. In tech-speak, that means being gay is in the software of some people’s lives, but it’s in nobody’s hardware.”
10	Is Transmitting Votes from Individual Polling Stations to the Central Tabulation Center a Secure Process?	"""Manual handling of the [vote total] numbers and the use of computer-readable media for recording the vote totals both raise issues of physical custody of the ledger or media in transport to the tabulation authority. For example, if precautions are not taken, an adversary could substitute a CD-ROM prewritten with the appropriate vote totals for the CD-ROM taken from a specific voting station.  Direct transmission of vote totals over a wired or wireless network renders the transmission vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in which the receiving computer is tricked into accepting numbers from an unauthorized source; or the transmission could be intercepted, modified, and played back."""

The future won’t be similar to the past for many college graduates and telling young people that college will be a good investment is careless and irresponsible. In truth, going to college isn’t an investment at all… No one receives any payment or premium merely for having finished college. Employers do not reward workers just for having passed enough classes to earn a degree. They reward workers for their productivity. Going to college might increase a person’s productivity, but it’s neither necessary nor sufficient for that. …These days, with the labor market saturated with college graduates, the time and money spent on college is often wasted.”

10	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""A Century ago, it didn't matter very much that a simple practice began that has now grown into a massive issue of birthright citizenship or the anchor baby agenda. When automatic citizenship started being granted to all babies born in the United States, our lawmakers missed the clause in the 14th Amendment that says, 'And subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' So once the practice began, it grew out of proportion and today between 340,000 and 750,000 babies are born in America each year that get automatic citizenship even though both parents are illegal. I know of no other country in the world that does this, and it must end. My Birthright Citizenship Act of 2017 fixes it, clarifies the 14th Amendment and clarifies the Constitutional meaning of the clause, 'And subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'

The U.S. climate protection program should create a domestic market that will establish a uniform price for GHG emissions for all sectors and should promote the creation of a global market...  Congress should specify an emission target zone aimed at reducing emissions by 60% to 80% from current levels by 2050...  Legislation should permit entities subject to the cap to meet part of their obligations through the purchase of verified emission offsets from a range of domestic sinks, domestic sources of emissions that are not subject to the cap, and projects outside the US.

01	Is Nuclear Power Cost-Effective?	"""[T]he cost of producing nuclear-generated electricity in 2007 was 1.7 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with 2.4 cents for coal, 6.7 cents for natural gas and 10.2 cents for oil. In other words, the cost of nuclear-generated electricity was nearly one-third less than power produced at a natural gas plant. And given the sharp rise in oil and gas prices so far this year, nuclear power's advantage has widened.  Instead of wasting high-priced natural gas for electricity production, it would make a lot more sense to replace the gas with additional nuclear power and clean-coal plants, while using solar, wind and other renewables to meet peak demand. Electricity customers would benefit if natural gas were to be reserved mainly for residential and industrial uses.  A straightforward and serious effort by Congress to move nuclear power forward as quickly as possible would win public support. Nuclear power is too important to be allowed to stall. The fate of our nation's economic health depends on it."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Amnesty International considers that to protect the rights of sex workers, it is necessary not only to repeal laws which criminalize the sale of sex, but also to repeal those which make the buying of sex from consenting adults or the organization of sex work (such as prohibitions on renting premises for sex work) a criminal offence...  The fact that various aspects of sex work are treated as criminal conduct in many countries means that sex workers cannot rely on support or protection from the police. For many sex workers, reporting crimes experienced during the course of their work means putting themselves at risk of criminalization and/or penalization on the basis of their involvement in sex work, seizure of their earnings, potential loss of their livelihood through related sanctions and/or monitoring by the police to detect their clients. As a result, sex workers are frequently unable to seek redress for crimes committed against them, thereby offering impunity to perpetrators. In addition, the stigmatized and criminalized status that sex workers experience gives law enforcement officials in many countries the scope to harass, extort and perpetrate physical and sexual violence against them, also with impunity. When they are not threatened with criminalization/penalization, sex workers are better able to collaborate with law enforcement to identify perpetrators of violence and abuse, including human trafficking."""

Hydroelectric power, a renewable source of energy created by the damming of rapidly-flowing rivers, was introduced in the 1890s, as was nuclear power in the late 1950s. In recent years, other renewable sources of energy – wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal – have entered the fray. However, while the use of renewable fuels is expected to increase in the years to come, their overall contribution to America's energy pool is forecast by the EIA [US Energy Information Agency] to remain very modest, far behind fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Nuclear power, by contrast, which currently supplies about 20 percent of US electricity, is expected to become a more prominent player as a new generation of power plants go into service in the decades to come."""

Dairy farmers don't tell consumers that every glass of milk is contaminated with pus, bacteria, and perhaps with paratuberculosis [a bacterium that causes Johne's disease (a chronic intestinal disease) in cows]. The only way to avoid drinking pus is to avoid cow's milk.

01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	Cell phone radiation levels are tested and certified to remain within levels deemed safe by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC sets the maximum amount of thermal radiation (heat) that cell phones are permitted to emit. [3] This limit is measured as the amount of radiation absorbed by a user and is known as the specific absorption rate (SAR). In 1996 the SAR for cell phone radiation was set at a maximum of 1.6 watts of energy absorbed per kilogram of body weight. Manufactures of cell phones must test their products to ensure that they meet this standard. Random tests of phones on the market by FCC scientists further ensure that radiation levels meet FCC guidelines. [48] Read More
10	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) Encourage the Healthcare Industry to Promote PAS, Endangering Vulnerable Groups?	"""Much of the opposition to physician-assisted dying comes from disability rights activists who falsely assume that legalizing the right to die poses a danger to them and undermines the value of their lives. Some people with disabilities fear that physician-assisted dying is a slippery slope and that if we legalize it in any form, soon we’ll be killing all disabled babies at birth, people will be bumping off their aging grandparents to get out of caring for them, and everyone in a wheelchair will feel obligated to kill themselves so as not to be a burden. Some people with disabilities hear in the right-to-die movement the old message that we disabled folks would be better off dead and that our lives are not worth living.  I understand from my own life experience where these fears come from. I am an older person, and I was born with a disability (my father was offered the chance to smother me at birth as a result). I have also had many friends over the years with severe disabilities, as well as friends who have lived well with serious chronic pain and incapacitation.

01	Should Bottled Water Be Banned? - Top 4 Pros and Cons	Banning bottled water would save money, and public water fountains are convenient and plentiful. Bottled water is expensive. It can cost between 400 to 2,000 times more than tap water, four times more than a gallon of milk, and three times more than a gallon of gasoline. [1][15] Mathematicians at Penn State University estimate that spending $20 on a reusable water bottle can save the average American up to $1,236 a year; for a family of four that amounts to nearly $5,000. [16] Eliminating plastic water bottle waste would also save local governments money. According to Food & Water Watch, US cities can spend over $100 million a year to dispose of such waste. [1] California, Oregon, and Washington spend an estimated $500 million a year removing waste from the Pacific coastline, including waste from plastic water bottles. [36] In San Francisco, where single-use plastic water bottles are banned, 31 water fountains are currently in use in public areas with 20 more in the pipeline.

I am not just referring to the satisfaction of winning -- rather, I am recognizing that in professional sports one's future may depend on winning.

10	Should US Customs and Border Enforcement Use Military Equipment to Help Prevent Illegal Immigration?	"""Begun in 1993 and extended to the entire southwest border by 1997, the policy of massive concentration of enforcement resources along the border has transformed the southwest borderlands into a perilous militarized zone and had cataclysmic consequences for migrants and border communities. This militarized enforcement strategy, dubbed 'prevention-through-deterrence' by Border Patrol, was conceived to intentionally force undocumented migrants away from urban areas to attempt crossings in more remote and dangerous terrain. Intended to increase the cost and risk associated with crossing the border without authorization, the policy has done just that, resulting in the deaths of many thousands since its implementation…   Today, over 18,500 Border Patrol agents roam the southwest border, employing a vast array of advanced technology including all manner of electronic surveillance equipment, unattended ground sensors, Predator drone aircraft, and Blackhawk helicopters. The borderlands now resemble a war zone more closely than at any point in history. Although fewer people appear to be crossing the border in recent years, a higher percentage of people perish along the way, suggesting that the border is now more dangerous than ever."""

At their core, standardized exams are designed to be objective measures. They assess students based on a similar set of questions, are given under nearly identical testing conditions, and are graded by a machine or blind reviewer. They are intended to provide an accurate, unfiltered measure of what a student knows… Outside of standardized test results, no objective method exists for policymakers to identify either poor-performing schools needing intervention or high-performing schools deserving rewards. Consider the alternative: Who would want policymakers to intervene in a school based on their ‘gut feeling’ or reward a school based on anecdotes? Statewide standardized exams are essential for upholding a fair and objective accountability system.”
