10	Is Solar Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""President Obama subsidized solar and other renewable energy in the United States with taxpayer money to the tune of $39 billion per year on average for the past 5 years. These massive subsidies, however, have done little to increase the contribution of solar power to the electricity generation mix as solar is expected to produce just 0.6 percent of electricity generation this year...   States also have also heavily subsidized the solar industry by offering tax breaks and 538 rebate programs. Twenty states have personal tax credits related to solar products, 18 states have corporate tax credit and deduction programs, and 14 states and Puerto Rico offer taxpayer-funded grants to support solar electricity. The 538 different state and local green energy rebate programs are intended to reduce the final cost of products including solar water heaters and grid-connected rooftop solar panels...   Government programs intended to drive down the cost of solar electricity have failed to make expensive sources of energy affordable. As result, instead of the consumer paying the full cost of solar-generated electricity, the government programs shift some of the cost to the taxpayer. Federal loans leave the taxpayer on the hook in cases where the loan is not repaid."""
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""The prohibition against killing patients... stands as the first promise of self-restraint sworn to in the Hippocratic Oath, as medicine's primary taboo: 'I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect'... In forswearing the giving of poison when asked for it, the Hippocratic physician rejects the view that the patient's choice for death can make killing him right. For the physician, at least, human life in living bodies commands respect and reverence--by its very nature."""
01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Let me offer five good reasons to go vegetarian that are worth considering by every kind and just person: First, we share with all animals the ability to feel joy, love, pain, loneliness, and the desire to avoid harm, so let’s relate to who is on our plate. Second, if we find it horrifying to imagine stepping into a factory farm, separating a mother cow from her calf and slitting the infant’s throat just so that we can experience the fleeting taste of a piece of meat, then we surely find something wrong with paying someone else – via our meat counter purchases – to do it for us. Third, it is impossible to talk about justice, understanding, and multiculturalism and to object to violence, exploitation, oppression, discrimination, and supremacism without choking if we are still trying to find a way to justify stealing the very lives from other individuals we consider ‘different.’ Fourth, meat is decomposing flesh from a body that was not given up without a struggle, fear, and suffering – unless we are eating roadkill from animals who died instantaneously and never knew what hit them. Five, it is so easy to switch to vegan living, because today we have cookbooks like Alicia Silverstone’s The Kind Diet; vegan fast food like Taco Bell’s 7-Layer Burrito (hold the dairy); an endless variety of ethnic restaurants (e.g., Italian, Ethiopian, Japanese, Szechuan, Indian); and supermarkets that sell protein-packed and cholesterol-free taste-alikes (e.g., soy sausage, fakin’ ‘bacon,’ vegan ‘cheese’ pizzas, and faux chicken) just in case we ever get a craving for the taste of meat or dairy products – and all of them come without the factory farming, environmental destruction, cruelty, and other ugly, dirty aspects of using animals as food.”
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“It’s time to rethink the drinking age… Twenty-one is not working. A culture of dangerous, clandestine ‘binge-drinking’—often conducted off-campus—has developed. Alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students. Adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting, signing contracts, serving on juries and enlisting in the military, but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer. By choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law. We call upon our elected officials: To support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year-old drinking age [and] to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.”
01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	"Students can express their individuality in school uniforms by introducing variations and adding accessories. Junior high school student Amelia Jimenez wrote in her op-ed for the Pennsylvania Patriot-News website that ""contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewlery."" The Seventeen and TeenVogue websites list numerous suggestions for students on how to add their personal style to school uniforms, including hairstyle options, the use of nail polish, and the addition of colorful accessories such as satchels, scarfs, and socks. [61][62]TeenVogue stated that ""there are tons of ways to amp up your standard issue getup.""

10	"Does the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs Violate the ""Spirit of Sport""?"	"""Some argue that taking drugs is 'against the spirit of sport.' But it is difficult to defend the current line between what athletes can and cannot do in order to enhance their performance.  In the Tour de France, cyclists can use overnight intravenous nutrition and hydration to restore their bodies. Training at high altitude is permitted, though it gives those athletes an edge over competitors who must train at sea level.  The World Anti-Doping Code no longer prohibits caffeine. In any case, performance-enhancement is...the very spirit of sport. We should allow athletes to pursue it by any safe means.  Moreover, I would argue that sport has no single 'spirit.' People play sports to socialize, for exercise, to keep fit, to earn money, to become famous, to prevent boredom, to find love, and for the sheer fun of it. They may strive to improve their performance, but often they do so for its own sake, for the sense of achievement."""

01	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“The lowering of the corporate tax rate will provide much needed debt-free capitalization, new jobs (particularly in the high tech industry), and new tax revenue… A lower corporate tax rate increases American competitiveness while providing an increased flow of domestic, debt-free capital that will boost investments and production. In reality, a corporate income tax often serves as a second retail tax for consumers. The lowering of such a tax can reduce prices within a competitive environment, thus controlling inflation and increasing consumer purchasing power. A further benefit of lowering the tax is to allow for higher wages and benefits – two areas that often bear the burden for paying corporate income taxes.”

01	Does Obamacare Require Payment Cuts to Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare Part C)? - YES	"""[T]he Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced payment formulas that will cut payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans in 2015. These include already-scheduled cuts legislated in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), as well as regulatory decisions that also affect these rates...  Overall, the cuts average about $317, or 3.07 percent, per Medicare Advantage enrollee compared to the rates in effect for 2014. However, after a series of annual cuts, MA enrollees in the next year will face a benefits reduction of about $1,538, or 13.32 percent, below the level projected for 2015 in the pre-ACA baseline...  The ACA cuts to Medicare total $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. A large percentage of the cuts come about through changes to the payment formulas for the MA [Medicare Advantage] program, in which beneficiaries use their Medicare dollars to choose a privately-run health plan that best meets their needs."""

10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“The practice of experimenting on nonhuman animals as it exists today throughout the world reveals the consequences of speciesism. Many experiments inflict severe pain without the remotest prospect of significant benefits for human beings or any other animals. Such experiments are not isolated incidences, but part of a major industry… We tolerate cruelties inflicted on members of other species that would outrage us if performed on members of our own species. Speciesism allows researchers to regard the animals they experiment on as items of equipment, laboratory tools rather than living, suffering creatures. In fact, on grant applications to government funding agencies, animals are listed as ‘supplies’ alongside test tubes and recording instruments… The exploitation of laboratory animals is part of the larger problem of speciesism and it is unlikely to be eliminated altogether until speciesism itself is eliminated. Surely one day, though, our children’s children, reading about what was done in laboratories in the 20th Century, will feel the same sense of horror and incredulity at what otherwise civilized people could do that we now feel when we read about the atrocities of the Roman gladiatorial arenas or the eighteenth-century slave trade.”
10	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""The biggest entitlement legislation in a generation is causing barely a ripple in corporate America.   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- otherwise known as Obamacare -- is putting such a small dent in the profits of U.S. companies that many refer to its impact as 'not material' or 'not significant,' according to a Bloomberg review of conference-call transcripts and interviews with major U.S. employers.  That's even after a provision went into effect this year requiring companies with 50 or more full-time workers to provide coverage, and after more workers are choosing to enroll in existing company coverage because of another requirement that all Americans get insured...  The collective shrug from the nation's biggest employers undermines the arguments of Republicans, who call the law a job-killer as they seek its repeal.  While U.S. health-care costs continued to rise faster than inflation in the five years since the law was passed, their rate of growth has slowed. Employers spent an average of $11,204 per worker for health benefits in 2014, up 4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to Mercer LLC. That growth rate was 6.1 percent or more each year from 1998 to 2011."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“The state [Texas] mandates childhood vaccines for enrollment in our schools because all children should have the opportunity to be educated in a safe and healthy environment. A twisted concept of parental personal liberty should not risk the health and safety of millions of schoolchildren… Cancers that are preventable should be prevented. Viruses that are preventable should be eradicated. And the safety and efficacy of vaccines are no longer subject to serious debate. They work, and Texas must make sure more of our citizens are immunized against preventable diseases.”
10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Students hold strong and passionate opinions about e-textbooks… While a majority dislikes e-textbooks, about 20 percent believe that they are the future – and should be. Perhaps I should have predicted such a reaction given that early in the school year many of these students had written a fiery editorial about e-textbooks in their social studies classes. In part it read, ‘… online textbooks hinder study habits and force the use of computers. … and are detrimental to learning and inconvenient.’ The editorial concluded with these words: ‘If the school wishes to cultivate the use of e-books, it should at the very least offer students the option to continue using the old, hardcover books.’ At one point, we did a straw poll with the option of a free Kindle with all their books loaded on it or their old textbooks. The result: 100 percent voted for their heavy, old textbooks… Students were adamant that it was ‘much easier to learn’ from a textbook. (Several students did say that they don’t like carrying heavy books.) With hardcover books, they told me, they can highlight sections and flip through and scan pages more easily; reviewing the highlighted pages helps them remember facts. Portability also was an important factor: With a textbook they could study in random places like at after-school games or practices or they could take it with them to a friend’s house, and no one would ever want to steal it, unlike a Kindle. They said that digital devices in general were hard on the eyes, hard to read outdoors, required dealing with a battery, and are fragile… [S]tudents really find it easier to learn from a textbook.”
01	Should the US Increase Its Use of Natural Gas?	"""I believe natural gas can and should be the driving force for how this Congress can take bold action to free our country from the death grip of high prices for imported oil, thereby improving our economy, enhancing national security and helping the environment...  [W]e don't need a new fuel, we don't need new engine technology, we don't need hundreds of billions of dollars. All you have to do is modify or replace today's internal combustion engines that run on gasoline and diesel and replace them with an internal combustion engine that runs on natural gas. And that's natural gas that costs less than half the price of gasoline, is more than two-thirds cleaner, and best of all, is produced right here at home in America, and we are proving to skeptics everyday that there is plenty of it...  I believe U.S. natural gas producers can increase supplies by 5% per year for at least the next decade and that assumes there is no more access to public lands and waters than there is today. So that means there's plenty of natural gas to burn to make electricity, plenty of natural gas to heat our homes and to make chemicals and plastics and there's plenty of natural gas available to begin the conversion of our transportation fleet from dirty, expensive, imported oil to clean-burning, affordable, abundant, American natural gas."""
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“If you think of college as opening doors after graduation, the debt closes those doors. Because you can only go after jobs that can service the debt which takes out about half the jobs that you could be getting… Because you won’t earn enough to pay back the loans each month. You won’t earn enough, for example, to live in a city where there are other young people and have your own apartment or your own place to live and pay back the debt. So then you have to start looking only at jobs that pay, say $20 an hour as opposed to jobs that pay $10 an hour. …But, in general we are not learning in college anything that’s useful in the workforce, and colleges right now are acutely aware of that and are trying to figure out how to re-position themselves, either as learning for the sake of learning, or becoming more vocational depending on the school. And companies are shifting how they hire people to focus more on what people do as opposed to where they’ve been educated.”
10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Not a single bite of food reaches our mouths that has not involved the killing of animals. By some estimates, at least 300 animals per acre—including mice, rats, moles, groundhogs and birds—are killed for the production of vegetable and grain foods, often in gruesome ways. Only one animal per acre is killed for the production of grass-fed beef and no animal is killed for the production of grass-fed milk until the end of the life of the dairy cow. And what about the human beings, especially growing human beings, who are suffering from nutrient deficiencies and their concomitant health problems as a consequence of a vegetarian diet? Or does only animal suffering count?… Vegetarians wishing to make a political statement should strive for consistency. Cows are slaughtered not only to put steak on the table, but to obtain components used in soaps, shampoos, cosmetics, plastics, pharmaceuticals, waxes (as in candles and crayons), modern building materials and hydraulic brake fluid for airplanes. The membrane that vibrates in your telephone contains beef gelatin. So to avoid hypocrisy, vegetarians need to also refrain from using anything made of plastic, talking on the telephone, flying in airplanes, letting their kids use crayons, and living or working in modern buildings. The ancestors of modern vegetarians would not have survived without using animal products like fur to keep warm, leather to make footwear, belts, straps and shelter, and bones for tools. In fact, the entire interactive network of life on earth, from the jellyfish to the judge, is based on the sacrifice of animals and the use of animal foods. There’s no escape from dependence on slaughtered animals, not even for really good vegan folks who feel wonderful about themselves as they finish their vegan meal… Going vegetarian is very difficult. The body needs animal foods and provides a powerful drive to eat them. Cravings and resentment are a natural byproduct of a vegetarian diet, not to mention separation from the the majority of humankind by unnatural eating habits and sense of moral rectitude.”
10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	A gold backed currency could not expand fast enough to maintain a healthy rate of international trade and economic growth. At current mining rates, the total world gold supply increases about 1.5% to 2% per year [61], which is not enough to maintain a healthy rate of global economic growth.

10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Grand claims about environmental laws and regulations creating a flood of green jobs have been made for nearly a decade.

In 2008, when running for president, Barack Obama promised creation of 5 million green jobs nationally. In 2010, when running for governor, Jerry Brown promised creation of 500,000 new green jobs in the Golden State.  None of these assertions ever came remotely true. A 2011 New York Times analysis depicted Obama's and Brown's rhetoric as a 'pipe dream' and concluded that 'federal and state efforts to stimulate creation of green jobs have largely failed.' The granddaddy of liberal think tanks, the Brookings Institution, noted that green jobs grew more slowly from 2003 to 2010 than regular jobs in the U.S., and reported that the number of green jobs in Silicon Valley had actually gone down during that period. In the first quarter of 2014, only 5,600 green energy jobs were created in the entire nation, according to the Energy Collective website.  The McKinsey management consulting group's assessment of a decade ago – that green jobs are a niche of the economy, not a pillar – has been confirmed over and over again.

Furthermore, the evidence suggested a beneficial effect of milk and dairy intake on bone mineral density but no association with risk of bone fracture. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with [protective against] colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer, while the evidence for prostate cancer risk was inconsistent.

Quite simply, Israel has created the one state. This state gives 80% of its citizens (the Jewish population) full democratic and civil rights. 20% of the citizens (Palestinian citizens of Israel) experience institutionalized discrimination in virtually all sectors of civil and political life. The remaining population in the West Bank lives in an apartheid like system of separate and unequal rights under full military occupation by Israel. The population of Gaza is surrounded by walls and predator drones which constantly monitor their movements while preventing the growth of a sovereign state.  Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories form one state under complete Israeli control. Israeli negotiators with the cover of continued American aid and diplomatic assistance have taken every opportunity to stop an equitable two-state solution from coming into existence.

01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Age 18 traditionally separates minors from adults. But one can’t legally buy a drink in America until age 21. Meanwhile, many states are now sending minors into the adult criminal justice system, even for nonviolent crimes… Our society’s age-specific approaches often boil down to curbing the freedoms of the young — and increasing their punishments… The drinking age has long been a tug-of-war. Is a 19-year-old mature enough to fight in Afghanistan but not to order beer in a bar? Almost every other country sets the drinking age at 18. The presidents of 135 colleges have called for lowering the drinking age from 21 [see Amethyst Initiative above]. They note that the age restriction hasn’t stopped binge drinking on campus and argue, not without reason, that it has turned alcohol into forbidden fruit begging to be picked.

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“America’s real-world experiment with regulating marijuana has been a success… Contrary to the fears of some, these policy changes are not associated with increased marijuana use or access by adolescents, or with adverse effects on traffic safety or in the workplace. Marijuana regulations are also associated with less opioid abuse and mortality. In jurisdictions where this retail market is taxed, sales revenue has greatly exceeded initial expectations. The enforcement of marijuana prohibition financially burdens taxpayers, encroaches upon civil liberties, engenders disrespect for the law, and disproportionately impacts young people and communities of color. It makes no sense from a public health perspective, a fiscal perspective, or a moral perspective to perpetuate the prosecution and stigmatization of adults who choose to responsibly consume a substance that is safer than either alcohol or tobacco… But legalization does not mean replacing criminalization with a marijuana free-for-all. Rather, it means the enactment of a pragmatic regulatory framework that allows for the licensed commercial production and retail sale of marijuana to adults, but also restricts and discourages its use among young people. Such a regulated environment best reduces the risks associated with the plant’s use or abuse. By contrast, advocating marijuana’s continued criminalization does nothing to offset the plant’s potential risks to the individual user and to society; it only compounds them.”

Anecdotal evidence of positive outcomes from these technologies — such as political activities organized via Facebook or jobs found through LinkedIn — is well-known, but now a growing corpus of academic research on social networks sites supports this view as well… Social technologies never have predictable and absolute positive or negative effects, which is why social scientists dread questions like these. In considering the effects of social network sites, it is clear that there are many challenges to work through — the increasing commercialization of this space, the need to construct strong privacy protections for users, and safety issues — but I believe the benefits we receive as a society provided by these tools far outweigh the risks.”

01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity. Therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency -- unless that electricity is used to substitute for oil in our transportation system...   Converting our electric system fully to renewables would require us to shut down about 80 percent of our current electricity-generating capacity, much of it low-cost, already paid off and capable of generating electricity for another 25 years or more. Moreover, to reach very high penetration rates of renewable electricity would require that we overcome the principal shortcoming of wind and sunlight: intermittency.  Powering 100 percent of our transportation system would require about 30 percent of the electricity generated in 2006. With a massive effort, using a combination of solar and wind power, we could generate about that much electricity by 2020."""
10	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?

Withdrawing or withholding life sustaining treatment in this clinical situation is not morally equivalent to active euthanasia…   The physician is a healer. The ends of medicine are health, cure and care. When a cure is not attainable and health cannot be restored, the physician must care for his patient.

01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Contrary to just being a medical condition or risk factor for other diseases, obesity is a complex disease of multifaceted aetiology, with its own disabling capacities, pathophysiologies and comorbidities. It meets the medical definition of disease in that it is a physiological dysfunction of the human organism with environmental, genetic and endocrinological aetiologies. It is a response to environmental stimuli, genetic predisposition and abnormalities, and has a characteristic set of signs and symptoms with consistent anatomical alterations. Excess adipose tissue increases the work of the heart and leads to anatomical changes in this organ. It alters pulmonary, endocrine and immunological functions, all with adverse effects on health. Some of the complications of obesity include cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis and cancer. Given the excess mortality, substantial morbidity and the economic toll of obesity, this is a disease that warrants serious attention by the medical community.”

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Raising the hourly minimum wage to $15 in New York State – as Governor Andrew M. Cuomo is proposing – provides vitally important benefits to the state’s economy, ensuring opportunity for millions of New Yorkers and creating jobs. On the facts, raising the minimum wage increases the standard of living for workers, reduces poverty, incentivizes fair and more efficient business practices, and ensures that the most vulnerable members of the workforce can contribute to the economy. Increasing the minimum wage stimulates demand for goods and services, leading employers to bring on new staff to keep up with this increased demand. As a whole, all New Yorkers benefit from a $15 minimum wage… Raising the minimum wage to $15 would directly benefit 2.3 million workers in New York State, or about a quarter of the total workforce. Contrary to what many believe, raising the minimum wage affects more adults – including many who support families – than it does high-school students earning weekend pocket money. Half of all workers earning $15 per hour or less are 35 or older. Outside of New York City, 70 percent of these workers are over the age of 25. In New York City, 80 percent of these minimum wage workers are over age 25, and more than half (over 53 percent) are 35 or older.”

Now there is an additional capital gains tax included in the Affordable Care Act, and yes it will affect a narrow field of real estate transactions...  There is a new tax on investment income which will cover the income from interest, dividends, rents, as well as capital gains. It's not a transfer tax on real estate sales.  While the sale of a home can be subject to this tax, it is only if a number of criteria are met.

It is naïve to believe such attitudes would not be used to justify the death of people with severe disabilities if the opportunity arose...  The lower court also found that HB 35-E [legislation that granted Jeb Bush the power to re-insert Terri Schiavo's feeding tube] infringed on Ms. Schiavo's right to privacy, specifically her right to refuse medical treatment.

10	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""[T]he modern view [of the Fourteenth Amendment] ignores—or misunderstands—a key phrase in the Citizenship Clause, which sets out two criteria for automatic citizenship rather than just one. Mere birth on U.S. soil is not enough. A person must be both 'born or naturalized in the United States' and 'subject to its jurisdiction' in order to be granted automatic citizenship. Congress remains free to offer citizenship more broadly than that, of course, pursuant to its plenary power over naturalization granted in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, but it has done so. Current law merely parrots the 'birth' and 'subject to the jurisdiction' requirements that are the floor for automatic citizenship already set by the Constitution.  With the ever-increasing waves of illegal immigration into this country undermining the policy judgments Congress has made about the extent of immigration that should be allowed, it is particularly important to get the birthright citizenship issue right, as the mistaken notion about it has provided a powerful magnet for illegal immigration for far too long. Worse, it has encouraged a trade in human trafficking that has placed at great risk millions of men, women, and children who have succumbed to the false siren's song of birthright citizenship."""

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution, honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith. Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society. Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots without weakening the good influence of society. Government, by recognizing and protecting marriage, serves the interests of all. Today, I call upon the Congress to promptly pass and to send to the states for ratification an amendment to our Constitution defining and protecting marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife. The amendment should fully protect marriage, while leaving the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage. America’s a free society which limits the role of government in the lives of our citizens. This commitment of freedom, however, does not require the redefinition of one of our most basic social institutions.”

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“[I]n 1981, amidst a serious inflation problem, Reagan created a commission to study a gold standard. You couldn’t have picked a more sympathetic president, or a more sympathetic moment, to the gold standard. And they still rejected it. Now fast forward 30 years. There’s no inflation problem. The head of the Federal Reserve was originally appointed by George W. Bush and is credited by most observers as having headed off a potential Great Depression through creative monetary policy. And so what does the Republican Party want to do? Well, according to a draft of the party’s platform, they want another Gold Commission… The problems with the gold standard are legion, but the most obvious is that our currency fluctuates with the global price of gold as opposed to the needs of our economy… Today, inflation is about as low as it’s ever been, and if you look at market expectations… it’s expected to stay low. Moreover, we’ve just come through a financial crisis in which the entire global economy might well have collapsed if the Federal Reserve hadn’t stepped in as the lender of last resort after the credit markets froze. We’ve been watching as the euro zone dissolves amidst fears that the European Central Bank won’t act as a lender of last resort… Unlike 1981, in other words, when the gold standard made a kind of superficial sense as a response to our problems, 2012 is a moment when a gold standard would clearly have worsened our problems.

01	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""Calcium intake through milk and milk products... has a direct and distinct effect on the bone parameters of young adults. [Our research] shows that bone mineral content of both groups rises as calcium intake increases through milk and milk products, but the same amounts of calcium led to higher bone mineral values in young males than in young females.  For elderly subjects, we also studied whether calcium intake via milk and milk products during different periods of life affected the bone parameters in advanced age. The evidence was clear that calcium intake via milk and milk products, particularly in childhood and adolescence, is essentially responsible for the bone mineral content in the elderly.   Calcium intake via milk and dairy products of the male and female osteoporotic subjects had been markedly lower during childhood and adolescence (55 and 46%, respectively) than that of their age-matched controls. This finding confirms that inadequate calcium intake during these early periods of life is a decisive risk factor for the development of osteoporosis.  These findings lead to the conclusion that an adequate calcium intake-which can best be ensured through milk and milk products-is not only a prerequisite for optimal bone formation but also a means to prevent enhanced bone resorption. This association is of special relevance for osteoporotic patients. Adequate calcium intake via milk and milk products was an important protective factor against bone resorption for both male and female osteoporotics, as expressed by the 40 to 50% reduction of the serum osteocalcin."""
01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Marijuana legalization is not just a political or legislative issue; it is also about race. It is intertwined with almost every issue facing African Americans and should be front and center on black America’s agenda… Police are more likely to use force against African Americans because they are more likely to stop or detain them… Pot is often a contributing factor to police brutality because it gives officers the freedom to detain and arrest, and search people based on nothing but suspicion… Stop and frisk is a marijuana-arrest tool… An analysis of the New York City Police Department’s 2012 data revealed that cops used stop and frisk to recover 729 guns but stopped 26,000, and arrested 5,000 people for marijuana possession. Blacks and Latinos were more likely to be stopped than whites but less likely to be found with a weapon or drugs. By 12th grade, both white and black juveniles were found to have used marijuana at the same rate, but underage black children were arrested for it at higher rates than their white counterparts… If black children are arrested more often for marijuana, the long-term effects can be dire. A drug conviction could render a student ineligible for financial aid and could pop up during employee-background checks, eliminating opportunities for employment. The disparity in sentencing affects the families of the people convicted, increases the number of parents taken away from their children, and trickles down into poverty and unemployment rates. Legalizing pot is not just a hot-button political topic; it is the first step in dismantling the war on drugs that has wreaked havoc on the black community for 80 years.”

I believe Obamacare's rocky start — clueless planning, a lousy website, insurance companies raising rates, and the president's telling people they could keep their coverage when, in fact, not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go. When right-wing critics 'expose' the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004, they're actually telling the truth.  By 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies. You can be sure they'll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare.  For many people, the 'affordable' part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke. The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $65,000 a year in Hartford, Conn., will cost $11,800 in annual premiums. And their deductible will be $12,600.

10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. But too many lives are at stake to worry about being fashionable. I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store. And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana—so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful. Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life.”
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	A gold standard would reduce the risk of economic crises and recessions such as the housing bubble and financial crisis of 2008-2009. The ability of the Federal Reserve to print fiat money and maintain easy credit by keeping interest rates too low from 2001 to 2006 [23] was a significant cause of the real estate bubble which led to the Great Recession. [21] [22] The response to the recession has been more of what caused it in the first place – printing money. Over $2 trillion in bailouts for failed financial institutions was paid for with Federal Reserve money, [24] setting the stage for another possible bubble and collapse. [25] The Fed's history of providing economic stablility with fiat money has not been a good one. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard there have been 12 financial crises, including the financial crisis of 2008-2009. [20] Read More

01	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""Today, sport's dirty little secret is drugs, and it is high time we made them legal. Performance-enhancing drugs may not be desirable, but they are here to stay. What we can do away with is the hypocrisy.  Insiders know that many - perhaps most - top players in all sports take drugs to train harder and feel no pain during play. The trainers, sports doctors, nutritionists, physiotherapists and managers of the big names make sure banned substances are taken at the safest and most efficient levels, and when they can, the governing bodies look the other way...  What many of us don't realise is that sports doping rarely gives you a free ride. If you or I were to take anabolic steroids and sit down in front of the telly, we would not build muscle or speed or endurance. Drugs allow you to train harder. They help you recover more quickly from a hard session so you can work hard again the next day. Some drugs boost the body's propensity for building muscle or its ability to use oxygen, but you still have to do the work...  Tales of sport doping go back to ancient Egypt, where the hoof of an Abyssinian ass ground up and boiled in oil was prescribed to improve performance. In the 19th century, boxers took heroin before going into the ring. The legendary 1960s Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg has confessed that he took amphetamines before matches...  The main effect of banning such substances has been to turn performers and their coaches into liars and cheats. We should legalise performance-enhancing drugs so that they can be regulated and athletes on the way up - whose entourages do not yet include savvy physiotherapists and doctors - don't overdose and do themselves damage."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The concept that 'mom's job' is having sex with strangers sets the wrong tone for family life.

That does nothing to enhance the relationship between a man and a woman.   {Prostitution] runs opposite to what relationships are supposed to be. Intimacy and love are not involved; it's just a purely physical act. It lowers both people to the lowest common denominator."""
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Permafrost is melting at unprecedented rates due to global warming, causing further climate changes. According to a 2013 IPCC report there is ""high confidence"" (about an 8 out of 10 chance) that anthropogenic global warming is causing permafrost, a subsurface layer of frozen soil, to melt in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions. [49] As permafrost melts it releases methane, a greenhouse gas that absorbs 84 times more heat than CO2 for the first 20 years it is in the atmosphere, creating even more global warming in a positive feedback loop. [50][51] By the end of the 21st century, warming temperatures in the Arctic will cause a 30%-70% decline in permafrost. [52] According to a 2012 report, as human-caused global warming continues, Arctic air temperatures are expected to increase at twice the global rate, increasing the rate of permafrost melt, changing the local hydrology, and impacting critical habitat for native species and migratory birds. [53] According to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, some climate models suggest that near-surface permafrost will be ""lost entirely"" from large parts of Alaska by the end of the 21st century.

Nuclear power is none of those things...Dozens of facilities were never completed or have sat idled because of cost overruns or insufficient safety provisions.  Wall Street (Inhofe's term) will not finance these facilities because future plants are likely to cost more than $5 billion...a recent Congressional Budget Office report predicts that more than 50 percent of proposed plants would default on loan guarantees...  Congress should pass comprehensive energy reform that leads the U.S. to focus on efficiency, conservation and renewable energy sources — all of which truly will be clean, reliable and cost-effective."""

CMA [California Medical Association] has decided that the solution is completely to legalize marijuana for all purposes, both medical and recreational, and then study it. But this is backwards. With no other modern medication have we taken this approach. Can you imagine if we made some new psychoactive substance — say Spice, K-2, or ‘bath salts’– fully legal before researching it?… Furthermore, the raw marijuana plant material — itself containing hundreds of unknown components — has not met FDA’s standards of safety and efficacy… [W]e don’t smoke opium to reap the benefits of morphine, nor do we chew willow bark to receive the effects of aspirin. Similarly, we should not have to smoke marijuana to get potential therapeutic effects from its components. [M]edical marijuana as it stands today, in California and many other states, has turned into a sad joke. A recent study found that the average ‘patient’ was a 32-year-old white male with a history of drug and alcohol abuse and no history of a life-threatening disease… Real medications must be fully studied, then approved by the FDA, then made available to patients by prescription.”

10	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""A lot of people used to think this [paper trail] would solve the integrity problems with electronic voting machines (DREs).

And research has showed that most voters don't look at them. Also, research shows DREs with many more undervotes than optical scan... DREs with paper trails work so badly that I don't know anyone who favors them anymore. Some people say they'd rather have a DRE with a paper trail than a paperless DRE, but they also say they'd rather have optical scan than DRE with paper trail... So my answer is that DREs with or without paper trails should be banned."""

I'm sure some cops, lawyers and judges sometimes enter this market, but they can never admit it because it would undercut their authority to arrest, prosecute and punish those who gave them release the day before.  Whether one pays to participate in an orgy or to hire the services of a prostitute, I see no reason to bring in the heavy guns of the criminal law. When it comes to sex, I see only one legal rule of any real importance: for sex to be lawful there only needs to be consent, and it should not matter whether consent is secured by direct payment or weeks of expensive courtship with fine dining and false promises."""

An audit using a record of votes printed post-closing, of course, could not be considered a manual audit of the complete voting system - it would be a partial audit, at best, limited to the math performed by the computer. It would not be an audit of whether the voters' intent was accurately recorded by the computer - and that is the critical issue...  The distinction between an original paper record of an act and electronic records as indirect evidence is an important one in the field of audit, as indicated by the standards of the auditing practice promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants...In this light, the significance of the HAVA requirement that the system produce 'a permanent record' for use in a 'manual audit' or a recount is again apparent. HAVA does not provide for a manual audit of an electronic record of votes cast (or of a printout of an electronic record, which is the same thing).

The result is that Israel has succeeded in conquering the West Bank but ended its chances of remaining a Jewish state… The only viable alternative, and one gaining increasing traction, is the one-state solution… A one-state equation isn't about dismissing or ignoring Jewish history, but recognising the land is shared between two peoples and a soon-to-be minority Jewish population has no legal or ethical right to control a majority Arab people.  On its current path, despite some mainstream Israeli politicians advocating the illegal annexation of the West Bank to create an indefinite apartheid state, Israel will become increasingly ghettoised and militarised, convincing once-proud diaspora supporters to decide between their morality and Zionist loyalties.

10	Ride-Hailing Apps Such as Uber and Lyft - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Ride-hailing services increase traffic congestion, emissions, and total vehicle miles traveled. Ride-hailing adds a total of 5.7 billion miles of driving each year in the nine metropolitan areas (Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and DC) that account for 70% of such trips in the United States. [3] At least 40% of the time, drivers are traveling without passengers in the car, adding more miles and vehicle emissions that wouldn't exist without ride-hailing. [3][2] As many as 60% of riders would have used public transit, walked, biked, or not taken a trip at all if ride-hailing wasn't an option. [9] That means that nearly two-thirds of ride-hailing trips added additional cars to the roads. [10] Studies show that ride-hailing makes traffic worse during already congested rush hours, because of the extra cars they add to the road, and because these drivers look at their phones more for passenger pick ups and directions. [9][10] Researchers found that ride-hailing contributes to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. [2]

"""Now that the world's credit markets are suffering the equivalent of a cardiac arrest, one can confidently say that the peak in global oil production is behind us.

Thus even though the peak might have been delayed for another year or five if the credit crunch hadn’t intervened, that time cushion is now effectively gone.  This is not to say that Peak Oil should no longer to be considered to be of importance. In the larger, longer view of things, the energy decline will be the determining factor in the fate of our civilization—not a money or credit crisis.

"""What the Religious Right doesn't tell people, and what, tragically, many Americans apparently don't know, is that when it comes to determining what the laws of the United States mean, the only document that matters is the Constitution. The Constitution, a completely secular document, contains no references to God, Jesus or Christianity. It says absolutely nothing about the United States being officially Christian. The Religious Right's constant appeals to documents like the Declaration of Independence, which contains a deistic reference to 'the Creator,' cloud the issue and make some people believe their rights spring from these other documents. They don't. As important as those other documents are to history, the rights of all Americans are ultimately traced to the Constitution and its amendments, specifically the Bill of Rights. When we talk about separation of church and state and religious freedom, therefore, only one document matters the Constitution."""

What's your formal reaction -- MR. McCLELLAN: ...Let me make a couple of points. We all want our troops to return home soon. The best way to get our troops home and to honor them is to complete the mission in Iraq. That means continuing to train Iraqi forces so that they can take over all of the security of their own country and provide for their own defense. There are a lot of families here at home that want to see those troops come home. The President wants to see those troops come home. But it's important that we complete the mission because this is critical to winning the war on terrorism and defeating the terrorists."""

This is clearly a private matter in which the state should not seek to legislate...   Criminalisation does not help people get out of prostitution and legalisation does not trap them in it.   As a society we can choose whether to make it easier for people to escape prostitution or whether to make life harder for those trapped in it.   I have always believed that any person selling sex has a right to demand whatever resources it would take for them to leave prostitution into a situation that they can realistically thrive and grow in."""
10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“I think the ISRA [Illinois State Rifle Association] should explain to the public why carrying hidden and loaded handguns in public is a good idea when we have a mountain of evidence that too many CCW permit holders in other states are unstable and violent, resulting in an appalling number of homicides. This evidence points to one conclusion, that a concealed weapons law is dangerous and a major threat for Illinois residents.”

"""The foundation of disenfranchisement was laid long before the Reconstruction era and continues to support a structure of African-American disenfranchisement that is more expansive, and impacts not only the individual African-American male ex-felon but also the African-American community as a whole...   Legally, African-Americans have achieved the status of citizen. Practically, African-Americans have to continue to fight obstacles set up to deny their citizenship. Historically, in a number of United States' jurisdictions, African-Americans have had to challenge poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, whites-only primaries, and felon disenfranchisement laws, all designed to prohibit them from voting and thus negate their citizenship. All of the other forms of disenfranchisement have fallen by the wayside, save one — felon disenfranchisement laws."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“Marriage has its own dignity and purpose and its own mission: bringing together male and female so that children can know and be known by, love and be loved by, their own mother and father. Same-sex marriage is unjust because it is founded on an untruth. Same-sex unions are not marriages… Only a fairly small minority of same-sex couples actually enter marriages where they are available. What gay marriage will do and is doing is disconnect marriage as an idea from its natural roots, and increasingly stigmatize the people (and institutions) who adhere strongly to our traditional views of marriage… Same-sex marriage is profoundly unjust because it misuses the law to require something that is not true: these unions, however great they are in other ways, are not marriages and nobody should be required by law to treat them as marriages.”

The mere fact that the community demands the murderer's life in return for the evil he has done cannot sustain the death penalty... The death penalty, unnecessary to promote the goal of deterrence or to further any legitimate notion of retribution, is an excessive penalty forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“[T]he booming prosperity over which Clinton presided, combined with his progressive tax and distribution policies, meant that for the first time since the 1960s, the lowest quintile of earners saw their lot improve during his presidency… Bill Clinton oversaw the most successful foreign policy since John F. Kennedy… By the end of his second [term], he had achieved major diplomatic achievements – sometimes with the aid of military force – in Bosnia and Kosovo, Northern Ireland, and Israel and the Palestinian territories… Clinton did much more than survive. He made the Democratic Party viable again in presidential elections. He reoriented liberalism, retaining its core commitments to a mixed economy, a welfare state, civil rights, civil liberties, and an internationalist foreign policy – while also acknowledging where its past policies on welfare, crime, and other issues had lost the confidence of the American people. He recognized the coming of globalization and sought new policies to deal with its challenges. His programs contributed… to peace and shared prosperity, declines in violent crime and out-of-wedlock births, and a liberalizing national temper on culture war issues. Race relations improved steadily, according to both whites and blacks.”
01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Wearing a uniform is a badge of pride, creates an identity for a school and is an important part of being a school student… A school uniform teaches students to dress smartly and take pride in their appearance… Perhaps most importantly, a uniform means students don’t have to worry about peer pressure when it comes to their clothes. When everyone is dressed the same, worrying about what you look like isn’t so important. There is no competition about being dressed in the latest trend, which would put a great deal of financial pressure on students and parents. Potential bullies have one less target for their insults; it’s hard to make fun of what someone is wearing when you’re dressed exactly the same… My uniform might not be what I would wear in my own time, but it gives me a sense of belonging, takes away the pressure of what to wear and deters the bullies. School uniform isn’t fashionable, but that’s exactly why I think it should be here to stay.”

And it doesn’t mean that we don’t need stricter gun laws to keep them out of the hands of criminals and those with a complete disregard for human life. Perhaps the fierce gun proponents need to take a walk in our neighborhoods, where young children have to dodge bullets just to get an education, or where mothers and fathers spend sleepless nights figuring out ways to keep their families safe… [W]e cannot continue to bury our precious ones. Life is indeed short, but let’s not make it shorter by killing one another needlessly. Get guns out of the community and stop them from ever finding their way back in.

With top-down regulation, as Mr. Obama explained, regulators dictate 'every single rule that a company has to abide by, which creates a lot of bureaucracy and red tape and often-times is less efficient.'...

[12] Drivers have flexibility to set their own hours, a benefit that 80% cite as important to them; nearly one in four (23%) were unemployed prior to becoming a driver. [12] 63% of drivers work behind the wheel fewer than 20 hours per week, using the job to supplement their incomes and pay bills. [13] The Economic Development Research Group found that Uber contributed $17 billion in gross domestic product to the US economy, as well as $580 million in added business productivity and $11 million in additional spending by international visitors who use ride-hailing to travel to more locations than they otherwise would have. [13] Lyft reported that its drivers earned more than $3.6 billion in 2017, and that passengers contributed an additional $2 billion of spending in their communities.

And we certainly know that our intelligence community is not infallible, and they’ve made lots of mistakes. We also know for a fact that the drone program kills lots and lots and lots of people who are no threat to the United States… I would say, as a military officer with 29 years’ experience, and a U.S. diplomat, that we have a weapons system that is causing blowback to the interests of the United States. Using the assassin program is making the United States more insecure rather than secure. That it is harming our national security, not enhancing it. And that we should stop this drone program.

01	Does Drinking Milk Inhibit Iron Absorption and Contribute to Anemia?	"""Foods that are sources of dietary protein can both increase and reduce the absorption of nonheme iron [iron contained within a protein]. Animal tissue (beef, pork, liver, chicken and fish) increases the absorption of this micronutrient. On the other hand, casein and whey proteins from cow's milk account for the greater proportion of the protein present in the majority of infant formulae and foods and have a negative influence on iron uptake...  Cow's milk has approximately four times more calcium than human milk, which can contribute to low iron absorption. The practical nutritional implications of the inhibitory effect of calcium on iron uptake were demonstrated by Hallberg et al. when they observed that the consumption of milk or milkshake with hamburgers or the addition of cheese to a pizza reduced nonheme iron absorption by 63, 47 and 61%, respectively. This maximum inhibitory effect is achieved with an approximate intake of 150-200 mg of calcium, which is the equivalent to that contained in one glass of milk or a piece of cheese, for which reason the authors recommend that these should not be consumed regularly at the main iron-providing meals, particularly by those who have increased iron requirements (children, adolescents and women of fertile age)."""

There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way people view the conflict and ways to solve it. That involves acknowledging that Israel has created a one-state reality, and finding ways to make that state equitable rather than a vehicle for the apartheid system that exists today.

Further, two-states for the two nations is the most effective way of minimizing state-to-nation imbalances. Partition resolves the 'nation without state' and the stateless refugees problem for the Palestinian imbalance, while producing a clear-cut Jewish majority state in Israel instead of the unstable and imbalanced de-facto bi-national situation."""
10	Should Felons Who Have Completed Their Sentence (Incarceration, Probation, and Parole) Be Allowed to Vote?	"""The proposal to automatically restore felons' right to vote as soon as they have completed their sentences is shortsighted and bad public policy. When presented as a measure of compassion and justice, it is also hypocritical, as automatic restoration is not in the best interests of felons or the general public…  Several years ago, liberal groups unsuccessfully sued Florida, claiming that the state's rules were unconstitutional and a violation of the Voting Rights Act. In Johnson v. Bush, a federal appeals court dismissed those claims, noting that 'criminal disenfranchisement provisions have existed as a punitive device' throughout history.  People truly concerned with the well-being of felons and their successful reintegration into the civil society would want the type of system Florida has. Felons have, by definition, knowingly and intentionally violated the laws of society. A five- or seven-year waiting period gives felons the opportunity — and an incentive — to prove they are deserving of exercising their right to vote."""

01	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	is fundamentally wrong to make preserving one’s health — or life — a crime. Yet federal marijuana laws, along with the laws of many states, do just that. There is overwhelming evidence that cannabis is one of the safest treatment options. Even the DEA’s Chief Administrative Law Judge at the time, Francis Young, came to that conclusion. Research has shown that marijuana alleviates several serious symptoms and conditions including pain, nausea and wasting, Crohn’s disease, spasms, and glaucoma. While around 15,000 Americans die every year from overdoses on prescription opiates, there has never been a medically documented fatal overdose on marijuana. Meanwhile, research has shown that cannabis can allow patients to reduce or eliminate their need for opiates. It is cruel and senseless to criminalize the doctor-advised use of a safe and effective treatment option.”

Californians pay more than $117 million each year to maintain a death penalty system that is functionally equivalent to death in prison.

01	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""While the fossil-fuel era is entering its sunset years, a new energy regime is being born that has the potential to remake civilization along radical new lines. Hydrogen is the most basic and ubiquitous element in the universe. It is the stuff of stars and, when properly harnessed and made from renewable sources...it produces no harmful CO2 emissions when burned; the only byproducts are heat and pure water. We are at the dawn of a new economy, using hydrogen as the energy carrier, which will fundamentally change the nature of our financial markets, political and social institutions, just as coal and steam power did at the beginning of the Industrial Age...  People often ask: Why generate electricity twice, first to produce electricity for the process of electrolytic hydrogen and then again to produce electricity and heat in a fuel cell? The reason is that electricity can be stored only in batteries, which are cumbersome to transport and slow to recharge, while hydrogen can be stored at much lower cost. Internal-combustion engines capture only 15 to 20 percent of the energy in gasoline, and the conventional electric power grid is only 33 percent efficient...  The hydrogen economy makes possible a vast redistribution of electricity, with far-reaching consequences for society. Today's centralized, top-down flow of energy, controlled by global oil companies and utilities, can become obsolete. In the new era, every human being with access to renewable energy sources could become a producer as well as a consumer—using so-called 'distributed generation.' When millions of end-users connect their fuel cells powered by renewables into local, regional and national publicly owned hydrogen energy webs (HEWs), they can begin to share energy—peer-to-peer—creating a new decentralized form of energy generation and use... The hydrogen economy is within sight. How fast we get there will depend on how committed we are to weaning ourselves off of oil and the other fossil fuels. What are we waiting for?"""

01	Should the US Increase Its Use of Natural Gas?	"""Natural gas is the fastest growing fuel in the United States. Considering the lower levels of CO2 and other emissions resulting from natural gas, it creates less concern for global climate change (GCC) than coal or oil making it the most environmentally attractive fossil fuel. Nine hundred of the next one thousand power plants in the United States will use natural gas. It is also becoming more popular as a transportation fuel with manufacturers such as Honda manufacturing compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and more gas stations starting to carry CNG (especially in California)...  Fossil fuels can also be integrated with renewables. For example, Victorville II, a hybrid solar/natural gas power plant that is being built in California, will supplement its natural gas generation with solar electricity. Natural gas power plants can be used to supplement wind energy when the wind isn't blowing. By integrating fossil fuels with renewable energy, fossil fuel energy can be slowly phased out as it becomes more costly while renewable energy is increased as it becomes more cost efficient...  As energy consumption continues to increase, global climate change and other factors make natural gas a viable transitional fuel for reducing CO2 and other harmful emissions and bridging the gap in energy need as technology and markets for renewable fuels develop."""

This presumably represents a persistent negative effect of low milk intake during growth on bone mass and density of the hip that is not completely ameliorated by current calcium or milk intake. Furthermore, among women 50 years of age or older, those with low milk intake during childhood had a 2-fold greater risk of fracture than did women with high milk intake during childhood...  We found that milk intake in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased bone mass and density in adulthood, and this effect is independent of current milk or calcium intake.

10	Do Teens Use Performance Enhancing Drugs to Emulate Their Professional Athlete Role Models?	"""Sports talk radio is fond of throwing out the argument that steroid use among pro athletes translates into use among the high school athletes who emulate them. Rep.

Steroid hysterics in Congress would say it goes something like this: The press reports on pros using steroids; teens learn about steroids in the pros, but the coverage is negative; Congress sends kids a clear signal that steroids won't be tolerated in the pros; and what would have been a rising tide of steroid users is abated.   But then again, it could go like this: The media exposes the use of steroids in the pros; thanks to the coverage, more kids try steroids than would do so otherwise; and a downward turn in teen steroid use instead trends up to flat. Maybe both scenarios influence use and cancel each other out. Maybe neither factor in at all. It's fun to play speculative games, but at the end of the day, despite Waxman's assertions, there's no proven correlation...   In other words, kids may undervalue long term risk and overvalue short term gain, but they aren't morons. Those who use steroids seem to care most about what steroids can do for them, not about emulating the figures on baseball cards."""

The good news is that we have the knowledge, technology, and capacity to make the shift to a renewable energy path—it all hinges on growing solar power.  Solar energy is essential to a renewable energy future. Even after we achieve all possible energy-efficiency gains and take full advantage of other renewable energy sources, such as wind and geothermal, we’ll still need some other way to generate at least 30 percent of our power.

01	Can Hormones Affect Sexual Orientation?	latest research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Madrid on Monday, came from a clinic which is one of only two in the UK to offer fertility treatment to lesbian women. Doctors there noticed a ‘staggering’ number of lesbian women, who, on investigation, were found to be suffering either from polycystic ovary syndrome, or a less serious but related condition in which their ovaries showed many of the same features, but without the external symptoms. The researchers found that prevalence of this symptomless condition was 80% in the lesbian women they saw, compared with just 32% of their heterosexual patients. Full-blown polycystic ovarian syndrome was present in 38% of lesbians, and 14% of the heterosexual women. Lead researcher Dr Rina Agrawal said that the results suggested ‘significantly greater’ rates of hormone imbalance in the lesbian women. She said that while there was no evidence that polycystic ovaries could be implicated as a cause of lesbianism, it was possible that this hormone imbalance could be linked to both the medical condition and sexuality. She said: ‘We do hypothesize that hyperandrogenism, which is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, may be one of the factors contributing to the sexual orientation of women.'”

Many innovations that would surely improve performance are banned outright. An athlete who showed up for the Boston Marathon wearing Rollerblades would be wheeled right off the start line...  Rules are changed at times to preserve a sport. Basketball banned goaltending—swatting the ball away just as it was about to go into the hoop—when players became so tall and athletic that they could stand by the basket and prevent most shots from having a chance to go in...  When performance-enhancing drugs have the power to overcome differences in natural talents and the willingness to sacrifice and persevere in the quest to perfect those talents, we cannot avoid confronting the question, What do we value in sport? Emerging technologies—from hypoxic chambers and carbon fiber prostheses to genetic manipulation—will force us [to] consider what, after all, is the point of sport?...Sports that revere records and historical comparisons (think of baseball and home runs) would become unmoored by drug-aided athletes obliterating old standards.

01	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a ‘Second Bill of Rights’ for Americans, declaring ‘freedom from want’ to be one of four essential liberties necessary for human security. Roosevelt’s definition of freedom included ‘the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.’ Unfortunately, the United States turned its back on Roosevelt’s vision, and as a result our health care system is in a state of ever-deepening crisis. Despite spending far more per capita on health care than any other country, U.S. has some of the poorest health indicators in the industrialized world. It is the only industrialized nation to deny its citizens universal access to medical services… This record can be largely attributed to the notion that health care is simply one commodity among others, a privilege for those who can afford it rather than a fundamental human right for all. With a system that values profits over people, it is no surprise that health care costs continue to spiral out of control for ordinary Americans even as HMOs and pharmaceutical companies accumulate record-breaking profits.

10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	Social media enables cheating on school assignments. Students in California, New York City, and Houston posted photos of standardized tests to social media sites, allowing students who had not yet taken the tests to see the questions (and potentially find answers) ahead of time. [82] The SAT has had similar problems with students posting parts of the exam to social media. [125][126] In Mar. 2015, two students in Maryland were accused of cheating on the 10th grade Common Core tests by posting questions on Twitter. Pearson, a company that administers standardized tests, identified 76 cases of students posting test materials online spanning six states in the first three months of 2015. [185] Read More
10	Is Wind Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""Wind energy is and will remain expensive because of the combined properties of wind turbines...  The price [of wind energy] is of course related to the capacity, to the maximum power of the machine [wind turbine], and is the price for 100% power. Over a given year, however, the turbine will produce on average only 25-30% of its power capacity. This means that of the price for 100% power, about 70-75% is flung to the winds, so to speak. The 70-75% on average does not produce a single kWh. On top of that, the dismal amount of the product, the kWhs, is of very poor 'quality'... and on many days not available at all. This is the worst property for an electricity supply to have, making it unviable for supply to single consumers, a factory, a hospital or a household. Such a dismal product is of course of reduced value on the energy market and can only be sold at a reduced price, making massive subsidies necessary. These subsidies are paid by the general public."""
10	Is the ACLU Good for America?	ACLU is attempting to steal our Judeo-Christian history so it can steal our country. Citizen pressure needs to be applied to force Congress to use every weapon at its disposal – including its Article III power to define jurisdiction of federal courts, a constitutional amendment, regulations to enforce existing laws, and the withholding of taxpayers’ money from counties or states that try undermining our Judeo-Christian heritage.”
01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence. The more than 100,000 people shot in the United States each year generate emergency room and hospital charges of nearly $3 billion. [163] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [21] A study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries cost Medicaid and Medicare $2.7 billion over nine years. [22] 84% of those injured by firearms are uninsured, leaving taxpayers responsible for most of those bills through programs like Medicaid. [23][24][25][26] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the costs of gun violence can include legal services, medical costs, perpetrator control, policing, incarceration, foster care, private security, lost earnings and time, life insurance, productivity, tourism, and psychological costs (pain and suffering), among others. [25] Homicide rates doubling has been associated with a 12.5% decline in property values. [25] Read More
10	Is There Pus in Milk?	"""On the surface, somatic cell counts seem like a topic that would interest only dairy farmers, veterinarians, and dairy processors. The impact of somatic cell counts on protein levels and cheese making seems far removed from things a consumer might think about while visiting the grocery store.  Enter People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and its 'Got Pus?' campaign, which attempts to 'alert consumers to impurities in the U.S. milk supply, particularly the high levels of bacteria-harboring pus.' Their so-called proof? Somatic cell counts...   [PETA] goes on to discuss the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance and even uses a state-by-state list of average SC [somatic cell] counts published by Hoard's Dairyman as 'evidence.' These activists are asking the public to abandon milk - one of the most tested, wholesome, and nutritious foods available.  The dairy checkoff is working to make sure consumers are not swayed by PETA's ridiculous and incorrect claims. There is no pus in milk."""
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""Constitutional protection for a right to assisted suicide might spawn pressure on the elderly and infirm--but still happily alive--to 'die and get out of the way.' Also at risk are the poor and minorities, who have been shown to suffer more pain (i.e. they receive less treatment for their pain) than other groups... Further, like the elderly and infirm, they, as well as the handicapped, are at risk of being unwanted and subjected to pressure to choose physician-assisted suicide rather than continued treatment...   The poor, the elderly, the disabled and minorities are all at risk from undue pressure to commit physician-assisted suicide, either through direct pressure or through inadequate treatment of their pain and suffering. They cannot be adequately protected by procedural safeguards, if the Dutch experience is any indication. The only way to achieve adequate protection for these groups is to maintain a bright-line rule against physician-assisted suicide."""
10	Does the US Congress Have Authority to Legislate Felon Enfranchisement in Federal Elections?	"""Most prominently, the 14th Amendment makes felon voting a state prerogative, not a federal one...  The senators' bill [Count Every Vote Act of 2005], by contrast, tosses out the Constitution and declares in no uncertain terms that felon voting should be a federal issue...  If voters choose to change state laws regarding felons and voting, it's their prerogative. Federalism allows for such state-level experimentation, and it's at the state level where the consequences of new felon-voting laws will best be judged. Congress should let the process play itself out, as the Constitution allows it to."""
10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Unpasteurized dairy products are responsible for almost all [95%] of the 761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations in the United States that occur annually because of dairy-related outbreaks caused by STEC [E.coli], Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes [Listeria], and Campylobacter spp... Consumers of unpasteurized milk and cheese are a small proportion of the US population (3.2% and 1.6%, respectively), but compared with consumers of pasteurized dairy products, they are 838.8 times more likely to experience an illness and 45.1 times more likely to be hospitalized...  An easing of regulations has allowed greater access to unpasteurized milk in recent years, and this study shows that illnesses and hospitalizations will rise as consumption of unpasteurized dairy products increases. If such consumption were to double, the mean number of outbreak-related illnesses that occur every year would increase by 96%. Most unpasteurized dairy-related outbreaks are caused by pathogen contamination at the dairy farm."""
01	Do Senior Citizens Feel Comfortable Using Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Today marks the first day of early voting, and many senior citizens are gearing up for the move from paper ballots to electronic voting. 'I think it's going to be great!

A lot of people who moved here from up North had the touch-screen system, so it should not be a problem for them,' said Phyllis Smith...  George Florea, a Horseshoe Bend city councilman, said he saw the touch-screen voting machine when it was brought to the city council meeting. 'I think it will be good once people learn how to use them. I think it's a step forward.' Starling Burke, a resident of Melbourne, is also positive about it. 'It doesn't intimidate me at all. I've been involved with it (touch-screen) before.'"""
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""American society has never sanctioned assisted suicide or mercy killing. We believe that the practices would be profoundly dangerous for large segments of the population, especially in light of the widespread failure of American medicine to treat pain adequately or to diagnose and treat depression in many cases. The risks would extend to all individuals who are ill. They would be most severe for those whose autonomy and well-being are already compromised by poverty, lack of access to good medical care, or membership in a stigmatized social group. The risks of legalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia for these individuals, in a health care system and society that cannot effectively protect against the impact of inadequate resources and ingrained social disadvantage, are likely to be extraordinary."""
10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	"A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines.

"""[I]t would defy reason to conclude that the members of the First Congress, who drafted the Establishment Clause, thought it to be violated by appending the words 'so help me God' to the presidential oath, when they included precisely those words in the judicial oath...  [T]he Supreme Court has unreservedly described oaths ending with the words 'so help me God' as consistent with the Establishment Clause, and has used them as a benchmark to measure the constitutionality of other government action...  That interest [the public interest] is best served by allowing the inaugural ceremony to proceed as planned, and in a manner wholly consistent with the practice of prayer at presidential inaugurations, and the affirmation 'so help me God,' that stretch back to President Washington's First Inauguration in 1789. There is no reason to 'reverse course' and abandon these longstanding and widely-accepted aspects of the inaugural ceremony."""
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Alcohol is widely available, so it is widely abused. If the Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act (RTMA) passes, marijuana will become just as available. The harm to our youth will be devastating. Proponents like to trot out a survey showing marijuana use among American teens hasn’t risen in the last few years. That’s because marijuana remains illegal across most of the United States. In those states that have legalized recreational marijuana, teen usage rates have skyrocketed. In Colorado, teen use of marijuana is 74 percent higher than the national average. This comes with a huge price. The teen brain is still developing, so any intoxicating substance causes more damage than it does to an adult’s brain. THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, causes impaired coordination, difficulty with thinking and problem solving and disrupted learning and memory. After smoking marijuana, a teen’s thinking abilities bounce back more slowly than an adult’s. Regular use leads to a permanent decrease in learning capabilities, a shortened attention span and an impaired ability to effectively communicate. Researchers have also linked youth use of marijuana to mental illness and psychosis… Legal marijuana will only tempt more teens. In their inexperience, they will drive or take other foolish risks. Not looking beyond today, they will sacrifice their potential. And we all will lose. Legalizing marijuana is a bad idea for adults. But the consequences for our youth will be worse.”
10	Should the US have attacked Iraq?	"""There is no justification under international law for the use of military force against Iraq. The UN charter outlaws the use of force with only two exceptions: individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack and action authorised by the security council as a collective response to a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression. There are currently no grounds for a claim to use such force in self-defence. The doctrine of pre-emptive self-defence against an attack that might arise at some hypothetical future time has no basis in international law."""

10	Are Mass Deportations a Good Method to Address Illegal Immigration?	"""Locating millions of immigrants for deportation would take a very dramatic increase in domestic surveillance and enforcement, including door-to-door roundups. Mistakes would inevitably be made, with legal immigrants and citizens swept up in the process. Courts that handle immigration cases would be overwhelmed.   Mass deportations would also harm the economy. Most undocumented workers are in relatively low-skilled jobs, but about a quarter are in white-collar jobs. Of those, about half are in management, finance or professional careers. Removing large numbers would have a very significant impact on the businesses that employ them. Undocumented workers make up about 5.1% of the American workforce at a time when a 4.9% unemployment rate shows that labor markets are growing tight."""

01	Does Clemency Serve as a Safeguard in Capital Punishment Cases?	"""Clemency is deeply rooted in our Anglo American tradition of law, and is the historic remedy for preventing miscarriages of justice where judicial process has been exhausted...  Executive clemency has provided the 'fail safe' in our criminal justice system. It is an unalterable fact that our judicial system, like the human beings who administer it, is fallible. But history is replete with examples of wrongfully convicted persons who have been pardoned in the wake of after discovered evidence establishing their innocence... Recent authority confirms that over the past century clemency has been exercised frequently in capital cases in which demonstrations of 'actual innocence' have been made...  History shows that the traditional remedy for claims of innocence based on new evidence, discovered too late in the day to file a new trial motion, has been executive clemency."""
01	Is a College Education Worth It?	"People who do not go to college are more likely to be unemployed and, therefore, place undue financial strain on society, making a college degree worth it to taxpayers. Young people ""not engaged in employment/education or training,"" AKA NEET, are more likely to receive welfare than youth in general, they are more likely to commit crimes, and they are more likely to receive public health care, all costing the government extra money. In total, each NEET youth between the ages of 16 and 25 impose a $51,350 financial burden on society per year, and after the person is 25 he or she will impose a financial burden of $699,770.

10	Will Increased Oil Drilling Help the US Solve Its Energy Crisis?	"""Republicans in Washington only offer more drilling - even though 68 million acres of federal oil reserves are already open and leased for development, but oil companies have decided it's not worth the money to drill there. New drilling won't lower prices for years to come. Drilling in the pristine Alaskan Wildlife Refuge wouldn't yield any oil for 10 years - and in 22 years would only save consumers about 2 cents a gallon. Even John McCain won't drill there. The bottom line: America has only 1.6% of the world's oil supply, but we use 24% - so drilling isn't much of a solution at all."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In order to use labor laws to protect women in the sex industry, the legal status of prostitution and its offshoots--brothel keeping, pimping, soliciting, paying for sex--would need to be re-examined. After all, the Department of Justice does not ensure minimum wages for drug runners or concern itself with working conditions in the Mob.   But whether or not we approve of sex work or would want our daughters to be thus employed, the moral argument for condemnation starts to fall apart when we consider the conditions of abuse suffered by real women working in the industry. Criminalization has been as unsuccessful in dismantling the sex industry as it has been in eliminating the drug trade and preventing back-alley abortions.  Sex work is here to stay, and by recognizing it as paid labor governments can guarantee fair treatment as well as safe and healthy work environments--including overtime and vacation pay, control over condom use, and the right to collective bargaining."""

Studies of vegetarians show that death rates from cancer are only about one-half to three-quarters of the general population’s death rates… Vegetarians are less likely to form either kidney stones or gallstones. In addition, vegetarians may also be at lower risk for osteoporosis because they eat little or no animal protein… It’s easy to plan vegetarian diets that meet all your nutrient needs.”
01	Is the United States a Christian Nation?	"""During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt prayed over national airwaves to 'Almighty God' for the success of the D-Day invasion and the war effort in a manner that today would surely unleash a torrent of protest. Roosevelt's prayer begged God's blessing in America's 'struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization.'   That's right. Our religion. It wasn't Hinduism or Shintoism that President Roosevelt had in mind when he uttered that phrase. It was America's Judeo-Christian beliefs, which have been a pillar of our society since the nation's founding.  Current attempts to deny, stifle, and eradicate Christianity are a much more recent aberration. Still, today the official U.S. Military Code of Conduct (Article Six) states: 'I will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God and in the United States of America.'"""
10	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""Cities and states have various policies regarding local enforcement of federal immigration laws, and the expenditure of local resources on cooperation with ICE enforcement programs. These policies seek to preserve trust between local law enforcement organizations and the communities they serve, which is undermined when individuals fear that local law enforcement will enforce federal immigration laws. These policies also seek to preserve the limited financial resources available to state and local governments. Though they take many forms, these policies include limitations on local law enforcement making arrests based on immigration violations, limitations on local law enforcement gathering information about immigration status, compliance with ICE detainers, and sharing certain information with ICE, including an individual’s custody status or release date from local custody.   Any future efforts by the federal government to limit or defeat these local policies will likely face challenges under the Tenth Amendment and Spending Clause of the Constitution. Any attempts to directly compel local law enforcement to comply with ICE detainers or other enforcement provisions are likely to be struck down. Attempts to cut off all federal funding to jurisdictions with local policies limiting local enforcement will likely be found to exceed Congressional power under the Spending Clause, as will attempts to cut off large, general grants unrelated to immigration enforcement."""

The idea would be for MLB to make adjustments to baseball's statistics (and record books) when cheating can be proven...  The best part of this plan is that after the numbers are adjusted to reflect the player's non-using seasons, the stats of Bonds and Clemens would still be good enough to earn them their rightful place in the Hall of Fame. Face it, had neither player ever touched a steroid, and retired in a normal time frame, each would already be in the Hall. That's how it should be."""

We see the current price crisis playing out in streets and homes around the world, and it demands our swift action...  The United States is deeply concerned by the current crisis. The United States has a long history of working closely with our international partners to support the vulnerable and save lives...  Many concerns have been expressed about the impact of biofuels on food security.  However, increased biofuels production is but one of many contributing factors to increased food prices.  The use of sustainable biofuels can increase energy security, foster economic development especially in rural areas, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without weighing heavily on food prices.  The U.S. continues to lead on this issue. A recently passed law requires that we minimize possible food security and environmental concerns, in part through significant investment in next-generation biofuel technologies that do not rely on grains and oilseeds used for food or feed."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""No person's human or civil rights should be violated on the basis of their trade, occupation, work, calling or profession.  No law has ever succeeded in stopping prostitution.   Prostitution is the provision of sexual services for negotiated payment between consenting adults. So defined, prostitution is a service industry like any other in which people exchange skills for money or other reward...  Non-consenting adults and all children forced into sexual activity (commercial or otherwise) deserve the full protection of the law and perpetrators deserve full punishment by the law.  Workers in the sex industry deserve the same rights as workers in any other trade, including the right to legal protection from crimes such as sexual harassment, sexual abuse and rape...  There are some unscrupulous people in all walks of life -government, law, journalism, banking, law enforcement, the stock exchange, medicine, the clergy, prostitution, etc. If every profession were criminalised when some of its members broke the law, there would be few legally sanctioned professions. Unscrupulous people should be summarily dealt with by the law, regardless of which profession they corrupt."""

10	Should Victims' Opinions Matter When Considering the Death Penalty?	"""No one wants to be deemed callous to the pain of victims or their survivors. But over-sensitivity to their rage or grief qua victims creates the risk of losing the distinction between retribution and revenge. To the extent this is true, we must be careful because the claims of victims as victims are of little retributive significance...  In the context of the death penalty, the fear of victim influence on sentencing looms even more menacingly... it is purely speculative --if not illusory-- to assert that the death or cruel punishment of the offender will necessarily achieve that healing, or that other means will not provide the closure victims seek... In sum... the preferences of victims or their survivors should not enjoy special consideration in determining the death (or life) of the offender."""

"""[W]hether or not there is clear and conclusive evidence that members of Congress or our staffs have benefitted financially from insider information and whether or not the SEC believes it can act against members of Congress under its existing authority, there ought to be a law that explicitly deters such unethical, illegal behavior by members of Congress and punishes it when it happens…  Adopting a new law that explicitly makes insider trading by members of Congress illegal would strengthen the ‘foundations of our national policy’ and I hope, in a small way, help repair the breach that exists today between our government and our people.”"
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Despite the commonly held perception that minimum wage laws reduce income inequality and provide the poor with a better life, the real effects are the opposite. Minimum wage laws have proven detrimental by reducing job creation and the total hours worked for low-skilled workers, who are primarily paid the minimum wage and have less than a high school diploma or little work experience. And the laws raise prices for everyone – thus widening income inequality… Lower-skilled workers are especially vulnerable to the proven job losses caused by federal minimum wage increases because employers who can’t afford the increases in the cost of production simply close up shop, reduce employee hours, or even switch to automation. A recent study on the effects of minimum wage raises in California using data from 1990 to 2016 showed that a 10% increase in the minimum wage could contribute to a 3.4% reduction in employment. Key industries hit hardest are restaurants and retail stores that typically operate on razor-thin profit margins and often hire low-skilled workers and those new to the workforce.”

According to Rob Behler, an engineer hired as a contractor to work in Diebold's Georgia warehouse last year, the Diebold systems had major functioning problems... Behler said Diebold provided warehouse workers with at least three patches to apply to the systems before state officials began logic and accuracy testing on them. Behler said one patch was applied to the machines when he came to the warehouse in June, a second patch was applied in July and a third in August after he left the warehouse...  Behler said the patches he applied were never certified. No third party, other than the Diebold engineers who created the patches, knew what was in the patches.

01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“Amid the dashed hopes and the scandals and the bitterness, a great deal of real work was done. Bill Clinton conducted a serious, substantive presidency; his domestic policy achievements were not inconsiderable and were accomplished against great odds. He had rescued the Democratic party from irrelevance and pursued a new philosophy of governance that made public-sector activism plausible once more… Moreover, he performed the most important service that a leader can provide: He saw the world clearly and reacted prudently to the challenges he faced; he explained a complicated economic transformation to the American people and brought them to the edge of a new era.”
10	Is Global Oil Production at (or past) Its Peak?	"""Recently, numerous publications have appeared warning that oil production is near an unavoidable, geologically determined peak that could have consequences up to and including 'war, starvation, economic recession, possibly even the extinction of homo sapiens' (Colin Campbell in Ruppert 2002 [Michael Ruppert interview of Colin Campbell]). The current series of alarmist articles could be said to be merely reincarnations of earlier work, which proved fallacious, but the authors insist that they have made significant advances in their analyses, overcoming earlier errors...  Some of the arguments about resource scarcity resemble those made in the 1970s. They have noted that discoveries are low and that most estimates of ultimately recoverable resources (URR) are in the neighborhood of 2 trillion bbl, about twice production to date..  The primary flaw in Hubbert-type models is a reliance on URR as a static number rather than a dynamic variable, changing with technology, knowledge, infrastructure, and other factors, but primarily growing...  The result has been exactly as predicted in Lynch (1996) for this method: a series of predictions of near-term peak and decline, which have had to be repeatedly revised upwards and into the future. So much so as to suggest that the authors themselves are providing evidence that oil resources are under no strain, but increasing faster than consumption...  [T]here is no peak visible for non-OPEC oil production (absent a price collapse), let alone global production."""
10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Allow for Meaningful Audits?	"""Every voting unit used for an election must now produce a permanent paper record for each vote cast as part of an audit trail...

If there is anything that went wrong during the election, such as touch-screen calibration misalignment or 'lost votes,' as found in many of the systems used in the 2002 elections in Florida and Georgia, there is no way that it can be discovered or recovered."""
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""There is only one solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if 'solution' means ending the conflict, and that is two states for two peoples. This is axiomatic [self-evident/unquestionable] because this conflict is between two national movements which have proven their willingness to fight, die and kill so that each could have a territorial expression of their identity. Each side is fighting for a land they can call their own, on which they express their identity, and through which their identity is expressed. Both movements are fighting over the same piece of land. The option of one united peaceful state with a homogenized identity – the United States of Israel-Palestine – is not real because neither side wants a homogenized identity; both sides are willing to continue to fight, with even more passion and venom so that the one state takes on their own identity.   When I meet Israelis and Palestinians who advocate the so-called 'one state solution,' as soon as I dig below the nice slogans, what I find is that the Israelis are talking about a Jewish state with a large Arab minority and the Palestinians are talking about a Palestinian state with a large Jewish minority. Neither side of the so-called 'one-staters' is really willing to give up its dream of the territorial expression of its identity.  So like it or not… we do not have a choice – there has to be a two-state solution, and obviously the longer we procrastinate in making the hard decisions, the more difficult it will be."""
01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“From the discovery of antibiotics, analgesics, anti-depressants, and anesthetics, to the successful development of organ transplants, bypass surgery, heart catheterization, and joint replacement, practically every present-day protocol for the prevention, control, and cure of disease is based on knowledge attained through research with laboratory animals… Animal research has also paid incalculable benefits to animals.

Pacemakers, artificial joints, organ transplants, and freedom from arthritic pain are just a few of the breakthroughs made in veterinary medicine thanks to animal research. Dogs, cats, sheep, and cattle are also living longer and healthier lives thanks to vaccines for rabies, distemper, parvo virus, hepatitis, anthrax, tetanus, and feline leukemia.

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"A majority of Americans support legalizing marijuana. A 2018 Gallup poll found a record-high 66% support for legalizing marijuana, up from 12% in 1969, the first year the polling company asked about marijuana. [249] The poll first surpassed 50% support in 2011. According to Gallup, ""the transformation in public attitudes about marijuana over the past half-century has mirrored the liberalization of public attitudes about gay rights and the same-sex-marriage movement."" [67] While Democrats (72%) and Independents (67%) have been more likely to back legalization, a majority of Republicans (51%) now agree. [67] Polls by CBS News and the AP both found that 61% of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. [68][170] The public clearly supports changing our failed anti-marijuana policies.

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected. If we assume that he or she takes only 4 weeks to become positive, because there is an additional lag time of 1-2 weeks to get the results back, there will be at best a window period of 6 weeks for a prostitute. The average prostitute services between 10-15 clients per day. This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution."""

01	Can Marijuana Use Harm Female Fertility?	know that sperm capacitation and fertilising potential are tightly regulated within the female reproductive tract. Within the uterus, anandamide [a naturally occurring endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitter found in the brain, which is sensitive to the cannabinoids in marijuana] regulates early development of the fertilised egg, and determines where the embryo will implant to initiate pregnancy. Cannabinoids also affect this process… The increased load of cannabinoids in people who abuse marijuana could flood natural endocannabinoid-signal systems in reproductive organs and adversely impact fertility.”

In 1996, our immigration system made deportation a mandatory punishment for many non-citizens... judges do not have a say in deciding if deportation is fair... Families must choose between splitting up, resulting in more single parent households and psychological and financial hardship, or forcing their U.S. citizen children into deportation with them. These American children may have to start over in a country with a new language, fewer resources and an uncertain future. America’s immigration laws force American children to lose their parent, or their country. Mandatory deportation is a life sentence of exile. Such a severe 'one size fits all' punishment cannot be the basis of our immigration system."""
10	Should the US Subsidize Alternative Energies?	"""The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently released a report agreeing with the renewable industries' dual claim that even though technologies like wind and solar power are now cost-competitive with conventional energy sources, governments should continue to subsidize them. This rhetoric suggests that American taxpayer dollars should continue to prop up the profitability of select companies compared with what the free market would objectively and more efficiently determine…  As with the financial sector, renewables have had a boom led by government intervention and hedging that may ultimately bust as markets can't efficiently work. This would not only threaten the reliability and price of electricity, but it would also come at the expense of taxpayers. Further, the IEA's assertion to subsidize renewables to keep them cost-competitive makes the strongest possible statement against subsidizing them."""

Tuition is only one expense college students have to pay and accounts for 39.5% of total average college costs. [22] On average, in-state tuition at a public college costs $10,230 for each year. Fees, room, and board for on-campus housing are another $11,140. [23] Books and supplies are another $1,240, transportation adds $1,160, and other expenses cost another $2,120. Without tuition, college still costs an average of $15,660 per year. [22] Tuition accounts for just one-fifth of the average community college student's budget, which runs $17,930 annually on average.

10	Does Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) Apply to Felon Disenfranchisement Laws?	"""Here there are persuasive reasons to believe that Congress did not intend to include felon disenfranchisement provisions within the coverage of the Voting Rights Act, and we must therefore look beyond the plain text of the statute in construing the reach of its provisions...   These reasons include:   1. the explicit approval given such laws in the Fourteenth Amendment;   2. the long history and continuing prevalence of felon disenfranchisement provisions throughout the United States;   3. the statements in the House and Senate Judiciary Committee Reports and on the Senate floor explicitly excluding felon disenfranchisement laws from provisions of the statute;   4. the absence of any affirmative consideration of felon disenfranchisement laws during either the 1965 passage of the Act or its 1982 revision;   5. the introduction thereafter of bills specifically intended to include felon disenfranchisement provisions within the VRA's coverage; the enactment of a felon disenfranchisement statute for the District of Columbia by Congress soon after the passage of the Voting Rights Act; and   6. the subsequent passage of statutes designed to facilitate the removal of convicted felons from the voting rolls.   We therefore conclude that [The Voting Rights Act] was not intended to - and thus does not - encompass felon disenfranchisement provisions."""
01	Does Hinduism Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	ancient Hindu scriptures describe the homosexual condition to be a biological one, and although the scripture gives guidance to parents on how to avoid procreating a homosexual child, it does not condemn the child as unnatural… According to the scripture the sex of a child is determined by whether the fire element is dominant or the water element is dominant. Thus during those even nights the fire element dominates giving a male conception and during those odd nights the water element gives a female conception. However, if the fire element equals the water element then a homosexual conception takes place. The point here is that the homosexual nature is part of the natural law of God; it should be accepted for what it is, no more and no less… Homosexuals are full human beings, who in Hinduism even worship their own deity, the Mother Goddess Bahuchara, for their spiritual link to the Absolute Brahm.”

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	Marijuana legalization boosts the economy. The marijuana industry (adult-use and medical) in the United States could exceed $24 billion in revenue by 2025. [7] For every $1.00 spent in the marijuana industry, between $2.13 and $2.40 in economic activity is generated. [1][2] Tourism, banking, food, real estate, construction, and transportation are a few of the industries that benefit from legal marijuana. [3] The legal marijuana industry generated $7.2 billion in economic activity in 2016, and added millions of dollars in federal taxes paid by cannabis businesses. [20] One study on adult-use marijuana in Nevada projected $7.5 billion in economic activity over the first seven years of legalization, including $1.7 billion in labor income. [4] A study by the University of California Agricultural Issues Center estimated that the legal marijuana market in California could generate $5 billion annually. [5][6] In Colorado, marijuana brings in three times more tax revenue than alcohol. [15] The state raised $78 million in the first fiscal year after starting retail sales, and $129 million the second fiscal year. Washington collected a total of $220 million in tax revenues in its second fiscal year of sales. [53][52] Read More
10	Can a Child’s Relationship with His or Her Parents Cause Homosexuality?	most influential source of the ‘absent father/overprotective mother’ theory of homosexuality, was a research project conducted by psychoanalyst Irving Bieber in the late 1960’s… His conclusion was that male homosexuality is caused by ‘paternal hostility and engulfing maternalism.’ Mothers of gay men were found to be seductive, babying, and controlling: fathers were distant, competitive, or hostile… This was hardly a representative sample of gay men… the people who filled out the questionnaires that provided the ‘data’ were not the gay patients, but their psychiatrists. No gay men were allowed to speak for themselves about their own lives. This ‘research,’ then, turns out to be nothing more than an elaborate opinion poll of psychoanalysts in the sixties, who had already been trained to believe that gay people were suffering from ‘perversion,’ … Despite the fact that Bieber’s conclusions were repudiated by mainstream psychology and psychiatry decades ago, the fringe, Christian right ‘reparative therapy’ movement continues to cite them in support of their ‘treatment.’ Moreover, Bieber’s theories have seeped into the collective culture, and have become part of our folklore… For gay men who have been affected by these ideas, it can be helpful to look back at how they originated, and to understand that the ‘scientific foundations’ of these conclusions are composed of nothing more substantial than hot air.”

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	Returning to a gold standard would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, given the scarcity of gold and the vast amount of money already in circulation in the United States. As of 2012 the US treasury held about 260 million troy ounces of gold reserves. At the market price of gold, about $1,662 an ounce (as of Dec. 27, 2012), that would equal about $434.6 billion in gold. However, the current United States money supply, including cash in circulation and bank deposits, is about $2.6 trillion. In order to peg the dollar to gold, the United States would either have to vastly increase its gold holdings, set the dollar price of gold at $10,000 an ounce, or suffer a massive deflation and contraction in the money supply (or some combination of the three). [65] All the gold that currently exists in the world - about 5.5 billion troy ounces - would be worth about $9.1 trillion dollars at current market prices. [1] Even that is not enough to cover the $16.3 trillion national debt of the United States. [31] Read More

10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""There is plenty of reason to believe that Congress's proposed stimulus package will not work…  First and foremost, it should be noted that a green stimulus is an inherent contradiction in terms. The environmental movement itself is, by design, anti-growth. After all, these are the individuals and organizations that regularly fight to stop new factories, power plants, and construction projects…  Part of the green stimulus involves using taxpayer dollars to subsidize renewable energy, especially wind and solar for electric generation and biofuels for transportation. This would backfire and hurt the economy. It is well established that affordable energy is critical to economic health, and higher energy costs will hurt the prospects for an economic recovery and post-recovery growth. But virtually all of the alternative energy sources that are part of the green stimulus are more expensive than their conventional counterparts…  Support for renewables would likely cost more jobs than are created. For example, subsidies for wind and solar energy would, at least from the narrow perspective of the wind and solar industries, create new jobs as more of these systems are manufactured and installed. But the tax dollars needed to help pay for them cost jobs elsewhere, as would the pricey electricity they produce.  The only reason to consider promoting these renewables is for their environmental benefits, which are questionable in most cases. But the economic argument for saddling the nation with this costlier energy falls completely flat. Some suggest that an entire 'new' economy could be based on renewable energy sources, but the only thing new about it would be how weak and globally uncompetitive it is."""
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“A 7-year-old girl won’t make it to college someday because her teacher has two decades of experience or a master’s degree — she will make it to college if her teacher is effective and engaging and compels her to reach for success. By contrast, a poorly performing teacher can hold back hundreds, maybe thousands, of students over the course of a career. Each day that we ignore this reality is precious time lost for children preparing for the challenges of adulthood. The glacial process for removing an incompetent teacher — and our discomfort as a society with criticizing anyone who chooses this noble and difficult profession — has left our school districts impotent and, worse, has robbed millions of children of a real future. There isn’t a business in America that would survive if it couldn’t make personnel decisions based on performance. That is why everything we use in assessing teachers must be linked to their effectiveness in the classroom and focused on increasing student achievement.”
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	Tenure allows teachers to advocate on behalf of students and disagree openly with school and district administrators.

01	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""[T]he empirical slippery slope cannot be ignored when one looks at the facts across the world… [T]here remains a real possibility of the extension of euthanasia to infants, those with mental incapacities or disabilities, and the elderly…   Indeed, this has materialised to some degree, whether by a formal extension of categories of persons to whom euthanasia is allowed, or by loose application of criteria by personnel involved in the administration of euthanasia. For example, Belgium removed the age restriction for euthanasia in 2014; assisted death has extended beyond the line originally drawn by the law in the Netherlands to patients regarded as legally and mentally incompetent and the possibility of extension to those who are not terminally ill but feel their lives are complete is being considered; severe psychic pain in and otherwise healthy person has been thought sufficient ground for requesting euthanasia; and researchers have found cases of non-voluntary euthanasia in the form of the termination of lives of disabled infants in the Netherlands.  Denying euthanasia honours the sanctity of life and the equal, underived, intrinsic moral worth of all persons, including the very weakest who can no longer contribute to society – principles of which so many other laws pivot."""

10	Did Obamacare Allow Everyone to Keep Their Insurance Coverage? - NO	"""[A] problem that has received a lot of attention concerns Americans who have received letters from their insurers that they may be losing the plans they bought in the old individual market, often because they no longer meet the law's requirements to cover basic benefits...  I completely get how upsetting this can be for a lot of Americans, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked, they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I'm offering an idea that will help do it.  Already, people who have plans that predate the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven't changed. That was already in the law. That's what's called a grandfather clause. It was included in the law. Today, we're going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect, and to people who bought plans since the law took effect...  But the bottom line is, insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014, and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan...  Keep in mind that the individual market accounts for 5 percent of the population. So when I said you can keep your health care, I'm looking at folks who've got employer-based health care; I'm looking at folks who've got Medicare and Medicaid - and that accounts for the vast majority of Americans.""  [Editor's Note: Prior to the above statement, President Barack Obama had stated the following in a June 28, 2012 speech, ""Remarks by the President on Supreme Court Ruling on the Affordable Care Act,"" available at the White House website:  ""[I]f you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance - this law will only make it more secure and more affordable.""]"

Now that I have returned, I have undergone a change. I have visited Auschwitz… If you ask me now, ‘Should the American Nazi Party march in Skokie?’ my response is, ‘Never.’ If a group of distorted individuals want to walk around with signs saying that they hate Jews and blacks, such is their right. But if they flaunt the symbol that has been associated with the vile and inhumane acts to which Auschwitz stands witness, they are advocating the violation of humanity, and the violation of humanity should have no protection in any city, state or nation in the world.”
10	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""Modern separationists invoke the names of James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to 'prove' what the Founding Fathers intended. But Jefferson had nothing to do with the drafting of the Bill of Rights. Madison did, but the Religion Clauses were the work of someone else. The hallowed phrase 'wall of separation' does not appear in the Constitution, as some people seem to think, but in a private letter that Jefferson wrote some years later. For almost a century afterwards the 'wall' metaphor was largely ignored.  Those who believe the myth of strict separationism find it impossible to explain why we have military chaplains, prayers in courts and legislatures, the claim 'In God We Trust' on coins, an official Thanksgiving day, oaths that end 'so help me, God,' and many other things that bring religion into the public sphere...  Thus, not surprisingly, until 1948 the Supreme Court never found a violation of separation of church and state, and on numerous occasions it upheld arrangements whereby religion received official public support... The Court in 1947-8 made a revolution simply by bold assertion, without regard for historical or judicial evidence... Some of the leading constitutional scholars pointed this out at the time, but the new understanding of the First Amendment quickly became enshrined as definitive, and ever since separationists have reacted with shock and horror when anyone recalls how arbitrary these decisions really were.  How and why this happened in 1947-8 is a complicated story, but a key part of it is the fact that most of the Supreme Court justices who brought about this revolution, and many of the people who then enshrined it in our national, lore, frankly regarded traditional religion as outmoded and in some ways dangerous. They did not really care what the Founding Fathers intended, or what the real tradition of the country was. They simply believed that the time had come to marginalize religion. Those who today seek to undo some of the damage stemming from that fallacy are not undermining the Constitution but seeking to recover it."""
01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Scientific research requiring laboratory animals continues to result in spectacular achievements that have advanced our understanding of life and treatment of disease. Continued progress – to benefit human and animal health – requires further animal experimentation because there is, as yet, no single or array of alternative systems that permit the complete replacement for animals. Basic and applied research with animals provides invaluable and currently irreplaceable means to study human conditions because there are so many similarities between the physiology and genetics of animals and humans. While not all systems in animals and man are exactly the same, the differences in many cases are sufficiently small that animals can serve as relevant models for man or other species. Humane and responsible animal research offers the best hope for the development of new methods of prevention, treatment, cure and control of disease, pain and suffering. Animal based research is and will be, for the foreseeable future, indispensable to biomedical progress – for humans and animals.”
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“Radical innovation is suffering. We need to foster a generation of innovators. If your goal is to become an entrepreneur, it would seem that college has become a very bad place to do that… The academic world has historically been one of the few places where you could try things and have big ideas. One of the consequences of modernity is this hyper-specialization. The college experience is not incredibly helpful and is perhaps less helpful than it used to be… There’s definitely like an incredible importance to a well-rounded education, people learning about a whole range of topics… This is definitely the case for people like Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerburg. Like they’ve learned how to learn on their own outside of a structured environment.”

01	Is a College Education Worth It?	"College exposes students to diverse people and ideas. Students live, go to classes, and socialize with other students from around the world and learn from professors with a variety of expertise. The community of people on a college campus means students are likely to make diverse friends and business connections, and, potentially, find a spouse or mate. Access to a variety of people allows college students to learn about different cultures, religions, and personalities they may have not been exposed to in their home towns, which broadens their knowledge and perspective. 70.7% of college freshman in 2015 said they expected to socialize with someone of another racial or ethnic group while in college, while 59.1% said college would help improve their understanding of other countries and cultures. [106] In 2004, 79% of people with graduate degrees and 73% of college graduates thought it ""very important to try to understand the reasoning behind the opinions of others"" compared to 67% of associate degree holders, 64% of high school graduates, and 59% of high school drop-outs.

We’re an organization that’s been around for 86 years. We’re essentially a conservative organization. We defend the fundamental principles that are outlined in the Constitution and we do so for everyone regardless of their political inclinations, their sexual orientation, their national origins, and so I think because of that we tackle very unpopular causes. We represent people who espouse racist beliefs, people who have committed heinous crimes. We can’t really pick and choose who our clients are.”
01	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""Atheists will doubtless maintain that any public religion at all - like 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance - excludes them by endorsing the idea of religion generally. But this misses the point: it is an interpretive choice to feel excluded by other people's faiths, and the atheist, like any other dissenter from a majoritarian decision, can just as easily adhere to his own views while insisting on his full citizenship. So long as no one is coerced into invoking God, it makes little sense to accommodate the atheist's scruples by barring everyone else from saying words that he alone finds to be metaphysically empty. Complete subjective inclusion is impossible, so if our goal is to include as many people as possible, we need to reach as widely as possible by letting the ordinary democratic process take its course. The Jehovah's Witnesses, who in the 1940's fought for the right not to salute the flag, never insisted that the salute or the pledge should be abolished altogether - they just wanted their children to be exempt from a mandatory ritual that violated their consciences and hence their religious liberty."""

I continued to do prostitution for twenty years. I've always been involved in the grass roots movement to decriminalize prostitution--the political cause which is most near and dear to my heart.

01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	DTC prescription drug ads create revenue for drug companies, which can be used for research & development (R&D) to create new life-changing drugs. Drug development is expensive so pharmaceutical companies need to recoup that expense through advertising. For every $1 spent on DTC ads, sales of prescription drugs rose by $4.20. [35] In 2012, the pharmaceutical industry spent $3.1 billion on direct-to-consumer advertising. [47] On average, drug development for a single drug costs at least $4 billion and as much as $11 billion. [33] Drug companies that develop new drugs have a period of market exclusivity before generic drugs can be made by any company.

10	Should E-Verify, the Federal Government's Electronic Employment Verification System, Be Mandatory for All Employers?	"""Mandating employer use of E-Verify would push more workers into the underground, off-the-books, cash-based economy.

The unauthorized workers targeted by these measures are taxpayers, consumers, and job-creators. Decreasing their economic well-being will have depressive effects that ripple through the state's entire economy...  Mandating E- Verify for all employers will cause the error rate to expand and will be difficult to implement in an inexpensive and timely manner. Currently, E-Verify is used by only 7 percent of employers. Mandating that the remaining 93 percent of employers join the program would likely cause the error rate for all workers to increase, given the enormous expansion of E-Verify that such a mandate would require."""

10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""You can't fix a fundamentally broken law; you've got to replace it. That's why Congress can't save Obamacare with a few tweaks, despite what its defenders say. No quick fix can correct the main flaw: The law takes power away from patients and hands it to bureaucrats.  As millions of Americans have learned from their cancellation notices, Obamacare lets bureaucrats decide what insurance plans must cover. It buries doctors and hospitals in red tape. And it adds a whole host of new taxes and fees that drive up the cost of care. The law doesn't make people's health care decisions any easier; in many cases, it makes those decisions for them.  But the law's effects go far beyond the doctor's office, weighing down our economy and discouraging hiring. The law requires employers with more than 50 full-time employees to give them health insurance. But because the law defines 'full time' as 30 hours or more, employers are keeping employees below that threshold to avoid the mandate entirely."""

01	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	Because the United States is a very wealthy country, it should provide health care for all its citizens. Many European countries with a universal right to health care, such as France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, have a lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita than the United States, [127] yet they provide a right to health care for all their citizens.

10	Will Alternative Energy Development Increase US Energy Independence and Security?	"""[T]he idea that the United States, the world's single largest energy consumer, can be independent of the $5 trillion-per-year energy business -- the world's single biggest industry -- is ludicrous on its face. The push for energy independence is based on a series of false premises.  [Myth] 2 A big push for alternative fuels will break our oil addiction.  The new energy bill [Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, HR 6] requires that the country produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels per year by 2022. That sounds like a lot of fuel, but put it in perspective: The United States uses more than 320 billion gallons of oil per year, of which nearly 200 billion gallons are imported.  So biofuels alone cannot wean the United States off oil. Let's say the country converted all the soybeans grown by American farmers into biodiesel; that would provide only about 1.5 percent of total annual U.S. oil needs. And if the United States devoted its entire corn crop to producing ethanol, it would supply only about 6 percent of U.S. oil needs.  So what about cellulosic ethanol, the much-hyped biofuel that can be produced from grass, wood and other plant sources? Many in Congress believe that it will ride to the rescue. But the commercial viability of cellulosic ethanol is a bit like the tooth fairy: Many believe in it, but no one ever actually sees it. After all, even with heavy federal subsidies, it took 13 years before the corn-ethanol sector was able to produce 1 billion gallons of fuel per year. Two and a half decades elapsed before annual corn-ethanol production reached 5 billion gallons, as it did in 2006. But now Congress is demanding that the cellulosic-ethanol business magically produce many times that volume of fuel in just 15 years. It's not going to happen."""

However, scientific and anecdotal reports consistently indicate that smoking marijuana is a therapeutically preferable means of ingestion. Marinol is available in pill form only. Moreover, Marinol contains only one of the many ingredients found in marijuana (THC). It may be that the beneficial effects of THC are increased by the cumulative effect of additional substances found in cannabis. That is an area for future research. For whatever reason, smoking appears to result in faster, more effective relief, and dosage levels are more easily titrated and controlled in some patients.”

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“While expanding access to OCP [oral contraceptive pills] to help prevent unplanned pregnancies is a good idea, as a physician, there are many reasons I believe that making The Pill available over the counter is a bad idea. First, as an over-the-counter purchase, it effectively throws the entire burden of cost back onto the shoulders of women. Second, far too many women only see the doctor when they need their prescription refilled. Many younger, seemingly healthy women would skip this step. Doctors would lose the opportunity to monitor their patient, and potentially identify serious short- and long-term health risks. Third, when choosing a birth-control method, it’s important to understand HOW it works in your body. Oral contraceptives shut down the ovaries to prevent ovulation. No egg to meet up with sperm, no issue. Here’s the problem. Ovaries are not just about eggs. Their primary function is to manufacture hormones the body needs. Most OCPs are a combination of synthetic estrogen and progesterone to replace what the ovaries would normally produce. What they don’t replace is testosterone, which is 40 percent of a woman’s hormonal makeup and ovaries manufacture most of it.”

But while it's easy to tell if a job applicant is an 11-year-old, employers need E-Verify to tell if he's a legal worker.

The current US system of pharmaceutical company self-monitoring and Food and Drug Administration oversight is not working. Moreover, it cannot realistically be expected to work. A ban is needed to protect the public’s health and the quality of healthcare… DTC ads manipulate the patient’s agenda and steal precious time away from an evidence-based primary care clinician agenda that is attempting to promote healthy behavior, screen for early-stage treatable disease, and address mental health. …Discussing why the advertised drug is not the best option for a particular patient may mean that a mammogram is not ordered, an important health behavior is not discussed, a family matter is not brought up… The clinician is put in the role of gatekeeper for the advertised commodity rather than a gateway for prioritizing health care based on the concerns of patients and the science-based recommendations for preventative, chronic disease, mental health, and family care… Only a ban will work. The impossibility of regulating complex overt and covert multichannel messages with both rational and emotional appeals, the power imbalance between the public good and the commercial imperative, the difficulty of anticipating ads’ unintended consequences, and the availability of less-biased sources of information and motivation all argue for totally proscribing DTC ads.”

"""I'd love to imagine that voting systems are built and managed in some independent and honest vacuum, but this is the land of opportunity. Besides that, treating voting systems as non-partisan would require overlooking that fact that the technology is deeply mired in very partisan affairs. Walden O'Dell, the Diebold Inc. CEO, was an avid Bush benefactor and even ran fund-raisers at his mansion asking for $10K donations to benefit the Ohio Republican Party's federal campaign fund.   More to the point, these funds supported Blackwell, the Republican Secretary of State who just also happened to be in charge of selecting Diebold as the official voting machine. So after Diebold successfully lobbied Blackwell, Blackwell tried to use his sole control of $106 million in federal funds to force counties in Ohio to buy the Diebold voting systems against their wishes and without open vaildation of the new systems...

These American children may have to start over in a country with a new language, fewer resources and an uncertain future. America’s immigration laws force American children to lose their parent, or their country. Mandatory deportation is a life sentence of exile. Such a severe 'one size fits all' punishment cannot be the basis of our immigration system."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Instead of railing against the increasing exploitation of females internationally, mainstream American feminists have mostly chosen to ignore the severe and tragic harms of prostitution. Why the wall of silence regarding men’s legitimized sense of entitlement to demand sex anytime, any way they want it, from mostly minority and poverty-stricken women?...   Rejecting prostitution is consistent with the feminist belief that men do not have a right to control women’s sexuality ever, but too many feminist women still can't say so while standing tall and without apologizing for believing it."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Predictions of accelerating human-caused climate change are based upon computerized climate models that are inadequate and incorrect. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes. [58] A 2011 Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science study using observational data rather than computer climate models concluded that ""the models are exaggerating climate sensitivity"" and overestimate how fast the earth will warm as CO2 levels increase. [75] Two other studies using observational data found that IPCC projections of future global warming are too high. [76] [97] In a 2014 article, climatologist and former NASA scientist Roy Spencer, PhD, concluded that 95% of climate models have ""over-forecast the warming trend since 1979.""

10	Should the US Subsidize Alternative Energies?	"""These people in the wind energy business have made their fortunes because they are subsidized by you and me, and the Democrats passed a big energy bill late last year that jacked up taxes on the oil and gas industry by about $14 billion and then handed the money over to the wind energy folks and other industries. That's just dead wrong. We need to eliminate those subsidies. If they can't make it in the free market - particularly with oil at $130 plus - the alternative energy guys can certainly make money if it's a good idea."""

10	Should the US Immediately Phase out Fossil Fuels?	"""Scale is critical in our massive global energy system. The existing oil delivery system is highly efficient and economical, and the cost of rapidly replacing it with alternatives would be prohibitive. A prudent approach demands that we recognize that the massive scale of the global energy system makes rapid change costly and impractical...  While the push for alternatives is important, we must also be mindful that efforts to rapidly promote alternatives could have a 'chilling effect' on investment in the oil sector. Growing demand uncertainty increases producers' perceptions of investment risk. A nightmare scenario would be created if alternative energy supplies fail to meet overly optimistic expectations, while traditional energy suppliers scale back investment due to expectations of declining demand for their products. The prospects of supply constraints would grow along with the potential for higher energy prices and lower economic growth.  Meeting the needs of a growing global population and the aspirations of billions of people in developing countries for greater prosperity, will require an 'all of the above' energy strategy. All BTUs are welcome and needed - whether they come from renewable energy, nuclear power or fossil fuels."""

They believe that the text of this document supports the position that the United States was founded upon religious, if not Christian, principles, and therefore church and state must remain intertwined in order for this nation to continue properly.  There are a couple of flaws in this argument. For one thing, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document for this nation. What this means is that it has no authority over our laws, our lawmakers, or ourselves. It cannot be cited as precedent or as being binding in a courtroom. The purpose of the Declaration of Independence was to make a moral case for dissolving the legal ties between the colonies and Great Britain; once that goal was achieved, the official role of the Declaration was finished."""

That having been said, I am generally supportive of making insider trading illegal for members of Congress and their staffs. It is likely to have some positive effect. However, historically speaking, convicting an individual of insider trading has always been a difficult task... In my view, the vast majority of insider trading goes undetected as evidenced by the fact that corporate insiders continue to earn significant abnormal returns despite the best efforts of the SEC to monitor their trading activities. Thus I am doubtful that making insider trading by members of Congress illegal will eliminate the problem."""

"""I do want to state my view that the current prohibitions on insider trading under federal securities laws and rules, as worked out and applied by the courts through the ‘misappropriation theory’ of insider trading, do apply to members and staff of Congress. In other words, in my view, Members and staff of the House and Senate do not enjoy any blanket immunity from enforcement actions, whether civil or criminal, for violations of the prohibitions on insider trading; an enforcement action may be brought where a Member or employee of Congress uses – in connection with a securities trade – material, nonpublic information, to the source of which the Member or employee owes a duty of trust or confidence.”"

Look at production capability. It's totally inadequate for saying did they move small amounts, did they move technology, did they move documentation -- absolutely possible; I would say probable. But my personal belief is that they did not move large stockpiles, because I do not believe they had reconstituted a capability that had produced large stockpiles. So that's how you get at it...My belief that they did not move large stockpiles of WMD to Syria is based on my conclusion that there were not large stockpiles to move..."""
01	Should Bottled Water Be Banned? - Top 4 Pros and Cons	"Banning bottled water would protect local water supplies. Almost 64% of bottled water comes from municipal supplies.

[18][19] In Michigan, the state allowed Nestlé to pump and bottle clean water from the state's reserves while local residents in Flint fought for access to clean water. [24] In Pakistan, groundwater levels were depleted in a village neighboring a Nestlé bottled water production plant, resulting in the local water supply turning to sludge. [35]"
01	Is It Less Expensive to Conduct an Election Using Electronic Voting Machines Compared to Optical Scan Voting Systems?	"""DRE systems are considerably less expensive to operate. Optical scan systems require two different types of hardware for each election and require costly printed ballots. Both the upfront hardware costs and the long term recurring costs are less expensive with DRE equipment than they are with optical scan technology.  A DRE machine, used by all voters regardless of disability, would cost roughly $7,500 per Electoral District [New York State requires full-face DREs, which are more expensive than other types of DREs] while an optical scanner ($5000) and a separate accessible machine ($7500) would cost $12,500 per electoral district.   The purchase and operation of a DRE system over a ten year period would be less than half the cost of an optical scan system when accessibility equipment and recurring ballot printing costs are factored into county budgets."""
01	Should Felons Be Permitted to Vote while in Prison?	"'Americans may see it as common sense that you lose your right to vote when you're imprisoned, but in many democracies prisoners retain the right to vote. When that right is revoked, it's only for particular crimes (in Germany, it's for 'targeting' the 'democratic order'), and often there is a good deal of judicial discretion. Mandatory disenfranchisement is unusual, and permanent disenfranchisement is even rarer…   Prisoners are neither more nor less rational than anyone else who is allowed to vote.  If anything, the political system needs the perspectives of prisoners, with their intimate experience of this otherwise opaque part of the state. Their votes might force lawmakers to take a closer look at what happens in these institutions before they spiral into unaccountable violence and abuse.  There are practical benefits as well. Racial disparities in criminal enforcement and sentencing means disenfranchisement falls heaviest on black communities. This is not just a direct blow to prisoners' electoral power; it also ripples outward, depressing political participation among their friends, families and acquaintances. On the other end, suffrage in prison may help incarcerated people maintain valuable links to their communities, which might smooth the transition process once they're released."""

10	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	It is hypocritical for the US government to promote democracy by prohibiting Americans from traveling there. It is hypocritical to restrict American rights as a means of forcing another country to embrace freedom. It is also hypocritical to demand that Cuba adopt a representative democracy given the long history of US support for brutal dictatorships in countries that favor American interests, such as Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Augusto Pinochet in Chile. [72] The United States even backed Cuban dictator General Batista (who was overthrown by Fidel Castro), someone known to have killed, tortured, and imprisoned political dissenters, because he was friendly to American interests. [73] Furthermore, the US has a higher per capita incarceration rate than Cuba, about 716 prisoners per 100,000 people compared to an estimated 510 per 100,000 in Cuba, so concerns about the number of prisoners there is hypocritical.

10	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?	"""I am not a philosopher or an ethicist, but I know what is right and what is wrong. Condoning the murder of infants is wrong. Devaluing the life of a human because of her disability is discriminatory, hateful, and bigoted. Peter Singer can package his ideas as utilitarian, practical, ethical, logical, even reasonable if he chooses. The plain truth is that Peter Singer thinks people with disabilities have lives that aren't worth living...   Singer argues that disabled infants may be killed ethically because they are not sentient beings. Sentient or not, babies with disabilities grow up to be children and then adults with disabilities. As an adult, this same person will likely have a much different view of his quality of life than his parent might have had based on the doctor's predictions at the time of birth. Studies have shown that people with disabilities usually have a much higher perception of the quality of their lives than people without disabilities have for them…   Singer's core vision, that the life of a person with a disability is worth less than the life of a person without a disability, and therefore it is okay to kill infants with disabilities if that is what the parent wants to do, amounts to a defense of genocide. It is sad that just as Dr. Kevorkian has finally been recognized in a court of law as being a criminal for acting on the basis of similar beliefs in the case of physician assisted suicide, Princeton sees fit to hire a proponent of infanticide to teach ethics to undergraduates.   Parents of a newborn with a disability are often in a state of shock and adjustment for a long period after the baby is born. Once this phase is over, most parents come to value their child with a disability and to learn about the benefits the entire family can realize from the perspective this child brings them. Singer would like to give parents an easy out so they can go ahead and have another child to 'replace' the defective baby. What parents in that situation need is information and support so that they can give that child the best possible chance to develop into an independent adult. They don't need a nudge from their doctor or their insurance company to put the baby out of its misery (and save the insurance company a few hundred thousand dollars as part of the bargain)."""

This produces a high steady level of THC in the blood, which causes continual sedation. The brain is numbed. The mind is in a fog. … Their minds become so confused that many are caught in a life of drug abuse. It is difficult to escape, because regular pot smokers must quit pot for over a month before they can think clearly again. Since THC is continually in the body, the ‘high’ from pot gradually diminishes, and so pot smokers usually take other drugs to get a kick. Nevertheless, they continue to smoke pot as they use the other drugs, because they think pot makes them ‘feel good all the time.’ Most pot smokers drink alcohol heavily, and many become so confused that they take cocaine or heroin.”

The secret documents reveal beyond a shadow of a doubt that even the most generous offers of land and security by the Palestinians in a two-state paradigm were rejected by Israel. During these negotiations, and in fact during the last twenty years of serious discussion of a two-state solution, Israel has doubled and redoubled efforts to create facts on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza which render a two-state solution impossible to implement.  Quite simply, Israel has created the one state. This state gives 80% of its citizens (the Jewish population) full democratic and civil rights. 20% of the citizens (Palestinian citizens of Israel) experience institutionalized discrimination in virtually all sectors of civil and political life. The remaining population in the West Bank lives in an apartheid like system of separate and unequal rights under full military occupation by Israel.

01	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Let's take homicide as an example. The GAO estimates 'criminal aliens' were arrested, convicted and incarcerated for 25,064 homicides. If non-citizens committed them over seven years, the annual rate would be 14.2 per 100,000 non-citizens. If illegal aliens committed them over four years, the annual rate would be 58.0 per 100,000 illegal aliens. Either way you compute, those are high rates.   By comparison, the FBI reports the murder rates for the entire U.S. from 2003 through 2009 varied from 5.0 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants for an average rate of 5.5. To be clear, 5.5 is much lower than either 14.2 or 58.0.   Or look at the total number of homicides in those years. Per the FBI, there were 67,642 murders in the U.S. from 2005 through 2008, and 115,717 from 2003 through 2009. Per the GAO, criminal aliens committed 25,064 of them. That means they committed 22% to 37% of all murders in the U.S., while being only 3.52% to 8.25% of the population.   Conclusion: criminal and illegal aliens commit murder at much higher rates than all inhabitants of the U.S. – at least 3 to 10 times higher."""

For example, there was no way to tell from the brains LeVay studied whether the differences in brain structure were the cause or the effect of homosexual behavior.

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“The other illogical pro Prop.8 argument is that same-gender marriage threatens traditional, biblically based marriage. This may be the greatest red herring that is readily assumed as normative. There is no such thing as traditional, biblically based marriage – at least in the Western hemisphere. I know of no heterosexual couple living in the United States that has a marriage that is remotely similar to what is found within the Bible. Biblical marriage viewed women as property; based almost exclusively on procreation. Thus, those who wish to oppose same-gender marriage on a biblical basis must do so by advocating for their private view of morality as the best way for society, using a stagnant definition of marriage that never existed in a world that is constantly evolving… If Prop.8 passes, which means same-gender marriage is defeated, no one benefits. All this initiative would do is deny certain couples the right to marry for no other reason than their perceived failure to fit into the dominant paradigm as defined by the dominant culture. Prop.8 is illogical because it is narrowly defined as being about marriage, but ultimately it is about equal rights — a concept that all Californians should endorse. And we should stand in staunch opposition when there is an initiative on the ballot, like Prop.8, that seeks to take away one of our most fundamental privileges.”

In June 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court made quite clear that these actions are legally distinct. There is a constitutional right to refuse medical treatments and even have a proxy exercise that refusal, while, by a vote of 9 to 0, the Court clearly stated that there is no constitutional right for either euthanasia or PAS.

Kaepernick and others who have refused to stand for the national anthem have caused division among their teams, their fans, and across the country. The Santa Clara police union hinted they would boycott providing security at games after Kaepernick revealed his reasons for protesting the national anthem and wore socks depicting pigs in police uniforms. [14][15] Fans have been burning Kaepernick's jersey to show their distaste for his actions. One video of a jersey on fire posted on Facebook was captioned, ""He says he's oppressed making $126 million. Well, Colin, here's my salute to you."" [17]"

Therefore, cannabinoids may be considered for treatment of inflammatory disease.”
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	Returning to a gold standard would lower inflation rates and slow the rise in consumer prices. Historically, the United States has had lower levels of inflation when on a gold standard. From 1880-1913, under a gold standard, average inflation was 1.6% per year. [8] In 1971, when Nixon took the United States off the gold standard, inflation was at 3.3%. By 1979 it had risen to 13.3%. [10] In a study of 15 countries covering the years 1820-1994, Federal Reserve economists found the average annual inflation rate under a gold standard was 1.75%, versus 9.17% when not on a gold standard. [11] From 1971 to 2003 the dollar lost nearly 80% of its purchasing power due to inflation. [29] Between 1971 and 1980 the inflation rate rose from 4.4% to 13.5%. [10] By 2011, the dollar's purchasing power had been reduced to the point that it has the same purchasing power as 19 cents did in 1971. [30] Read More
01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“In all the work I have done as president, every decision I have made, every executive action I have taken, every bill I have proposed and signed, I’ve tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build the future of our dreams, in a good society, with a strong economy, a cleaner environment, and a freer, safer, more prosperous world. I have steered my course by our enduring values. Opportunity for all. Responsibility from all. A community of all Americans. I have sought to give America a new kind of government, smaller, more modern, more effective, full of ideas and policies appropriate to this new time, always putting people first, always focusing on the future… I’m very grateful to be able to turn over the reins of leadership to a new president, with America in such a strong position to meet the challenges of the future.”

The Palestinian Authority has no good health-care system or policing system in all of Judea and Samaria. The whole idea of establishing a Palestinian state here is not realistic at all. It cannot sustain itself, and many of the Palestinian residents would like to leave the area. Their lives are terrible. There's a lot of corruption here."""

10	Is Obesity a Disease?	Obesity is the result of sedentary lifestyles. Compared to 40 years ago, people today spend more time commuting, sitting in front of a computer, watching television, playing video games, and generally exercising less. [10] In 1960 50% of jobs required moderate physical activity compared to just 20% of jobs in 2011; the other 80% in 2011 required little or no physical activity. [18] This shift represents 120-140 fewer calories burned per day, which closely aligns with the nation's overall weight gain trends. [18] Men expended 142 fewer calories daily and weighed 32.8 pounds more in 2003-2006 than in 1960-1962, while women expended 124 fewer calories daily and weighed 25.13 pounds more in 2003-2006 than in 1960-1962.

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“[T]he truth is that the most common form of hormonal contraception—the pill—could be even more accessible if it became available over the counter (OTC) to all women. Whether someone needs birth control after office hours, over the weekend, while on vacation, or simply does not have the time or resources for a separate appointment, an OTC pill would offer accessibility and convenience for those unable or unwilling to visit a health care provider for a prescription. Access to contraception is grounded in international human rights and is critical to an individuals’ [sic] ability to control his or her own life and reproduction. Moreover, making the pill more accessible is an important public health goal because more than half of all pregnancies in the United States each year are unintended.”

01	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS) Encourage the Healthcare Industry to Promote PAS, Endangering Vulnerable Groups?	"""Physician-assisted suicide further damages the broader health care context by giving insurance providers perverse incentives to provide a 'cheap fix' for patients who require additional, more expensive care.  Physician-assisted suicide also leaves patients vulnerable to pressure to end their lives, not only from their doctor or insurance provider but from family members. Families have intergenerational responsibilities to look after the young, the sick, and the aged. But the normalization of physician-assisted suicide destroys these intergenerational ties by encouraging families to view the elderly or disabled as burdens, a view which patients may then internalize themselves."""
10	Do Poll Workers Have Sufficient Support Mechanisms to Deal with Unanticipated Technical Issues with Electronic Voting Machines on Election Day?	"""In addition to poll workers, county management also arranged for county personnel to staff the polling precincts to provide support. These positions were called Troubleshooters, Verification Specialists and Back-up Specialists.  Approximately 40 county employees served in the capacity of Troubleshooters... From what the OIG has learned during our inquiry, there just weren't enough of them.  County officials developed the position of Back-up Specialist...to offer professional level support to assist with start-up procedures and data back-up at each precinct on election day... While this was a valiant effort by the County Manager's Office, especially with the training assistance of the ERD [County Employee Relations Department], it was just too little too late."""
01	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""The next major economic revolution will be the clean energy revolution. A cap-and-trade system that drives American investment and inspires American innovation will position the United States competitively for growth in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. The choice facing us is a stark one: Will we develop and export the coming wave of low carbon technologies — like carbon capture and sequestration, next-generation solar panels, and powerful lightweight batteries — so that jobs and businesses stay in America? Or, will we do nothing and find ourselves importing these technologies from overseas? Failure to act on a cap-and-trade policy would withhold the signals and incentives that can empower the American economy to modernize jobs, services and technologies, and allow the country to emerge from this next phase of global change and competition in the leadership position it holds today.  Now — when our economy is in a deep recession — is precisely the time when bold action is needed most. If climate legislation is passed during this Congress and takes effect in 2012, the impact on energy prices will be zero this year; zero in 2010; zero in 2011. On the other hand, passage of legislation will help to unleash a flood of investment, by sending a clear signal of what the price of carbon will be. Electric utilities and manufacturing companies are waiting for legislation before they invest in new power plants or factories that will last forty years or more. A cap on carbon will drive investment right away...  A cap on carbon will not create money out of thin air. But it will unleash capital that is sitting on the sidelines, and channel it towards clean-energy investments that will revitalize our economy while ensuring a prosperous future."""

01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“[T]he American Medical Women’s Association has adopted the position that the decision to continue or interrupt a pregnancy belongs to the pregnant woman, in consultation with her physician. Pregnancy is a major medical event in the life of a woman, a condition that involves medical risk for a patient, ranging from minor physical inconveniences to death itself. In the United States, 49% of the 6.3 million pregnancies a year are unintended. A pregnancy that is unintended or unwanted carries a greater medical risk for the woman because neglected prenatal care results in higher rates of pregnancy-related disease and death. A pregnant woman’s decision to complete or terminate a pregnancy is a medical issue to be made in the privacy of the doctor-patient relationship… Abortions will be chosen whether they are legal or illegal. When abortion was illegal in this country, it was brought about by dangerous, self-induced methods or by clandestine, often untrained, practitioners under unsterile conditions with no follow-up care. Many women suffered reproductive tract damage, infection, bleeding, permanent sterility, or death. Since the advent of legal abortion in the United States, there has been a marked decrease in all pregnancy-related deaths and an even greater drop in pregnancy and abortion-related complications…”

01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Since the [1998] publication of the ICNIRP ‘Guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields (up to 300 GHz)’ many scientific studies of the effects of such fields have been published… For [Radio] frequencies above 100 kHz, including frequencies used for modern wireless communications, several major national and international research programs have been completed recently… [I]t is the opinion of ICNIRP that the scientific literature published since the 1998 guidelines has provided no evidence of any adverse effects below the basic restrictions and does not necessitate an immediate revision of its guidance on limiting exposure to high frequency electromagnetic fields… With regard to non-thermal interactions, it is in principle impossible to disprove their possible existence but the plausibility of the various non-thermal mechanisms that have been proposed is very low. In addition, the recent in vitro and animal genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are rather consistent overall and indicate that such effects are unlikely at low levels of exposure… Many epidemiological studies initiated recently have focused primarily on possible biological and adverse health conditions that might be associated with the operation of modern telecommunication systems. The Interphone Study, a multi-country coordinated casecontrol study, addresses possible cancer risks due to the relatively high local exposure of the user’s head when using mobile phones. The pooled analysis of all national data is not yet published. However, individual national and multinational results published thus far do not indicate an elevation of the risk of cancers in the head with cell phones within 10 years of first use.”
01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“Given the [Social Security] program’s looming financial crisis, benefit cutbacks are increasingly likely. Therefore, the entirely political nature of Social Security places workers’ retirement security at considerable risk. Indeed, Congress has already arbitrarily reduced Social Security benefits of some groups of workers. Moreover, because Social Security benefits are not a worker’s property, they are not inheritable. In contrast, a privatized Social Security system, based on individual accounts, would provide workers with the benefits and the safeguards of true ownership.”
10	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“Another out-of-date policy from the Cold War is the trade embargo on Cuba. The world has changed, and it is long past time that we change our policies with Cuba… It does not make our country safer and it does no good to the people of Cuba… That regime has survived 50 years of sanctions. Old age and ill health will end their rule rather than the embargo. A better approach is building relationships between the people and businesses here and the people and businesses in Cuba. This doesn’t mean we stop advocating for human rights. We should be able to balance these goals as we did in our approach with China and based on vote today on Russia.”
10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	Social media facilitates cyberbullying. 52% of students have reported being the victim of cyberbullying with 84.2% naming Facebook as the site through which they have been bullied, followed by Instagram (23.4%), Twitter (21.4%), and Snapchat (13.5%). [259] 17.5% of male students and 21.3% of female students have admitted committing bullying behavior online.

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Animals are used in research when there is a need to find out what happens in the whole, living body, which is far more complex than the sum of its parts. It is difficult, and in most cases simply not yet possible, to replace the use of living animals in research with alternative methods… Humans and animals share hundreds of illnesses, and consequently animals can act as models for the study of human illness. For example, rabbits suffer from atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), as well as diseases such as emphysema, and birth defects such as spina bifida. Dogs suffer from cancer, diabetes, cataracts, ulcers and bleeding disorders such as haemophilia, which make them natural candidates for research into these disorders. Cats suffer from some of the same visual impairments as humans… New medicines require testing because researchers must measure both the beneficial and the harmful effects of a compound on a whole organism. A medicine is initially tested in vitro using tissues and isolated organs, but legally and ethically it must also be tested in a suitable animal model before clinical trials in humans can take place.”

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?	"""No system of justice can produce results which are 100% certain all the time. Mistakes will be made in any system which relies upon human testimony for proof. We should be vigilant to uncover and avoid such mistakes. Our system of justice rightfully demands a higher standard for death penalty cases. However, the risk of making a mistake with the extraordinary due process applied in death penalty cases is very small, and there is no credible evidence to show that any innocent persons have been executed at least since the death penalty was reactivated in 1976.   The 100+ death row inmates 'innocent', 'exonerated' and released, as trumpeted by anti-death penalty activists, is a fraud. The actual number of factually innocent released death row inmates in closer to 40, and in any event should be considered in context of over 7,000 death sentences handed down since 1973. It stands as the most accurate judgment/sentence in any system of justice ever created. The inevitability of a mistake should not serve as grounds to eliminate the death penalty any more than the risk of having a fatal wreck should make automobiles illegal."""

01	Is a Physician ever Obligated to Help a Patient Die?	"""It would be hard for me to construct addressing the suffering of a terminally ill patient as a harm. It is an obligation. The question is, how we can respond to those kinds of sufferings? Part of our job, in my opinion, is to help people die better. I say that in a direct way because it irks me when we say that doctors should not help people die. We need people who are committed to caring for people all the way through to their death as if they were family members, committed to relieving their suffering. Sometimes that requires helping people to die. It is not a happy day when we are taking people off life support. We do not like to do it. Sometimes we dream about it afterward. But we do it because we have to do it, because the patient is saying that they do not want it anymore. They have had it. We understand. We all talk about it. We make sense of it.

01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	"Private accounts would allow benefits to be inherited. The present system is inequitable because people who live shorter lives collect less of their earned benefits and yet those benefits cannot be transferred to family members.

Bush stated in his 2005 State of the Union speech, ""you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children or grandchildren.""

10	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""Miners, workers, and residents in the vicinity of the mining and milling functions, and workers involved in the enrichment processes necessary to create nuclear fuel are at risk for exposure to unhealthy amounts of radiation and have increased incidences of cancer and related diseases as a result...  Relatively small but significant amounts of radiation are released on a daily basis into the air and water during the course of mining, milling, and enriching uranium for fuel to create the nuclear energy. Additionally, a nuclear power plant cannot operate without routinely releasing radioactivity into the air and water through the normal operation of nuclear reactors. Finally, and most frighteningly, accidental releases of even more radiation are commonplace in the nuclear industry...  Radioactive gases that leak from fuel rods are also routinely released or 'vented' into the atmosphere at every nuclear reactor. These gases are temporarily stored to allow the short-lived isotopes to decay and then released to the atmosphere through engineered holes in the reactor roof and from the steam generators. This process is called 'venting.' About 100 cubic feet of radioactive gases are also released hourly from the condensers at the reactor...  Although the nuclear industry claims it is 'emission' free, in fact it is collectively releasing millions of curies [the standard unit of radioactivity measurement] annually... By contrast, coal plants release some uranium and uranium daughter products in their smoke but very little radiation compared to atomic plants, and certainly no fission products...  Quite apart from these routine radioactive releases is the almighty problem of radioactive waste. Each regular 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plant generates 30 tons of extremely potent radioactive waste annually... the nuclear industry has yet to determine how safely to dispose of this deadly material, which remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years."""
10	Is Nuclear Power Cost-Effective?	"""Nuclear is incredibly expensive. The costs have just stood up on end lately. Wall Street Journal recently reported that they're about two to four times the cost that the industry was talking about just a year ago...  2006, the last full year of data we have, nuclear worldwide added a little bit of capacity, more than all of it from upgrading old plants, because the new ones they built were smaller than the retirements of old plants. So they added 1.4 billion watts. Sounds like a lot. Well, it's about one big plant's worth worldwide. That was less than photovoltaics, solar cells added in capacity. It was a tenth what wind power added. It was a thirtieth to a fortieth of what micropower added...  [R]enewables, other than big hydro, got last year $71 billion of private capital; nuclear, as usual, got zero.  [Y]ou will find major environmental groups saying something like 'explore' or 'consider' [expanded nuclear power], but they will also say very carefully it has to be competitive, it has to be cost-effective. And clearly, that doesn't even pass the giggle test."""
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	People should pay for their own health care, not have it given to them by the government. Under a single-payer system, the right to health care is paid for through taxes, and people who work hard and pay those taxes are forced to subsidize health care for those who are not employed.

There is no drug that can or should be smoked, but when we get to potential components of marijuana that might have medicinal benefits, then let’s find out what that is. Most of our medicines have come from plants. They’re plant-based, but they’ve gone through that rigorous process. Because, let’s face it, any medicine is a toxin.

01	Mandatory National Service - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Mandatory national service would foster unity and bring people from diverse backgrounds together. The partisan divide in the United States has never been greater: Pew Research tracked an increase in partisan differences from 15 percentage points in 1994 to 36 points in 2017. [4] Dan Glickman, JD, former US congressman from Kansas, believes that mandatory service would be a solution to our ""current dysfunction"" because ""National service, be it in the military, Peace Corps, or other public or private sector opportunities, breaks down the barriers of race, class, income, geography, and even language. Young adults are granted the opportunity to see their peers and fellow Americans as a member of their team."" [5] Around 30 countries have compulsory military service. [6] Switzerland, which has four official languages and three major ethnic groups, bridges its divides with a mandatory national service program. The European nation is identified as one of the happiest countries in the world by the United Nations. [7] Gene Yaw, JD, state senator in Pennsylvania, recommends a two-year universal public service requirement to promote civility and understanding of what it means to be an American: ""We cannot generate enthusiasm for our way of life when less than 2% of our population has put forth any effort for our country.""

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Prostitution should not be a crime. Prostitutes are not committing an inherently harmful act. While the spread of disease and other detriments are possible in the practice of prostitution, criminalization is a sure way of exacerbating rather than addressing such effects. We saw this quite clearly in the time of alcohol prohibition in this country...   I would like the government to decriminalize prostitution but to regulate it in the way that other intimate service professions (such as massage therapists and doctors) are regulated on the basis of hygiene-related concerns.   One thing I would add is that there is a double-standard that permeates the enforcement of laws against prostitution. The prostitutes are harassed, arrested, and sometimes prosecuted, while the johns (and often the pimps, who are far more likely to be engaged in violent and master/slave-like treatment of the prostitutes) are ignored. This reflects the view that men who traffic in women are not as bad as the women in whom they traffic. If people are honestly concerned about the wellbeing of women in this profession, then they must begin by removing the status of 'outlaw' from these women so that they can come forward and receive help if and when they feel they want to leave a profession that can otherwise be quite difficult to escape."""

In a time where traveling for work has become the norm and so many people are required to be in a different place multiple times each month, social media allows individuals the chance to stay close with their family and friends. It allows them to share what’s going on in their life in the most convenient way… Social media accounts enable people from all over the world to foster and maintain relationships without letting distance become a barrier. Social media has also created an exciting outlet for people to see news and stay updated on current events in the world… [S]ocial media has given our society a better way of life and it has aided people in their daily lives. Social media is not the enemy; it is our ally and it has provides us with resources that we never knew before.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Ethanol is a net energy loss - it takes 70 percent more energy to produce than is obtained from the product itself. Other biomass resources show, at best, very low net energy recovery...  The two most popularly suggested energy alternatives, wind and solar, suffer because they're undependable, intermittent sources of energy, and the end product is electricity. We have no way to store large amounts of electricity for use when wind and sunshine are not with us. Geothermal and tidal energy are insignificant energy sources in total but can be locally important. Nuclear energy can be a large power source if the safety aspects can be guaranteed (and this may be possible) -- but again, the end product is electricity. There is no battery pack even remotely in sight that would supply the energy needed to effectively power bulldozers, heavy agricultural equipment such as tractors and combines, or 18-wheelers hauling freight cross-country.  Can electricity be used to obtain hydrogen as a fuel from water? It can, but hydrogen is difficult to store and dangerous to handle. And there is no energy system now visualized to replace kerosene jet fuel, which propels a Boeing 747 about 600 miles an hour nonstop on the 14-hour trip from New York to Capetown (currently the longest plane flight). We continue to seek the holy grail of energy - fusion - but containing the heat of the sun at 10 million degrees Centigrade is still only a far-off hope."""

10	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Glaucoma?	smoked marijuana reduces intraocular pressure, its clinical utility in glaucoma is compromised by its short duration of action and accompanying central side effects. Furthermore, the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and CNS [central nervous system] effects of marijuana are of great concern given that glaucoma is a chronic illness and a large number of patients are elderly. Additionally, the ability of marijuana or THC to protect the optic nerve has not been studied… Neither smoked marijuana nor THC is a viable approach in the treatment of glaucoma, but research on their mechanism of action may be important in developing new agents that act in an additive or synergistic manner with currently available therapies.”
01	Does Obamacare Cover People with Pre-Existing Conditions? - YES	"""Under the Affordable Care Act, health plans cannot limit or deny benefits or deny coverage for a child younger than age 19 simply because the child has a 'pre-existing condition' — that is, a health problem that developed before the child applied to join the plan.  Until now, plans could refuse to accept anyone because of a pre-existing health condition, or they could limit benefits for that condition.  Now, under the health care law, plans that cover children can no longer exclude, limit, or deny coverage to your child under age 19 solely based on a health problem or disability that your child developed before you applied for coverage.  This rule applies to all job-related health plans as well as individual health insurance policies issued after March 23, 2010. The rule will affect your plan as soon as it begins a plan year or policy year on or after September 23, 2010."""

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“The Royal Society of Biology supports the use of animals in research when properly regulated and when no alternatives are available. We actively support progress towards a reduction in the use of animals by refining experiments and developing new ways to minimise the use of and replace animals wherever possible – often referred to as the 3Rs. Research using animals has directly contributed to medical and veterinary benefits including development of vaccines, antibiotics, and pioneering medical procedures that save and improve the quality of many human and animal lives. It has played a vital role in the major medical advances of the past century. It will continue to be necessary for some time as we search for treatments for life-threatening conditions such as cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, AIDS, trauma and many severe infectious and inherited diseases… [T]here are groups and individuals that wish to stop animal research completely, claiming that it is unnecessary and brings no benefit.

01	Are Children Who Are Raised by Gay Parents More Likely to Be Gay Themselves?	sexual orientation of parents appears to have a unique (although not large) effect on children in the politically sensitive domain of sexuality. The evidence, while scanty and underanalyzed, hints that parental sexual orientation is positively associated with the possibility that children will be more likely to attain a similar orientation – and theory and common sense also support such a view. Children raised by lesbian co-parents should and do seem to grow up more open to homoerotic relationships. This may be partly due to genetic and family socialization processes, but what sociologists refer to as ‘contextual effects’ not yet investigated by psychologists may also be important… We recognize the political dangers of pointing out that recent studies indicate that a higher proportion of children with lesbigay [lesbian and gay] parents are themselves apt to engage in homosexual activity. In a homophobic world, anti-gay forces deploy such results to deny parents custody of their children and to fuel backlash movements opposed to gay rights. Nonetheless, we believe that denying this probability capitulates to heterosexist ideology and is apt to prove counterproductive in the long run. It is neither intellectually honest nor politically wise to base a claim for justice on grounds that may prove falsifiable empirically.”

01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“Declaring the embargo a failure and using it as justification to reopen trade and relations ignores the fact that the Cuban economy is on its knees. The paltry changes we’ve seen (allowing Cubans to buy and sell some goods) have been necessitated by their economic crisis. Ending the embargo now not only ignores the atrocities perpetrated by the Castro regime, it also hands the Cuban government a huge financial boost at the exact moment they need and want it most. Friendship and an economic relationship with our nation must be earned, and Cubans deserve the freedom, democracy and human rights they lack. Until Cuba has demonstrated meaningful progress, unilateral changes in American policy would undeniably reward horrific behavior.”

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“The Earth’s climate is changing. In most places, average temperatures are rising… The most rapid warming has occured in recent decades. Most of this recent warming is very likely the result of human activities. Many human activities release ‘greenhouse gases’ into the atmosphere. The levels of these gases are increasing at a faster rate than at any time in hundreds of thousands of years. We know that greenhouse gases trap heat. If human activities continue to release greenhouse gases at or above the current rate, we will continue to increase average temperatures around the globe. Increases in global temperatures will most likely change our planet’s climate in ways that will have significant long-term effects on people and the environment… Within the past 30 years, the rate of warming across the globe has been approximately three times greater than the rate over the last 100 years. Past climate information suggests the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years in the Northern Hemisphere… If humans continue to emit greenhouse gases at or above the current pace, we will probably see an average global temperature increase of 3 to 7°F by 2100, and greater warming after that.”
10	Has Obamacare Worsened the Primary Care Physician Shortage? - DEBATED	"""While for much of the last 30 years interest in primary care among medical school graduates has steadily declined, that trend has recently abated.

In 2013, primary care residencies gained 1,502 more residency positions than in 2012 with a total of 11,762 applicants matched to primary care residencies...   The ACA included only modest provisions to increase physician supply... but did provide for redistribution of unused Medicare-funded residency slots to facilities that agree to train more primary care physicians, potentially increasing the number of primary care doctors entering the workforce by several hundred per year.   The ACA also raised Medicare reimbursement for many primary care physicians who have seen their incomes rise in recent years... Emerging delivery models promoted by the ACA, including the patient centered medical home, will allow primary care physicians to further boost their incomes by coordinating care, [and] implementing preventive care...  [I]ncreased medical graduate interest in primary care does indicate where the healthcare system is headed and underscores the relative rise in importance and influence of primary care doctors, who are the targets of aggressive recruiting across the country and are in greater demand than any other type of physicians."""
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“The AAF supports the right of pharmaceutical companies to advertise prescription drugs directly to consumers, provided all claims are substantiated and appropriate disclosures are included in the advertising. Proposed moratoriums on pharmaceutical advertising would violate the First Amendment protection for commercial speech. Barring information from advertising will cause more harm to consumers who are not encouraged by an ad to see a doctor about an illness. Surveys show that these ads prompted more than 39 million to ask their doctor about a particular health condition. Advertising is an important source of information about pharmaceuticals.”
10	Police Body Cameras: Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Police body cameras invade the privacy of citizens, expose victims and witnesses of crimes, and damage police-public relationships.

01	"Is it Valid to Look to the Intent of the Founding Fathers in Determining Whether the Words ""under God"" Should Remain in the Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""An understanding of the original intent of the founding fathers with respect to the role of religion in America is a 'necessary first step in reading the religion clauses of the Constitution.' The founding fathers were closer to the problem of religious despotism, having seen its effects in Europe and in the colonies. Their aspirations to provide guarantees for religious liberty in a constitutional government are instructive for a contemporary America that retains those aspirations. Thus, it is exceedingly important to consider the intentions of the framers who, so significantly, began the First Amendment with provisions concerning religion."""
01	Does Drinking Milk Contribute to Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD)?	"""[A] study was done at the Hospital for Sick Children in London and published in the leading British journal, Lancet, which demonstrated that most children with severe ADHD are salicylate [plant-based hormone] sensitive, but that 90 percent of these children have additional food intolerances... After determining that 80 percent of the children had apparent food sensitivities as a cause of hyper activity, they then performed double blind, placebo controlled challenges with the offending foods. Using this most rigorous clinical research method, the investigators confirmed the presence of food intolerance in the majority of children with ADHD. Subsequent research by the leading investigator of this study suggested that these food intolerances represent true food allergy. The foods to which children with ADHD most commonly had allergic reactions were cow's milk (which included milk, cheese, yogurt and ice cream), corn (an additive in many prepared foods), wheat, soy, and eggs... In my clinical practice I have found that food allergy is especially likely to be implicated in ADHD."""

01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“It’s time to eliminate from schools the status and respect many students give to clothing labels and price tags. Student attention needs to return to learning in the classroom, rather than how they look when they are in that classroom. Mandated uniforms can serve to shift the emphasis from competition back to academic performance and personal achievement… Uniforms create a feeling of oneness and belonging. Everyone can be on the same team. As on athletic teams, uniforms are worn for immediate identification and to inspire a feeling of ‘oneness.’ Put on your team uniform and you suddenly belong. A sense of loyalty emerges from inside, as does an extra effort to perform at the student’s best… Uniforms add measures of safety in identical dress. Gang identification is obscured. Group violence and theft are dissipated… Children are no longer identified by their ‘colors.’ Uniform dress alleviated the feelings of imminent danger for students who were afraid they might inadvertently dress in gang colors… Uniforms also raise students’ expectations of themselves. When dressed neatly and seriously, students tend to behave seriously. Often teachers find calmer, more polite, more attentive students. Students seem to feel more confident in the way they look, and so they have more confidence in themselves…”
10	Should the United States Continue to Build a Fence or Wall along the US/Mexico Border?	"""If this border wall actually happens, it will be an environmental catastrophe. Essentially, what it's doing is cutting through nature's bridge, which connects Central America to North America and South America. Wildlife have been using this natural corridor for millions of years. And, essentially, what this administration wants to do is put a twelve-hundred mile long barrier right through it. Think of all the different species and creatures that migrate for resources, for reproduction, for seasonality. Many of the animals that live in North America, evolved in South America and migrated along this natural causeway. So, it would be absolutely devastating. There are over a hundred bird species that migrate that will be critically impacted by this. And there are nearly 90 endangered and threatened species [including jaguars, ocelots, and the Mexican gray wolf], some of which could very well be pushed to extinction because of this proposed wall."""
10	Should the US Increase Its Use of Natural Gas?	"""Gas is hard to move except by pipeline. That means getting it from Canada, since Mexico is now a net gas importer (and likely to remain so till 2019, according to the DOE). The trouble is that Canadian production is also declining. That leaves only the hard way: shipping LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) mainly, from Trinidad at them moment, and soon from Africa and beyond, which is a costly and complex operation, for which the US presently has woefully insufficient infrastructure. What is more, these distant sources are subject to depletion too, and not a few political instabilities...   [M]ore drilling, allied with free market deregulation and greed, will get America still further into a black hole, from which it looks decreasingly likely that it can escape. A stark assessment of US gas reserves may help the American, and indeed Canadian, public to understand that both the long and short term solutions involve using less energy all round, with the focus being on using less natural gas and oil."""
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“Making birth-control pills available over the counter would greatly increase convenience and access for many women, ultimately leading to fewer unintended pregnancies. There is no reason women should have to obtain a prescription for this common, safe and effective drug that has been around since the 1960s… Because birth control is a prescription drug, and because the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to provide no-copay coverage for birth control, American women typically don’t buy the inexpensive pills directly from a pharmacy — as women do in most other countries. American women typically use a third-party payer, like an insurance company, to pay for their contraception. And often, employers provide health insurance… This pipeline of payment — among women, their employers, their insurers and ultimately their pharmacies — is inefficient and costly. Women may see no-copay birth control as a benefit, but it’s one they pay for: Since the Affordable Care Act passed, average health insurance premiums have increased by 105 percent, more than doubling. Women still pay for birth control; now we simply do it through higher insurance premiums… And ironically, the morning-after pill or ‘Plan B’ — which includes a much higher dose of the same hormones as regular birth-control pills — is available without a prescription. It makes no sense from public health standpoint that ‘Plan A’ is harder to get.”
10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“[I]f we selectively confer benefits on religion… we are doing as much harm to equality as if we disfavor some or all religions. If churches receive exemptions from taxes or zoning laws along with other socially desirable enterprises – say schools and community centers – that’s fine. But it is unjust to make churches the sole beneficiaries of such exemptions.”
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“The results, overall, have been fairly consistent across types of studies (experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal) and across visual media type (television, films, video games). There is a significant relation between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior. Exposing children and adolescents (or ‘youth’) to violent visual media increases the likelihood that they will engage in physical aggression against another person. By ‘physical aggression’ we mean behavior that is intended to harm another person physically, such as hitting with a fist or some object. A single brief exposure to violent media can increase aggression in the immediate situation. Repeated exposure leads to general increases in aggressiveness over time. This relation between media violence and aggressive behavior is causal.”
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“I’m a lifelong liberal, but after thirty years practicing psychiatry, much of it with children and adolescents, I’m totally against legalizing marijuana. And it’s not just me. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and American Academy of Pediatrics also staunchly oppose legalization. Why? Because just like Big Tobacco, a legal marijuana industry would target teenagers. With both tobacco and marijuana, 90% of adult users start as teens. All the profit in both industries depends on adolescent use. Big Tobacco used Joe Camel to get teenagers started. Big Marijuana is even worse. In Colorado, they entice kids with marijuana candies, cookies and soda. Denver pot stores aren’t filled with green leafy weed; they’re filled with THC infused gummy bear, lollipops, and sweetened products called Reefer’s peanut butter cups, Hashey’s chocolate and Pot-tarts. Google them. As a result, Colorado now has the country’s highest rate of teenage marijuana use, and the number of dogs and toddlers overdosing on pot has skyrocketed. The pot industry is directly targeting kids, even though hundreds of scientific studies show that marijuana – especially today’s high-potency weed – permanently damages the teenage brain. Teens who smoke pot regularly drop out at twice the rate of non-users, and as adults they earn less and have lower IQ. No parent wants this for their kids. But does the marijuana industry care? No more than Big Tobacco cares about cancer and heart disease; it’s just part of doing business. Remember: this initiative wasn’t written by hippies who want to get high; it was written by businessmen who want to make money getting your kids started on drugs. That’s why doctors who work with children – pediatricians and child psychiatrists – adamantly oppose this measure. As should we all.”

We know it’s the active approaches that work best in the treatment of chronic pain: understanding how pain works, getting regular cardiovascular exercise, practicing good sleep hygiene, setting goals, cognitive behavioral therapy, establishing a plan, etc. Trying to foster these practices through the haze of marijuana seems challenging at best, nonsensical at worst… The new face of marijuana is not Cheech and Chong. It is executives in three-piece suits looking to make a fortune at the expense of the brain cells of our youth, people in pain, and an unsuspecting nation.”

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The U.S. Government adopted a strong position against legalized prostitution in a December 2002 National Security Presidential Directive based on evidence that prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and fuels trafficking in persons, a form of modern-day slavery. Prostitution and related activities—including pimping and patronizing or maintaining brothels—fuel the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate.   Where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery...  Few activities are as brutal and damaging to people as prostitution. Field research in nine countries concluded that 60-75 percent of women in prostitution were raped, 70-95 percent were physically assaulted, and 68 percent met the criteria for post traumatic stress disorder in the same range as treatment-seeking combat veterans and victims of state-organized torture. Beyond this shocking abuse, the public health implications of prostitution are devastating and include a myriad of serious and fatal diseases, including HIV/AIDS...  State attempts to regulate prostitution by introducing medical check-ups or licenses don’t address the core problem: the routine abuse and violence that form the prostitution experience and brutally victimize those caught in its netherworld. Prostitution leaves women and children physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually devastated. Recovery takes years, even decades—often, the damage can never be undone."""
10	Is Marinol Better Medicine Than Marijuana?	we look at the pharmaecopia, when taken by mouth, delta-9 THC [Marinol] has a very low 6 to 20 percent absorption, and it’s very variable from one person to another…. Smoking THC, the THC is rapidly absorbed into the blood stream and redistributed with a considerable amount of it destroyed by combustion. Peak plasma levels are achieved at the very end of smoking and decline rapidly over 30 minutes, as if it were given intravenously, whereas, if taken by mouth, it’s a slow and doesn’t reach very high peaks and takes a long time to disappear. The amount of THC one is exposed to might be the same, but certainly the effects are much different. In patients who say, ‘I can control the onset and the duration much easier if I smoke than if I swallow it’ are telling us just what we know from the pharmaecopia.”
10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“Social Security is a successful intergenerational program that has served this country well… Privatization is not a plan to save Social Security; it is a plan to dismantle Social Security. Privatization means increased retirement risks, severe cuts in Social Security benefits, and a multi-trillion dollar increase in the federal debt… Right now, Social Security provides a guaranteed income, paying benefits every month for life, with increases for inflation. After adjusting for risk, Social Security has a rate of return equal to that of any mix of financial assets in private accounts. And risk must be taken into account, because stock market returns are never guaranteed! As we’ve seen in recent years, returns can fluctuate wildly… With privatization, some might do well, many might lose – but our society would lose the benefit of the sound, basic income security provided by Social Security retirement, disability and survivor benefits… Privatization is NOT the Answer!”

The last authoritative study showed that E-Verify flubbed this mission at least half the time, failing to identify anywhere from 37 percent to 64 percent of unauthorized workers.  If E-Verify were a commercial product, in short, no rational employer would pay to use it. It fails to identify illegal workers, and it turns away thousands of legal workers each year."""

It is often not obvious how to undo a selection, how to check that all races have been voted, how to distinguish between the offices, and how to register the votes. Some interfaces are 'too responsive': a voter can push a button for the next page and more than one page will pass by without the voter seeing it...

01	Would Improving Palliative Care Decrease Patient Requests for Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Most often, the request for euthanasia or assisted suicide is a plea for help in dealing with suffering as much as pain... The combined and integrated relief of pain and suffering shaped to suit the peculiarities of their manifestation in each person is the aim of comprehensive palliative care and the more sophisticated hospice regimens. Patients treated this way usually do not ask for termination of their lives; when they do ask for it, they tend to change their minds later. It is an injustice to offer these patients assisted suicide or euthanasia as options when so much more can be offered in the way of sophisticated treatment."""
01	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""With the increasing emphasis placed on health care providers to contain costs, euthanasia could certainly become a means of cost containment.   In the U.S., thousands of people have no medical insurance; studies have shown that the poor and minorities are not given access to available pain control, and managed-care facilities are offering physicians cash bonuses if they don’t provide care for patients.  With greater and greater emphasis being placed on managed care, many doctors are at financial risk when they provide treatment for their patients.  Legalized euthanasia raises the potential for a profoundly dangerous situation in which doctors could find themselves far better off financially if a seriously ill or disabled person 'chooses' to die rather than receive long-term care.  Savings to the government may also become a consideration. This could take place if governments cut back on paying for treatment and care and replace them with the 'treatment' of death."""

10	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""Capturing CO2 from existing power stations requires the use of expensive equipment and large quantities of energy, thus reducing overall power station efficiency...  Geosequestration offers the possibility of capturing and storing 80-90% of CO2 emitted from new coal-fired power stations in the long term. However, it would not reduce significantly any of the other environmental, health or social impacts of coal-fired electricity... namely air and water pollution, high water use, land degradation, occupation health and safety hazards...  [I]n countries that have placed strong emphasis on geosequestration in their energy policies, plans for new, conventional, dirty, coal-fired power stations are proceeding apace. In the USA about 100 such power stations are in various stages of development. Assuming that 72 of these projects survive public opposition, the USA would emit an additional 209-275 million tonnes of CO2 per year from coal by 2012...  This situation suggests that that the possibility of large-scale geosequestration, three or more decades in the future, is being used to deflect attention away from the current reality of business-as-usual. Thus, geosequestration is less about sustainable development and more about sustaining the coal industry by greening its image...  [T]he possibility of geosequestration in the future is being used to divert funding away from cleaner technologies that are more cost effective now, notably efficient energy use and renewable energy, and to deflect attention away from current proposals to build many more conventional dirty coal-fired power stations...

Personally I think the idea is brilliant and long overdue, especially for the apparent bloodthirsty American market which flock to Ultimate Fighting PPV broadcasts and other extreme events. Many viewers still think that professional wrestling is real. Perhaps they should be exposed to something that is real.  The drawback (or benefit, depending on your perspective) to this idea is having to listen to people moan-and-groan if such a plan comes to pass. Public executions are nothing new.

Many Americans do not realize the significant waiting times foreign visitors and business travelers experience to obtain a visa to enter the United States...  Those who 'play by the rules' are likely to wait many years to become a lawful permanent resident, whether they are sponsored by an employer or a family member. Waits for green cards (permanent residence) in the Skilled Workers and Professionals category have worsened considerably in the past few years, with the current wait for a newly sponsored high skill immigrant in this category exceeding 5 years...  Siblings of U.S. citizens can expect to wait 11 to 12 years from today before immigrating to America (22 years from the Philippines). Unmarried adult children can anticipate waiting 6 years, but 13 years if from Mexico and 14 years from the Philippines.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Executions should be banned by act of Congress for this simple reason: Experience has shown that the death penalty doesn't serve the cause of justice… How likely is it, really, that a killer will be more deterred by the risk of the death penalty than by having to spend the rest of his life in prison? The claim fails the test of common sense. Criminologists and police chiefs say the death penalty just doesn't influence murderers -- partly because its application is so haphazard… It's true that the purpose of punishment is not only deterrence but also retribution. But this doesn't justify the popular view that killers should be killed, any more than it would support the idea that rapists should be raped or thieves stolen from. To be just, retribution must be measured and restrained. That's the difference between justice and revenge…   The extraordinary crimes that would justify the death penalty are difficult to imagine, much less define, before the fact. And, even in exceptional cases, the requirement to prove guilt beyond any doubt is hard to satisfy. (What does ‘beyond any doubt’ actually mean? Is a psychopath guilty beyond any doubt?) Let's allow that it would have been right to execute Hitler. But let's also recognize that restricting the death penalty to the few cases where it would be both just and safe is impractical.

And hyperbolic stories about 'birth tourism' point to small numbers of foreigners who come to the U.S. legally to give birth to their children.   Further, repealing birthright citizenship would be incredibly unwise and unworkable, affecting everyone—not just immigrants. If birthright citizenship was eliminated, all American parents would have to establish the citizenship of their children, through arduous, expensive, bureaucratic processes. The United States would likely have to create a national 'birth registry,' and some sort of national ID to be used as proof of citizenship. Americans could be denied citizenship because of a mistake.

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Look, our approach on legalizing marijuana is not about creating a boutique industry or bringing in tax revenue, it’s based on two very simple principles: The first one is, young people have easier access to cannabis now… And whatever you might think or studies seen about cannabis being less harmful than alcohol or even cigarettes, the fact is it is bad for the developing brain and we need to make sure that it’s harder for underage Canadians to access marijuana. And that will happen under a controlled and regulated regime. The other piece of it is there are billions upon billions of dollars flowing into the pockets of organized crime, street gangs and gun-runners, because of the illicit marijuana trade, and if we can get that out of the criminal elements and into a more regulated fashion we will reduce the amount of criminal activity that’s profiting from those, and that has offshoots into so many other criminal activities.”

This language appears on the face to prohibit the use of any data collection with regard to use firearms. Does this section provide adequate protection for gun owners, and specifically for veterans?  Answer: This language (section 2716) prohibits the use of the federal database for storing information about who has a gun (based on questions asked by a physician with respect to gun ownership).  It does not prohibit the use of the database to determine who has a psychological 'disorder' like ADHD or PTSD. And it does not prohibit the ATF from trolling the database for persons with ADHD and PTSD (independent of any issue of gun ownership) — and sending their names to the FBI's database of prohibited persons because they are 'mental defectives' (18 U.S.C. 922 (g)). HIPAA would not prohibit this 'law enforcement function,' and ObamaCare may significantly broaden the list of people whose determination is an 'official' determination similar to the VA psychiatrists who have disarmed 150,000 veterans.  To say that the health care database would never be used this way is to ignore history.

10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 as the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency. It was intended to contain costs and achieve near-universal access to affordable health care of improved quality. Now, five years later, it is time to assess its track record… Based on the evidence, one has to conclude that containment of health care costs is nowhere in sight, that more than 37 million Americans will still be uninsured when the ACA is fully implemented in 2019, that many more millions will be underinsured, and that profiteering will still dominate the culture of U.S. health care…  The ACA built upon the flaws of our market-based system and, quite predictably, is failing to contain costs and provide broad access to affordable, quality health care. Corporate interests still trump the common good in U.S. health care. More fundamental reform is required based upon universal access to health care as a right… Until that happens, we can expect continued turmoil and increasing public backlash to a dysfunctional system that places profits over service. It is just a matter of time before the country will be forced to choose between discredited, deregulated markets and a more efficient single-payer system that ensures access to essential health care for all Americans."""

10	Do the Health Insurance Exchanges Benefit Consumers? - DEBATED	"""For those who purchase coverage through Healthcare.gov and the state exchanges, their premiums increased dramatically when the law was first implemented in 2014 compared to what comparable coverage cost in the individual market prior to the law's implementation. Furthermore, as a new Heritage Foundation analysis shows, premiums in the exchanges are continuing to rise in 2015, albeit at a slower rate compared to the huge 2014 increases...  Another stated goal of Obamacare was increased insurer competition - another area, unfortunately, where the law has not only failed, but made matters worse. If you compare insurer participation in Obamacare's exchanges to the individual market prior to the law's implementation, you find that the exchanges are about 21 percent less competitive at the state-level in 2015.  State-level numbers on insurer competition often overstates the actual choice available to consumers because insurance is generally priced and sold on a county or regional basis. Indeed, one-third of the nation's counties only have one or two insurers offering coverage on their Obamacare exchange in 2015. That means insurer choice is either incredibly limited or non-existent for consumers in these areas.  Another 25 percent of counties only have three insurers offering coverage. Thus, the exchange market in 57 percent of U.S. counties features competition among three or fewer insurers in 2015."""

So for example, in the United States, if gold was discovered in California and the amount of gold in the economy goes up, that will cause an inflation, whereas if the economy is growing faster and there’s a shortage of gold, that will cause a deflation. So over shorter periods of time, you frequently had both inflations and deflations… I think though that the gold standard would not be feasible for both practical reasons and policy reasons. On the practical side, it is just a simple fact there is not enough gold to meet the needs of a global gold standard and achieving that much gold would be very expensive. In a modern world, the commitment to the gold standard would mean that we are swearing that under no circumstances, no matter how bad unemployment gets, are we going to do anything about it using monetary policy… So I understand the impulse but I think if you look at actual history, you’ll see that the gold standard didn’t work that well and it worked particularly poorly after World War I. Indeed, well I won’t go into it, there’s a good bit of evidence that the gold standard was one of the main reasons that the depression was so deep and long. And a striking fact is that countries that left the gold standard early and gave themselves flexibility on monetary policy recovered much more quickly.”
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	"Student loan debt often forces college graduates to live with their parents and delay marriage, financial independence, and other adult milestones. 20% of millennials are homeowners, and most millennials say their student debt has delayed home ownership by seven years on average. [121] Auto loans are also trending down at faster rates for those with student debt history than for those without. [35] In 2013, student loan borrowers delayed retirement saving (41%), car purchases (40%), home purchases (29%), and marriage (15%). [38] Less than 50% of women and 30% of men had passed the ""transition to adulthood"" milestones by age 30 (finishing school, moving out of their parents' homes, being financially independent, marrying, and having children); in 1960, 77% of women and 65% of men had completed these milestones by age 30.

01	Should Fighting Be Allowed in Hockey? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Fighting draws fans and increases the game's entertainment value. A majority of hockey fans oppose a fighting ban and think the on-ice scuffles are a significant part of the game at the pro level, according to a poll in the Toronto Star newspaper. [19] Travis Hughes, SB Nation hockey writer, said, ""Fighting exists in hockey because we enjoy watching people fight."" [20] Hockey fight clips get shown on ESPN's SportsCenter and have millions of views on YouTube. [21] Brawls increase attendance: an economic study of hockey found that ""violence, specifically fighting, tends to attract fans in large numbers across the United States and Canada."" [22] Fights help the NHL stand out from other sports because no other team sports sanction brawling. SportsCenter anchor John Buccigross wrote, ""Fights can add entertainment value, change a game and have fans talking for days."" [23] Rich Clune, a Maple Leafs forward and long-time fighter, said, ""I think the NHL is cognizant of the fact that they can't eliminate it and turn it into a non-contact sport because I don't think it'll sell... especially in America where the game is still growing.""

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"The enforcement of marijuana prohibition is racist because people of color are disproportionately impacted. Statistics show a significant racial disparity in the enforcement of marijuana laws: even though white and black people use marijuana at roughly the same rate, a black person in the United States is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession on average. [24] In Iowa, the state with the highest inequity, black people are 8.3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people. [21] In New York City, 15.8% of marijuana possession cases involving white people result in conviction, compared to 32.3% involving black people and 30% involving Hispanic people. [27] Marijuana possession convictions can impact people's ability to get public housing, financial aid for school, loans, and jobs. [21] Over the past ten years, drug sentences for black men have been 9% to 13% longer than those received by white men. [28] Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, Criminal Justice and Drug Policy director for the ACLU of California, stated, ""Racial disparities in marijuana enforcement are widespread and longstanding.""

It will probably take at least three or four decades, and will fundamentally change the way we live...  Nearly everyone agrees that the easiest way to kick-start the transition would be to replace coal with solar and wind power for electricity generation...  The collective weight of these challenges and opportunities suggests that a truly all-renewable economy may be very different from the American economy we know today. The renewable economy will likely be slower and more local; it will probably be a conserver economy rather than a consumer economy. It will also likely feature far less economic inequality."""

The crisis of intelligence that pundits and politicians should be considering is not why so many officials overestimated what was wrong in Iraq; it is why they ignored so much readily available evidence of what was right about existing policies. By disregarding the success of inspections and sanctions, Washington discarded an effective system of containment and deterrence and, on the basis of faulty intelligence and wrong assumptions, launched a preventive war in its place.""

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	MLDA 21 reduces alcohol consumption and the number of underage drinkers. 87% of studies, according to a meta study on MLDA, found higher legal drinking ages associated with lower alcohol consumption. [19] Studies indicate that when the drinking age is 21, those younger than 21 drink less and continue to drink less through their early 20s, and that youth who do not drink until they are 21 tend to drink less as adults. [42] The number of 18-to-20 year-olds who report drinking alcohol in the past month has decreased from 59% in 1985 – one year after Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act – to 39% in 2016.

10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Obama vows to create around 5 million new jobs by increasing federal spending on renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biofuels...  As many experts have observed, the science behind the Obama plan is dubious, particularly when it comes to ethanol. The renewable energy industry simply does not have the capacity—at least not yet—to power large swathes of our fossil fuel–driven economy…  We are to believe that replacing conventional energy sources (especially coal) with renewables (especially wind) will create five million new 'green jobs.' The hope is that armies of workers will be enlisted to build tens of thousands of windmills; to manufacture and deploy solar-power installations; to harvest, transport, and process huge amounts of biofuel feedstock; and to string the power lines that will allow the U.S. power grid to incorporate a major expansion of intermittent energy.  Unfortunately, the idea of government 'job creation' is a classic example of the broken window fallacy…  The 'broken windows' in this case would be lost jobs and lost capital in the coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and automobile industries. These industries currently employ more than one million people directly. Conventional power plants would be closed and massive amounts of energy infrastructure would be dismantled. After breaking these windows, the Obama plan would then create new jobs in the renewable energy sector. The costs of replacing those windows would ultimately be passed on to taxpayers and energy consumers."""
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	"Drone strikes are subject to a strict review process and congressional oversight. President Obama, in his ""Presidential Policy Guidance"" released on May 23, 2013, established five criteria that must be met before lethal action may be taken against a foreign target: ""1) Near certainty that the terrorist target is present; 2) Near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed; 3) An assessment that capture is not feasible at the time of the operation; 4) An assessment that the relevant governmental authorities in the country where action is contemplated cannot or will not effectively address the threat to U.S. persons; and 5) An assessment that no other reasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat to U.S. persons."" [33] Intelligence committees and ""appropriate"" members of Congress are briefed on every strike that America takes.

01	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""While antiprostitution laws have done little to stem the thriving industry in recreational sex, they exact a high price on public health and safety. Although violence is not intrinsic to the sex trade... many sex workers fear getting arrested if they report violent clients or exploitative pimps. Hence, criminalization allows killers and others to prey on women with impunity. Predators target prostitutes precisely because they are less likely to go to the police, and nonprostitutes are victimized as well when killers go unchecked...

10	Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Student loan discharge would allow borrowers to abuse the loan system. Making it easier to discharge loans would give people an incentive to take out loans with no intention of paying them back, or to borrow more than they need. [12] 30% of college students polled by LendEDU said they used student loan money to pay for spring break trips. [13] Allowing students to discharge educational debt could cause them to seek bankruptcy without fully realizing the consequences on credit scores, property, and wages. [14] One study found that reinstating bankruptcy protection would increase loan defaults by 18%. [15] A Heritage Foundation study said, ""Students who borrow money for college shouldn't be bailed out–bailouts only encourage additional bad behavior by future students."" [16] New college graduates rarely have significant assets to surrender in bankruptcy, so they have less incentive to avoid bankruptcy. [23]"
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying, and fighting.

I'm opposed to pimping being legal. I'm opposed to brothel keeping being legal. I think we need to absolutely keep as many barriers up as possible. We want to create a sense that buying sex from a woman is socially unacceptable and legally unacceptable…  Prostitution is a despairing, horrible condition for any women and girl who should end up there.

They point to a tiny fraction of sex workers who actually might be involved by choice. They selectively read history to find some tiny minority, somewhere, at some time, who gained something in the sex business.  The very selectiveness of their attention indicates that, on some level, they know that for almost everyone, involvement in the sex industry is a terrible misfortune.

10	Is Legal Prostitution a Part of Sexual Liberation?	"""If women enter prostitution for 'sexual liberation,' what is it they need to be liberated from? Are they seeking liberation from a male-imposed double standard of sexuality? Are they seeking liberation from their own moral or religious qualms - preached by mail priests and ministers? What are they seeking liberation to? To do what they want when they want it - or when someone else does? If women were truly free, we would not need to be liberated from anything. The reason women need liberation at all is because males imprison us. To seek escape from a prison cell is liberation, but when women are living in a global patriarchy, we can never escape the cell."""

"""On the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine - and more than two months after the massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan... It is time to recognize that nuclear power is not a clean, safe or affordable source of energy.  We are deeply disturbed that the lives of people in Japan are being endangered by nuclear radiation in the air, in the water and in the food as a result of the breakdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. We firmly believe that if the world phases out its current use of nuclear power, future generations of people everywhere - and the Japanese people who have already suffered too much - will live in greater peace and security...  [R]adiation is not just a concern in a nuclear accident. Each link in the nuclear fuel chain releases radiation, starting with drilling for uranium; it then continues for generations because nuclear waste includes plutonium that will remain toxic for thousands of years. Despite years of research, countries with nuclear energy programs such as the United States have failed to solve the challenge of finding safe and secure storage for 'spent' nuclear fuel... There are presently over 400 nuclear power plants in the world - many, in places at high risk for natural disaster or political upheaval. These plants provide less than 7% of the world's total energy supply.

Legalization won't stop that. More than likely, male abusers still will profit from trafficking their victims — this time, in legalized locations facilitated and regulated by the government itself.  Legalization would put lipstick on modern-day slavery and call it another step in the liberation of women.  I would say the idea that prostitution should be legalized is wrong. For those few who suggest otherwise, I would argue sex for money is illegal not just because it's immoral, but because it's just plain bad for women at every level."""
10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	"Medical breakthroughs involving animal research may still have been made without the use of animals.

Even when the women are tested for medical conditions, the tests are unreliable and invalid because many tests take days or weeks before the results are available. During that time, the women see more men who could be infected...  Arguing that STD testing prevents disease is like arguing that pregnancy tests prevent pregnancy.

10	If a Software 'Patch' Is Installed, Are Electronic Voting Machines Re-tested prior to Being Used on Election Day?	"""A vendor may uncover a potentially problematic issue in software that has been previously certified and address the issue in a program patch. Strictly speaking, any change to a program requires recertification, and some state laws require recertification after every software change, no matter how small. But because full recertification generally takes a long time (in principle, as long as the initial certification), there are strong incentives for the vendor to argue that the change can be administratively approved.  The question then arises whether the change involved is small enough to be addressed administratively. In the absence of specific criteria, vendors are in the best position to know about the scope and significance of any change... If an administrative certification is not possible, election officials have the operational choice in practice between running certified code that may have problems or running uncertified code that has been fixed. Thus, some election officials may still try to think of ways to avoid this certification step."""

Nobody wants any item of clothing that the other is wearing; all are equally undesirable, so thieving and general adolescent covetousness are reduced… A uniform is not the same thing as a dress code… No endless back and forth between child, parents and school. Moreover, when a kid’s in uniform, he or she sticks out like a sore thumb. The local community knows where that kid belongs. It’s harder for kids to skip school or get into trouble outside school.

Their victimization is evident from any point of view physically, socially, and legally.   Prostitution is definitely not a victimless crime. Women in prostitution are victimized on an hourly basis and they are also victimized at the time of recruitment because they are victims of multiple discriminations as being girls, being poor, and very often being from marginalized race or caste communities."""
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“In many societies most people drink and they begin doing so in the home from a very early age. There is neither evidence or any reason to even suspect that members of these groups are brain impaired compared to those societies that do not permit young people to consume alcohol. There appears to be absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the light or moderate consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 causes any brain impairment or harm.”
01	Is a College Education Worth It?	“In boom times and recession, labor market figures consistently show that college graduates have a much lower unemployment rate than their less-educated peers… [P]reparing students for careers is just one important part of what colleges do. For example, in a recent national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, more than 90% of college graduates reported that college helped them grow intellectually and mature as individuals. College expands students’ horizons, exposes them to ideas and fields of study they might not encounter otherwise and fosters relationships with diverse peers. It prepares people to become engaged citizens in ways that few other experiences can… Time and again, countries have relied on colleges and universities as the surefire way to expand their economies and promote social mobility. In the 1950s, the dramatic expansion of higher education in the United States helped create the American middle class. In one generation, South Korea propelled itself from the ranks of the world’s poorest nations to among the world’s richest, in large part by emphasizing higher education.”

I think if you look at anything, from all of these attacks that have taken place, is if people actually had had weapons there those attacks would have been thwarted and people’s lives would have been saved. In fact, there are millions of lives that are saved in America every year, millions of instances where gun owners have prevented crimes and stopped things from happening because of having guns at the scene… You know, everybody romanticizes the O.K. Corral and all the horrible things that happened, but gun crimes were not very prevalent back then. Why? Because people carried guns. And, you know, the folks who use guns in the commission of crimes are cowards. And if you look at going to theatres, they went to a theatre in Aurora, Colorado, that they knew, you know, you could go there and no one else was going to be there with a gun. If we are a country where the criminal doesn’t know whether someone has a gun or not, they’re going to think twice about opening fire or not because they won’t be able to accomplish what they want. It’s a wrong-headed approach that somehow or another, if we take guns away from people, law-abiding people who want to protect themselves, that the world’s going to be safer. In fact, just the opposite is the case.”

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""One cannot support the reduction of AIDS infections and support legal prostitution at the same time. Prostitution remains one of the leading vectors for AIDS infection. This is true in the case of both legal and illegal prostitution...   Prostitutes, because of their many partners, have a greatly increased risk of exposure to HIV. They are likewise able to spread HIV to many other partners...  The redefinition of prostitution as 'commercial sex work' is just an attempt to legitimize sex trafficking. It should come as no surprise the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have signed on. While both groups are considered 'pro-woman', it is odd that they support an industry of flagrant abuse of women...  There are a multitude of studies to show the high level of abuse that prostitutes suffer. Women are literally bought and sold as property. The incidence of drug addiction is high among women, partially explaining why they became prostitutes to begin with.  The argument for legalization goes something like this. Prostitution will happen anyway but legalization and regulation will help stem the abuses. The argument has 50,000 foot appeal. Using the same logic, slavery (which still exists in many places) should be legalized so underground slaves can be given some measure of human rights. The fact that the ACLU and the bevy of left-wing international groups don't argue for the legalization of slavery shows the logical inconsistency of their position.  Further, the legalization of abortion has shown that it lead to a radical increase in abortion. The legalization will lead to an untold number of women being forced into sex slavery. Make no mistake, women will be forced into commercial sex work in greater numbers if it were legalized."""
10	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Severe / Chronic Pain?	is no scientific evidence that the effect of marijuana in diminishing pain is related to any specifically identified analgesic effect. That it unequivocally does produce a short-term CNS [central nervous system] euphoria, which alleviates some pain centrally, best explains its mechanism for both reducing pain short-term during the period of influence as well as causing the euphoria associated with addictive drugs of abuse. Additionally, there is no scientific evidence that long-term use of medicinal marijuana is either effective or safe for the treatment of chronic pain… [T]here are many analgesic medications available to patients and physicians that have been proven and established in the practice of medicine, through sound scientific clinical research, to be more effective and safer for the treatment of chronic pain than medical marijuana.”

Every year around this time, the ‘culture warriors’ renew their holiday howls decrying the ACLU’s ‘War on Christmas.’ This ritual of bombast and disinformation misleads many people to believe that the ACLU is on a mission to remove Christmas from the public consciousness… In reality, the ACLU is a tireless defender of the constitutional right of people to worship, preach, sing carols and celebrate religious holidays- both in public and in private. Have a nativity scene on the lawn of your church? Great! Display a menorah in the front window of your home? No problem. Want to go caroling with your friends? We’ll bring the cookies and cider! And if the government ever tries to take these rights away, give us a call. What the ACLU does oppose is the government favoring a specific set of religious beliefs to the exclusion of others. The Bill of Rights establishes that the government should not be in the business of endorsing any one religion. For that reason, the ACLU takes issue when the government sponsors a religious display- not because we are waging war on Christmas or any other religious holiday- but because it’s unconstitutional.”

[176] This suggests that many women are using abortion as a contraceptive method. [78] Freakonomics co-author Steven Levitt, PhD, wrote that after abortion was legalized, ""Conceptions rose by nearly 30 percent, but births actually fell by 6 percent, indicating that many women were using abortion as a method of birth control, a crude and drastic sort of insurance policy.""

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""I have listened for my whole professional life to a false dialogue. For years, policy makers and opinion leaders have argued over 'solutions' that are unreal or at last tangential: We keep chanting the dirge: one can almost put it to music -- one state or two states. Neither is realistic and even if feasible would not solve the fundamental problem. But we seem to believe that, if we can say one or the other often enough, one of them might become acceptable. It is time to drop the nonsense and face the simple facts. They are:   In the 'one state,' the Arabs will be the subjugated minority with few rights and little or any security -- they will be the 'Jews' of an Israeli Germany or an Israeli Imperial Russia, cooped up in ghettos, imprisoned, driven into exile or subjected to a final partition. They, their children and their grandchildren will sporadically resist. Their resistance will call forth more hatred and more reprisal. The cycle will continue.   In the 'two states,' those living in the truncated remnants of Palestine (the West Bank and Gaza) will be condemned to perpetual poverty and humiliation. They will have almost no usable agricultural land and virtually no water. They will be cut off from possible markets for what little they can produce. They can have no hope of manufacturing because their draw on electricity will be squeezed. Even the limited money they can earn will be closely controlled and often blocked by the Israeli Central Bank as it now is. They will have limited access to health facilities, educational institutions and even contact with one another, segregated as they are and will be by restricted zones, walls and standing security and military forces. They, their children and their grandchildren will sporadically resist or attempt to strike back."""

The Hippocratic Oath explicitly forbids assistedsuicide/euthanasia by requiring doctors to pledge, 'to give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect.' The Christian ethicist, Gilbert Meilaender, interprets the Oath as creating a positive obligation for physicians to 'be committed to the bodily life of their patients.' Assisted-suicide/euthanasia clearly conflicts with this moral obligation since it is an act intended to end the patient’s bodily life. This is one reason why organized medicine—ranging from the World Medical Association, to the American Medical Association (AMA), to almost all of the state medical associations—overwhelmingly opposes legalizing assisted-suicide/euthanasia."""

Many politicians want to substitute other domestically produced liquid fuels for oil and assure the public that they are around the corner. They are not.  There is now no liquid fuel that can largely replace oil for transportation. We are stuck because of the scale of the industry and - despite criticism - oil's efficiency. A gallon of gas, refined from African oil, is cheaper than a gallon of Maine sparkling water. Political alternatives like corn-based ethanol have required huge subsidies and convulsed food markets but produced only 430,000 barrels per day in 2007 - 2 percent of U.S. oil consumption...

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"Legalizing marijuana would end the costly enforcement of marijuana laws and free up police resources. Arresting people for marijuana possession costs the United States between $1.19 billion and $6.03 billion annually. [24][21] These costs include police, judicial, legal, and corrections expenses. Incarcerating marijuana offenders costs the United States an estimated $600 million per year. [63] Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has estimated that marijuana legalization would save between $7.7 billion and $13.7 billion annually. [60][61] Instead of arresting people for marijuana, police officers could focus on serious crimes including rape, assault, and homicide. [62] For example, marijuana legalization in Washington significantly freed up law enforcement resources; marijuana possession arrests dropped from 5,531 the year before legalization to 120 the year after.

In court, slick lawyers will argue that the oath in the pledge does not establish a religion because the words 'under God' have 'no significant religious content.'

Prostitution creates a setting whereby crimes against men, women, and children become a commercial enterprise... It is an assault when he/she forces a prostitute to engage in sadomasochistic sex scenes. When a pimp compels a prostitute to submit to sexual demands as a condition of employment, it is exploitation, sexual harassment, or rape -- acts that are based on the prostitute's compliance rather than her consent. The fact that a pimp or customer gives money to a prostitute for submitting to these acts does not alter the fact that child sexual abuse, rape, and/or battery occurs; it merely redefines these crimes as prostitution."""
10	Is Parallel Testing an Effective Method of Assuring the Accuracy of Electronic Voting Machines?	"""While [parallel] testing is valuable, and should be used during every election, it can fail to achieve its purpose in a number of ways. First, the testing conditions, including the vote stream, must be truly indistinguishable from those that obtain during regular voting... A cheat might observe the vote stream and notice that votes are being cast much more rapidly than during regular voting, or that a block of votes was cast during the first hour of the election, then none for the remainder of the day... It is very difficult to design a test that, even when executed perfectly, outwits a determined adversary.  Second, a communications device could be used to tell the voting station how to detect the latest testing procedures. Third, the test must actually be performed diligently and in a statistically-significant set of precincts... Given this, it seems likely that parallel testing often will fail of its purpose. This failure will be particularly acute if the first few tests 'find nothing,' since that will create a natural tendency to view the process as pointless. Fourth, elections officials must actually believe, and act properly upon, the suggestion or discovery of cheating. Far too often officials treat anomalies (such as the one in which 600 voters somehow cast 3,900 votes for a Presidential candidate in Ohio - using DREs) as 'glitches,' and merely remove the offending machine(s) from service."""
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is an excellent way to meet the growing demand for medical information, empowering consumers by educating them about health conditions and possible treatments. By so doing, it can play an important role in improving public health… Direct-to-consumer advertising that encourages millions of Americans to consult their physicians can help to improve public health because a number of leading diseases are under diagnosed and under-treated… Direct-to-consumer advertising is a highly effective way to communicate the availability of treatments to the public. In 1992, the first DTC consumer television advertisement for a nicotine patch aired during the Super Bowl. According to the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA), the public response was so great that, within weeks, demand for the patches exceeded the supply. The product had been available for months, but people who might have been interested in quitting smoking were simply not aware of it. Advertising promoted widespread awareness overnight, prompted patient-physician conversations, and may have helped many people to stop smoking. Pharmaceutical companies have both a right and a responsibility to inform people about their products under the supervision of the FDA, which regulates prescription drug advertising. Companies are committed to responsible advertising that enhances the patient-physician relationship and encourages the appropriate use of prescription drugs under a physician’s supervision. While such advertising prompts more people to seek professional help, it does not dictate the outcome of the physician visit or the kind of help patients eventually receive. Direct-to-consumer advertising merely motivates patients to learn more about medical conditions and treatment options and to consult their physicians.”

Dramatic Haiti earthquake Twitter pictures swept across the web, while tech giants mobilized. The most impressive part of social media’s impact on Haiti has to be the charity text message campaign that has already raised more than $10 million for Haiti victim relief.

We were let down.  This year alone, Obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. Individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. Under the two most popular Obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median American household income. This is not affordable.  Obama's promise of 'choice' has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges.

That loophole, known as deferral, lets corporations avoid paying any United States taxes on their offshore profits until they are brought back here. That’s why, according to a recent survey by tax researchers, Fortune 500 companies are holding nearly $2.5 trillion in profits that are booked offshore, mostly in tax havens, on which no United States taxes have been paid… [A]s with many other American multinationals, cutting federal taxes wouldn’t affect their investment and employment decisions because they already pay very little… Corporate tax cuts do not create a great many jobs. Another study found that every dollar reduction in corporate taxes adds only 32 cents to the economy. The same dollar spent on infrastructure generates $1.44 of economic activity. America’s corporate tax rate is not discouraging foreign corporations and individuals from investing here. Their investments in the United States for last year alone reached $348 billion, a record high. The corporate clamor for tax cuts has nothing to do with job creation. It’s about lining the pockets of corporate executives and wealthy shareholders through ever-higher dividends and ever-bigger stock buybacks.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Any comprehensive strategy must recognize that our energy challenges have been decades in the making and certainly won't be resolved overnight. So even as we rightly place a great deal of emphasis on renewable energy and alternative fuels, it is clear that our economy is – and will remain for some time – dependent on fossil energy. We must diversify the available supply of conventional fuels and expand production around the world and here at home– including within a small area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and portions of America's Outer Continental Shelf – in an environmentally sensitive and efficient manner. Also, we must maintain an adequate liquefied natural gas infrastructure and promote the development of nontraditional fossil fuels like oil shale and oil sands."""
01	Does Obamacare Restrict Insurance Companies' Profits? – YES	"""[The PPACA] takes steps to limit the boundless profiteering that has become customary in the U.S. health care system...  States have two new tools to prevent health plans from gouging consumers. First, 46 states have received grants from the US Department of Health and Human Services to investigate premium rate increases. This funding will give states the resources to review the complicated actuarial explanations filed by insurance companies and to judge whether premium increases are justified. In addition, plans will now be required to devote a minimum percentage of their premium revenue to medical care instead of administration, executive salaries, profits, lobbying and administrative waste. Plans will owe their customers rebates if they fail to spend at least 80 percent (individual and small group) or 85 percent (large group) of premium dollars on medical expenses."""

10	Does Buddhism Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	misconduct (kâmamithyâcarâ; kamesu micchacara) is supposed to be avoided by the pious laity as well as the clergy. Buddhist tradition essentially conceives of sexual misconduct in terms of sexual relations with various types of prohibited women (agamyâ) and the performance of nonprocreative sexual acts. Among the commentators only Buddhaghosa and the anonymous author of the commentary to the Abhidharmasamucaya include men among forbidden sexual objects. The Vinaya punishes all intentional sexual conduct by monks or nuns, providing a hierarchy of penalties depending upon the nature of the offense. Penetration with emission results in expulsion from the order, regardless of the gender or species of the partner or the orifice penetrated. Other types of sexual contact, such as masturbation of one monk by another, although still a serious offense, does not require expulsion, and nonorgasmic contact such as touching another’s genitals is a relatively minor offense. As a rule, offenses committed with a pa??aka require less severe punishment than those involving a woman, although more than if they were committed with a socially normative man. Mutual masturbation among nuns is also reckoned with, but is considered a relatively minor offense… As to the ordination of the sexually nonconformist male, it will certainly be no surprise to find ordination denied to such individuals and that such denial has solid canonical authority.”
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“God has given us life, and life is sacred and good. God has also given us the responsibility to make decisions which reflect a reverence for life in circumstances when conflicting realities are present. Jesus affirmed women as full partners in the faith, capable of making decisions that affect their lives… The United Church of Christ has affirmed and re-affirmed since 1971 that access to safe and legal abortion is consistent with a woman’s right to follow the dictates of her own faith and beliefs in determining when and if she should have children, and it has supported comprehensive sexuality education as one measure to prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies, and to create healthy and responsible sexual persons and relationships…. We have also supported that women with limited financial means should be able to receive public funding in order to exercise her legal right to the full range of reproductive health services. What is legally available to women must be accessible to all women.”
01	Does Buddhism Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	to the ancient Indian understanding, homosexuals were thought of simply as being ‘the third nature’ (tritiya prakti), rather than as perverted, deviant or sick. With its emphasis on psychology and cause and effect, Buddhism judges acts, including sexual acts, primarily by the intention (cetana) behind them and the effect they have. A sexual act motivated by love, mutuality and the desire to give and share would be judged positive no matter what the gender of the two persons involved. Therefore, homosexuality as such is not considered immoral in Buddhism or against the third precept, although this is not always understood in traditional Buddhist countries. If a homosexual avoids the sensuality and licence of the so-called ‘gay scene’ and enters into a loving relationship with another person, there is no reason why he or she cannot be a sincere practising Buddhist and enjoy all the blessings of the Buddhist life.”
10	Does Judaism Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	two verses in the book of Leviticus (18:22 and 20:13) which deal with homosexuality are really quite clear, despite the efforts of some to call their clarity into question. Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 absolutely forbid homosexual intercourse between males. The Rabbis, in the Sifra (Aharei Mot 9:8), also understand the Torah to forbid lesbianism. The Torah’s prohibitions, let it be clear, are against actions, like male homosexual intercourse, not against fantasies or attractions. The Torah and the Rabbis do not distinguish between types of homosexuals in any way… The Rabbis were well able to conceive of monogamous and loving relationships between members of the same sex, and I quote in my paper the texts that prove this beyond reasonable question. But their words cannot possibly be read to imply that such monogamous or loving gay relationships are in a different halakhic [Jewish legal] category than any other relationships between members of the same sex. The prohibition is clear and total.”

Census Bureau data reveal that for most students with some college and no degree, it actually pays—in pure earnings premiums—to pursue a professional certification or educational certificate instead of a stand-alone associate’s degree… Today, many employers demand more and higher academic credentials because of their dissatisfaction with the quality of degree-holders… Continued focus on a college degree loses sight of the needs of most first-generation, low-income and minority students… College is not the only path into the middle class.”

Nearly 60 percent of the people on earth are currently malnourished according to the World Health Organization. Growing crops for fuel squanders land, water, and energy vital for human food production.  The use of corn for ethanol has led to major increases in the price of U.S. beef, chicken, pork, eggs, breads, cereals, and milk -- a boon to agribusiness and bane to consumers. Director General of the U.N. Food & Agriculture Organization Jacques Diouf reports that using 22 pounds of corn to produce one gallon of ethanol is already causing food shortages for the world's poor.  One last set of statistics: The global population stands at 6.6 billion: a quarter--million mouths to feed are added daily. Energy experts report that peak oil production has already been reached. As cheap oil supplies decline, fuel prices will rise, causing food prices to climb too (because maximum agricultural production requires fossil fuel inputs).  As global population soars to 8 or 9 billion toward mid-century, and as we burn more grain as fuel, shortages and production costs could cause grain prices to skyrocket, taking food from the mouths of the world's poorest people.

Needless to say, such a technical feat could not be accomplished within a single generation.  The obvious question is why it should be even attempted given the fact that a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions could be achieved by several more rational, mature and readily available adjustments...  [T]technical fixes cannot provide a lasting resolution. History shows that energy demand keeps growing even in the most energy-saturated affluent societies: encouraging worldwide diffusion of this trend (new China, and then India, aspiring to replicate the US) and trying to fill the supply through scientific and engineering ingenuity is not a formula compatible with maintaining a viable biosphere. Obviously, poor countries need more energy; but the rich ones should, sooner, rather than later, think about engineering rational reductions in energy use. All economies are just subsystems of the biosphere and the first law of ecology is that no trees grow to heaven. If we are not going to engineer thoughtful, gradual reductions, we run a considerable risk that the biosphere may do the scaling-down for us in a much less desirable (if not catastrophic) manner."""

Thus, absent two states, and as equality in binationalism is a fantasy, the prospects of one Arab state undoing our Zionist dream looms large…   It is either two states by choice or one — Arab — state by default… This little house of ours must be partitioned to two smaller apartments. And let there be a good fence between them, contributing to good neighborliness. Once divorced, let us experience coexistence and leave notions of possible cohabitation to future generations. Ours is not a Hollywood western of good vs. evil. It is a real life tragedy of two just causes. We can continue to clash, inflicting further pain. Or we can be reconciled via separation and compromise."""

As reflected in CBO's latest baseline projections, the two agencies now anticipate that, because of the ACA, about 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case under prior law.""  [Editor's Note: A table from the CBO's updated ""May 2013 Estimate of the Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance Coverage"" explains that ""the change in employment-based coverage is the net result of projected increases in and losses of offers of health insurance from employers and changes in enrollment by workers and their families. For example, in 2019, an estimated 11 million people who would have had an offer of employment-based coverage under prior law will lose their offer under current law, and another 3 million people will have an offer of employment-based coverage but will enroll in health insurance from another source instead. These flows out of employment-based coverage will be partially offset by an estimated 7 million people who will newly enroll in employment-based coverage under the Affordable Care Act.""]"

To ignore human and animal suffering is irresponsible and unethical. Nearly every major medical advance of the 20th century has depended largely on research with animals. Our best hope for developing preventions, treatments and cures for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, AIDS and cancer will also involve biomedical research using animals. In fact, research on animals is in many cases an obligation. According to the Nuremburg Code, drawn up after World War II as a result of Nazi atrocities, any experiments on humans ‘should be designed and based on the results of animal experimentation.’… The Declaration of Helsinki, adopted in 1964 by the 18th World Medical Assembly and revised in 1975, also states that medical research on human subjects ‘should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal experimentation.”

Yet if it were a Christian nation - truly was a nation that followed the teachings and example of the man from Nazareth - then two things would most certainly be true: First, we would spend considerably less time arguing about what to call things, and how to celebrate things, and what were the signs of the righteous. Not because we'd all agree, but because in a truly Christian nation we'd know that these outward signs are really of very little significance in the grand scheme of things.

With the outlawing of heresies, enforced by imperial power, no one was in a position to contradict the established doctrine of the Church. If the Church decided that Jesus meant only persons suffering from anatomical birth defects in Matthew 19:12, who would have been in a position to object? If the now imperial Church found that a homosexual engaging in his own natural sexuality was guilty of the sin of Sodom, who would stand up to argue?

This waste is actually a cocktail of chemicals such as Cesium-137, Iodine-129, Strontium-90, and Plutonium-239, each radioactive and cancer-causing. Waste decays slowly remaining in dangerous amounts for thousands of years, and must be kept from escaping into the air, water, and food...  Another potential health problem is a large-scale release of radioactivity from a meltdown...  Even if a disastrous meltdown never occurred, a small portion of radioactivity must be released from reactors. This radioactivity enters the human body through breathing and the food chain, as gases and tiny metal particles. They kill and injure healthy cells, leading to cancer, and are especially harmful to the fetus, infant, and child...  There is no need to increase cancer risk by introducing a hazardous means of producing electricity. Replacing coal to limit global warming should not be based on another toxic product.

The challenge before us today is to resist the fear that leads to repression and to promote liberty at the very time it is under attack… By restricting liberty without significantly increasing security, Mr. [Former U.S. Attorney General John] Ashcroft is sending a false and dangerous message to the American people. His message is that Americans must choose whether they want to be ‘safe or free.’ The ACLU, on the other hand, believes that America can be both ‘safe and free.’ The ACLU does not underestimate the threat to national security, nor do we shrink from the difficult task of defending liberty when it is under attack.”

Obviously, financial constraints are such that health insurance companies are being forced to develop new products that are suitable for the 30 million uninsured Americans who will soon be insured under the law. There will be no room for commissions in the new lower cost products...  There will be a huge migration of business from traditional healthcare insurance agents and brokers to the exchanges...

In June 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court made quite clear that these actions are legally distinct. There is a constitutional right to refuse medical treatments and even have a proxy exercise that refusal, while, by a vote of 9 to 0, the Court clearly stated that there is no constitutional right for either euthanasia or PAS. There is also a moral distinction. The safeguards we think appropriate and necessary for permitting euthanasia or PAS are not necessary for terminating medical care...

Long-term studies of high school students and their patterns of drug use show that very few young people use other illegal drugs without first trying marijuana. While not all people who use marijuana go on to use other drugs, using marijuana puts children and teens in contact with people who are users and sellers of other drugs, so there is more of a risk that a marijuana user will be exposed to and urged to try more dangerous drugs. A recent study by Columbia University’s Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found a pronounced difference in future drug use between kids who used marijuana and those who did not. It revealed that teens who smoke marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than those who do not. This means the odds of using other drugs increases with the increased frequency of marijuana smoking.”

However, calcium in foods high in oxalic acid (such as spinach, sweet potatoes, and beans) or phytic acid (such as unleavened bread, raw beans, seeds, and nuts) may be poorly absorbed. Oxalates in particular are strong inhibitors of calcium absorption. As a result, additional servings of certain calcium-rich foods are needed to compensate for their low bioavailability...

The CATO Institute concluded that this law helped to stop a massacre at the New Life megachurch in Dec. 2007 when a volunteer security guard for the church who was carrying a concealed handgun shot an attacker who had opened fire in the church. [61] According to John R. Lott Jr., PhD, ""when states passed concealed carry laws during the 19 years we studied (1977 to 1995), the number of multiple-victim public shootings declined by 84%. Deaths from these shootings plummeted on average by 90%, injuries by 82%."" [62] Read More"

[81] Only 17% of Pakistanis back American drone strikes against leaders of extremist groups, even if they are conducted in conjunction with the Pakistani government. [82] On three separate occasions, Pakistan's Parliament has voted to condemn the attacks and end the country's cooperation with the CIA, [83] and leaders in the FATA voted on Nov. 4, 2013 to block NATO supply lines unless the United States stops its drone strikes. [84] On Dec. 16, 2013, Yemen's parliament passed a motion calling for the United States to end its drone program in the country after a wedding convoy of 11 to 15 people were killed by a US drone strike.

10	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""Turning from proclamation to politics, however, requires much duplicitous testimony. In public, politically powerful preachers will declare that the nation must acknowledge allegiance to God and will contend that the public square would be naked without meaningful references to Deity. In court, slick lawyers will argue that the oath in the pledge does not establish a religion because the words 'under God' have 'no significant religious content.' How fundamentalist Christians can so callously profane the name of their Lord - making it legally meaningless and publicly bearing false witness about it - reveals something about the depth of either their understanding or their spirituality, especially when they are leading a simultaneous crusade to post the Decalogue in public places."""
10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“The concept of over-the-counter birth control ignores the grim reality that not all people can just go to a pharmacy and easily purchase birth control. Some face religious and social backlash for buying pills in full view of their pharmacist and people from their community. Some can’t afford to purchase the pill — if you’re counting pennies and choosing between food and birth control, food wins. Some are young and under a certain state’s law can’t purchase birth control without a parent’s consent. Some are transgender or gender-nonconforming. Some have medical conditions or allergies that place them at risk of serious side effects if the birth control they use isn’t carefully selected and the dosage modified to fit their bodies. The list goes on. The reality is that most, if not all, people who need or use birth control have to find a specific combination of hormones that works for their body. It may shock some of the male politicians who are governing our right to access birth control, but millions of women don’t all just take one type of pill and have one giant mutual menstrual cycle. Each person’s hormones and menses are different, and getting the hormone combination in our birth control just right is just as important as being able to access birth control in the first place.”

"""Several randomized trials found that individuals who received 800 IU per day of vitamin D lowered their risk of osteoporosis; trials that provided only 400 IU per day did not show this benefit. It is reasonable to postulate that more than 800 IU per day would provide even more benefit, but this is not proven...  Milk alone is unlikely to be an adequate source of vitamin D. True, milk is fortified in the U.S. (it is not fortified in most countries). Each glass of fortified milk should contain about 100 IU of vitamin D (but on average, it may contain only 50 IU). So someone would have to drink at least 8 glasses of milk per day to get 800 IU of vitamin D. Moreover, most experts now conclude that 1,000 to 2,000 IU per day of vitamin D may be what we need for optimum health."""

The work adds to a growing literature supporting the notion that in some circumstances pot can offer medical benefits. Treatment for hepatitis C involves months of therapy with two powerful drugs, interferon and ribavirin, that have severe side effects, including extreme fatigue, nausea, muscle aches, loss of appetite and depression. Because of those side effects, many patients do not finish treatment and the virus ends up destroying their livers. While it is possible that the marijuana had a specific, positive biomedical effect, it is more likely that it helped patients by reducing depression, improving appetite and offering psychological benefits that helped the patients tolerate the treatment’s side effects, the team reports in the current issue of the European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology.”

Who opened the samples? What protocol was followed? Nothing. It was all thrown out the door. We cannot build a system of faith and trust in an anti-doping fight if we don't have faith in it.

10	Does Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) Apply to Felon Disenfranchisement Laws?	"""This is a dark day for the Voting Rights Act. In adopting a constitutionally questionable interpretation of the Act, the [9th Circuit Court of Appeals] panel lays the groundwork for the dismantling of the most important piece of civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. The panel also misinterprets the evidence, flouts our voting rights precedent and tramples settled circuit law pertaining to summary judgment, all in an effort to give felons the right to vote...   The panel's decision suffers from a more fundamental flaw: It ignores the fact that the VRA was never intended to reach felon disenfranchisement laws. When Congress enacted the VRA in 1965, it was careful to carve out an exception for felon disenfranchisement laws...

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Contrary to the claims that violent video games are linked to aggressive assaults and homicides, no evidence was found to suggest that this medium was a major (or minor) contributing cause of violence in the United States. Annual trends in video game sales for the past 33 years were unrelated to violent crime both concurrently and up to 4 years later. Unexpectedly, monthly sales of video games were related to concurrent decreases in aggravated assaults and were unrelated to homicides… [H]omicides tended to decrease in the months following the release of popular M-rated violent video games… If video games are really the equivalent of flight simulators training people to kill… it is difficult to explain why homicide rates would go down after millions of these ‘murder simulators’ have been sold. When the media, politicians, or researchers link the murderous rampages of male adolescents with violent video games, they are conveying a classic illusory correlation… These individuals are ignoring that 90% of young males play video games… Finding that a young man who committed a violent crime also played a popular video game, such as Call of Duty, Halo, or Grand Theft Auto, is as pointless as pointing out that the criminal also wore socks. The rhetoric about violent video games does not match the data.”
10	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""It is true that growing corn sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. However, it is also true that using corn products as combustible fuel releases this carbon back into the air. So there is no net benefit in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. But more significant is that fossil energy used in planting and harvesting the corn, and the industrial processing of the corn into ethanol, are all additional greenhouse gas emissions. Farming activities account for a significant amount of the greenhouse gases created by corn ethanol. In addition, most ethanol plants are powered by coal, which has the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions of all the fossil fuels. Industrial operations not powered by coal are powered by natural gas, which also emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases. So the outcome is a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions from corn ethanol regardless of how it is produced...  It must be concluded that corn ethanol's greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions from other agrofuels, are not climate friendly, and may be worse than those from petroleum based gasoline. In addition to these high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, corn ethanol produces a range of other pollutants and public health concerns."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“When the minimum wage is increased, the private sector is responsible for finding the means to actually pay for these increases. Though many companies will be forced to raise prices in order to continue operating within their profit margins, some might be left with no choice but to lay off employees or dramatically cut employee hours. Since minimum wage pay is typically associated with entry-level workers, if employers are forced to let these employees go, they will lack the skills necessary to quickly rebound in the job market. As a result, the unemployment rate begins to rise.”

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Over-the-counter status would decrease privacy.

01	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“In recent years a majority of states have passed laws permitting honest citizens to carry concealed weapons, and the results tell us much about self-defense and the responsibility of the average citizen. Once it was passionately argued that such laws would turn minor altercations into bloody shoot-outs; now we know better. Over 1 million Americans have licenses to carry firearms, but firearms misuse by this group has been utterly negligible. Criminologists now debate not how much harm has been caused by concealed-carry laws, but how much good… [A right to bear arms] says the individual is not simply a helpless bystander in the difficult and dangerous task of ensuring his or her safety. Instead, the citizen is an active participant, an equal partner with the state in ensuring not only his own safety but that of his community. This is a serious right for serious people. It takes the individual from servile dependency on the state to the status of participating citizen, capable of making intelligent choices in defense of one’s life and ultimately one’s freedom. This conception of citizenship recognizes that the ultimate civil right is the right to defend one’s own life, that without that right all other rights are meaningless, and that without the means of self-defense the right to self-defense is but an empty promise.”

Insiders know that many - perhaps most - top players in all sports take drugs to train harder and feel no pain during play. The trainers, sports doctors, nutritionists, physiotherapists and managers of the big names make sure banned substances are taken at the safest and most efficient levels, and when they can, the governing bodies look the other way...  The main effect of banning such substances has been to turn performers and their coaches into liars and cheats. We should legalise performance-enhancing drugs so that they can be regulated and athletes on the way up - whose entourages do not yet include savvy physiotherapists and doctors - don't overdose and do themselves damage."""

It seems, however, to be a foregone conclusion that Parliament will legalize euthanasia (a word I use to refer to both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide), so the issue is how to limit the harms and risks of that.   So, in order to do the least damage possible to important shared societal values, especially respect for human life, and to vulnerable Canadians of legalizing euthanasia, I am willing to provide some recommendations for limiting its harms and risks...   Euthanasia should be restricted to people who are terminally ill (a life expectancy of less than four weeks) from a physical illness, disease or disability and experiencing extreme physical suffering."""
01	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""Prevention of osteoporosis begins in childhood and adolescence because much of genetically determined peak bone mass is accrued during the first two decades of life. Studies in children and adolescents demonstrate that increasing consumption of dairy foods benefits bone health - or that low intake of dairy foods compromises bone health and may increase the risk of bone fractures during growth. Moreover, consuming an adequate intake of milk and other dairy foods during childhood and adolescence may protect against fractures in later years.  Investigations in adults demonstrate that consuming calcium-rich dairy foods such as milk, cheese, or yogurt reduces age related bone loss and risk of osteoporotic fractures.  Milk and other dairy foods are the preferred source of calcium because of their high calcium content and the presence of other nutrients important for bone and overall health."""

For many years, we have turned out more college graduates than the growth in the number of jobs in the technical, managerial, and professional areas where college graduates historically want to work. Therefore, we now have nearly 80,000 bartenders and taxi drivers with bachelor’s degrees. One estimate is that 1 in 3 college graduates has a job historically performed by those with a high school diploma or the equivalent.”

In my view, when the likelihood of coercion is speculative, the reference to God minimal and, in part, historic, and the adult's participation voluntary, I do not believe the Establishment Clause prohibits the use of the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge."""
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	"Abortion may lead to future medical problems for the mother. A study published by the peer-reviewed International Journal of Epidemiology estimated that about 15% of first-trimester miscarriages are attributed to a prior history of induced abortion, and stated that ""Induced abortion by vacuum aspiration is associated with an increased risk of first-trimester miscarriage in the subsequent pregnancy."" [34] A Chinese study published in the peer-reviewed Indian Journal of Cancer found an association between breast cancer and a history of abortions [71].

10	Should the Teammates of Athletes Who Are Found Guilty of Using Performance Enhancing Drugs in the Olympics Also Return Their Medals?	"""The [Marion] Jones situation reminds me of when a few kids act up in class and the teacher cancels recess for everyone. Or when a high school team has to forfeit all of the games it won because one player flunked a class and was ineligible to play...  I understand that sports officials, including those who run the Olympics, need strict rules against cheating. But is it fair to punish everyone on a team because one person makes a mistake?  If her teammates had known Jones was cheating, they probably would have wanted to replace her to make sure they weren't disqualified. But if they simply suspected she might be using illegal drugs -- as some people thought -- what could they have done?...  I think the best solution would be to allow Jones's teammates to keep their medals but award new medals to the other teams -- medals they would have won if Jones's teams hadn't competed."""
01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Each of us put in 20 or more years in the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement entities. And both of us realize that marijuana prohibition is a failed drug policy that should end. Prohibition doesn’t keep marijuana off our streets or decrease use. And it certainly doesn’t keep marijuana out of the hands of teens. But prohibition does result in billions of dollars in profits flowing to drug cartels. This drug money fuels lavish lifestyles among drug lords and deadly violence among rival cartels aiming to protect smuggling territory and street corners. We have seen the consequences of America’s marijuana prohibition policies. It is long past time to allow adults to legally buy marijuana. Taxation and strict regulation should be the mantra when it comes to marijuana. Now that we are retired from the DEA, we can speak out and say that marijuana should be taxed and regulated to keep profits from ruining our streets and causing mayhem south of the border.”
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	Global warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is causing the Arctic ice cap to melt at an increasing rate. From 1953–2006, Arctic sea ice declined 7.8% per decade. Between 1979 and 2006, the decline was 9.1% each decade. [105] As of 2014, Arctic sea ice was being lost at a rate of 13.3% per decade. [163] As the Arctic ice cover continues to decrease, the amount of the sun’s heat reflected by the ice back into space also decreases. This positive-feedback loop amplifies global warming at a rate even faster than previous climate models had predicted. [30] Some studies predict the Arctic could become nearly ice free sometime between 2020-2060. [164] Read More

10	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""It is very simple: where the most milk is consumed, the osteoporosis incidence is highest. Compared to other countries, the most milk is consumed in Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and The Netherlands (300 to 400 kg / cap / year), and osteoporosis incidence in these countries has sky rocketed.  Among those within America that consume less milk, such as the Mexican-Americans and Black Americans, osteoporosis incidence is two-fold lower than in white Americans, which is not due to genetic differences.  Chinese consume very little milk (8 kg / year), and hip-fracture incidence, therefore, is among the lowest in the world; hip-fracture incidence in Chinese women is 6 fold lower than in the US. (The average American consumes 254 kg milk /year).  The less milk consumed, the lower is the osteoporosis rate."""

10	Does a Person's Income Level Affect the Likelihood of Him/Her Receiving the Death Penalty?	"""The next urban legend is that of the threadbare but plucky public defender fighting against all odds against a team of sleek, heavily-funded prosecutors with limitless resources. The reality in the 21st century is startlingly different. There is no doubt that before the landmark 1963 decision in Gideon v. Wainwright appointed counsel was often inadequate. But the past few decades have seen the establishment of public defender systems that in many cases rival some of the best lawyers retained privately. The Chicago Tribune, while slamming the abilities of a number of individual defense counsel in Cook County capital cases in the 1980s, grudgingly admitted that the Cook County Public Defender's Office provided excellent representation for its indigent clients.  Many giant silk-stocking law firms in large cities across America not only provide pro-bono counsel in capital cases, but also offer partnerships to lawyers whose sole job is to promote indigent capital defense. In one recent case in Alabama, a Portland, Oregon law firm spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of lawyer time on a post-conviction appeal for a death row inmate. In Oregon, where I have both prosecuted and defended capital cases, it is common for attorneys to be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the state for their representation of indigent capital clients. And the funding is not limited to legal assistance. Expert witnesses for the defense often total tens of thousands of dollars each, resources far beyond the reach of individual district attorneys who prosecute the same cases.”"
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In Sweden, prostitution is officially acknowledged as a form of male sexual violence against women and children. One of the cornerstones of Swedish policies against prostitution and trafficking in human beings is the focus on the root cause, the recognition that without men's demand for and use of women and girls for sexual exploitation, the global prostitution industry would not be able flourish and expand.   Prostitution is a serious problem that is harmful, in particular, not only to the prostituted woman or child but also to society at large. Therefore, prostituted women and children are seen as victims of male violence who do not risk legal penalties. Instead, they have a right to assistance to escape prostitution."""
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Why is gold good money? Because it possesses all the monetary properties that the market demands: it is divisible, portable, recognizable and, most importantly, scarce – making it a stable store of value. It is all things the market needs good money to be and has been recognized as such throughout history. Gold rose to nearly $1800 an ounce after the Fed’s most recent round of quantitative easing because the people know that gold is money when fiat money fails… Fiat money is not good money because it can be issued without limit and therefore cannot act as a stable store of value. A fiat monetary system gives complete discretion to those who run the printing press, allowing governments to spend money without having to suffer the political consequences of raising taxes. Fiat money benefits those who create it and receive it first, enriching government and its cronies. And the negative effects of fiat money are disguised so that people do not realize that money the Fed creates today is the reason for the busts, rising prices and unemployment, and diminished standard of living tomorrow… As the fiat money pyramid crumbles, gold retains its luster. Rather than being the barbarous relic Keynesians have tried to lead us to believe it is, gold is, as the Bundesbank president put it, ‘a timeless classic.’ The defamation of gold wrought by central banks and governments is because gold exposes the devaluation of fiat currencies and the flawed policies of government.”
10	Does Buddhism Support the Death Penalty?	"""The death penalty fulfills a preventive function, but it is also very clearly a form of revenge. It is an especially severe form of punishment because it is so final. The human life is ended and the executed person is deprived of the opportunity to change, to restore the harm done or compensate for it. Before advocating execution we should consider whether criminals are intrinsically negative and harmful people or whether they will remain perpetually in the same state of mind in which they committed their crime or not. The answer, I believe, is definitely not. However horrible the act they have committed, I believe that everyone has the potential to improve and correct themselves. Therefore, I am optimistic that it remains possible to deter criminal activity, and prevent such harmful consequences of such acts in society, without having to resort to the death penalty."""
10	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""Milk's main selling point is calcium, and milk-drinking is touted for building strong bones in children and preventing osteoporosis in older persons. However, clinical research shows that dairy products have little or no benefit for bones. A 2005 review published in Pediatrics showed that milk consumption does not improve bone integrity in children. Similarly, the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, (1.49 MB) which followed more than 72,000 women for 18 years, showed no protective effect of increased milk consumption on fracture risk. While calcium is important for bone health, studies show that increasing consumption beyond approximately 600 mg per day-amounts that are easily achieved without dairy products or calcium supplements-does not improve bone integrity.  In studies of children and adults, exercise has been found to have a major effect on bone density.  You can decrease your risk of osteoporosis by reducing sodium and animal protein intake in the diet, increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, exercising, and ensuring adequate calcium intake from plant foods such as kale, broccoli, and other leafy green vegetables and beans. You can also use calcium-fortified products such as breakfast cereals and juices, although these products provide more concentrated calcium than is necessary."""

In 1997, as executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, when the issue was before the US Supreme Court, I wrote an editorial favoring it, and told the story of my father, who shot himself rather than endure a protracted death from metastatic cancer of the prostate.  It seems to me that, as with opposition based on whether the physician is 'active,' the argument that physicians should be only 'healers' focuses too much on the physician, and not enough on the patient. When healing is no longer possible, when death is imminent and patients find their suffering unbearable, then the physician’s role should shift from healing to relieving suffering in accord with the patient’s wishes. Still, no physician should have to comply with a request to assist a terminally ill patient to die, just as no patient should be coerced into making such a request.

Committed relationships have intrinsic rewards to both men and women. Most people report that sex within a committed relationship is superior to casual sexual contact. Further, such emotionally bonding sex costs no money. Commitment also offers continuing companionship, emotional security, and an opportunity to pool economic resources and share the responsibility for children. These positive outcomes will always make committed relationships appealing to most people, even those who have access to prostitutes. Further, sex workers can provide committed couples a way to gratify needs for sexual variety without risking the emotional attachments arising from sexual affairs."""
01	Universal Basic Income - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Universal Basic Income (UBI) reduces poverty and income inequality, and improves health. In 1981, Alaska was ranked 30 out of 50 states on income inequality; by 2015, the state had jumped to number two.

[29] Namibia's UBI program, the Basic Income Grant (trialled in 2007-2012), reduced household poverty rates from 76% of residents before the trial started to 37% after one year. Child malnutrition rates also fell from 42% to 17% in six months. [7] Scott Santens, Founding Member of the Economic Security Project, says that a UBI set at $1,000 per adult per month and $300 per child per month would eradicate US poverty entirely.

In addition to the rights all people enjoy, Ms. Schiavo has a statutory right under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) not to be treated differently because of her disability. Obviously, Florida law would not allow a husband to kill a nondisabled wife by starvation and dehydration; killing is not ordinarily considered a private family concern or a matter of choice. It is Ms. Schiavo's disability that makes her killing different in the eyes of the Florida courts...   While we should not assume that disability prejudice tainted the Florida courts, we cannot reasonably assume that it did not.   ...The legislation enabling Ms. Schiavo's parents to sue did not take sides in the so-called culture wars. It did not dictate that Ms. Schiavo be fed. It simply created a procedure whereby the federal courts could decide whether Ms. Schiavo's federally protected rights have been violated.   In the Senate, a key supporter of a federal remedy was Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a progressive Democrat and longtime friend of labor and civil rights, including disability rights. Harkin told reporters, 'There are a lot of people in the shadows, all over this country, who are incapacitated because of a disability'...  I hope against hope that I will never be one of those people in the shadows, that I will always, one way or another, be able to make my wishes known...

"""The Canadian pipeline company TransCanada has proposed a tar sands pipeline that could bring as much as 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) of costly and polluting fuel to the U.S. Gulf Coast. This pipeline, called Keystone XL, will lock the United States into a dependence on hard-to-extract oil and generate a massive expansion of the destructive tar sands oil operations in Canada. In addition to the damage that would be caused by the increased tar sands extraction, the pipeline threatens to pollute freshwater supplies in America's agricultural heartland and increase emissions in already-polluted communities of the Gulf Coast...  The United States should instead implement a comprehensive oil savings plan and reduce oil consumption by increasing fuel efficiency standards, hybrid cars, renewable energy, environmentally sustainable biofuels, and smart growth to meet our transportation needs...  The Alberta tar sands are found under a region of Boreal forest and wetlands similar in size to Florida. The bitumen—or the unrefined product excavated from the tar sands—must either be strip-mined or melted and pumped up after the ground has been heated with steam for several months. Both forms of tar sands extraction fragment and destroy the Boreal forest, killing nesting migratory birds and many other species. Toxic waste from the mining operations is stored in vast man-made dams—called tailings ponds—that already cover sixty-five square miles...

10	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) strongly opposes federal interference in medical decisions, including mandated vaccines. After being fully informed of the risks and benefits of a medical procedure, patients have the right to reject or accept that procedure… Measles is a vexing problem, and more complete, forced vaccination will likely not solve it. Better public health measures—earlier detection, contact tracing, and isolation; a more effective, safer vaccine; or an effective treatment are all needed. Meanwhile, those who choose not to vaccinate now might do so in an outbreak, or they can be isolated. Immunosuppressed patients might choose isolation in any event because vaccinated people can also possibly transmit measles even if not sick themselves. AAPS believes that liberty rights are unalienable. Patients and parents have the right to refuse vaccination, although potentially contagious persons can be restricted in their movements (e.g. as with Ebola), as needed to protect others against a clear and present danger. Unvaccinated persons with no exposure to a disease and no evidence of a disease are not a clear or present danger.”

The employment situation for those without a college education continues to look bleak… The bottom line is that the young and less educated work much less than they used to. These are the workers most likely to compete with DACA recipients armed with their newly issued work permits… One might argue that many DACA recipients were already working, so it's better if they have work permits. But giving work permits to illegal immigrants makes it possible for them to seek employment in almost any job, so the competition with less-educated natives will hit occupations that until now were mostly unaffected.

And then we would face not only the evil ideology of these violent extremists, but an enemy that will have grown accustomed to succeeding and telling free people everywhere what to do. We can persevere in Iraq, or we can withdraw prematurely until they force us to make a stand near home. But make no mistake, they're not going to give up, whether we acquiesce in their immediate demands or not."""

01	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies (RE&EE) are driving significant economic growth in the United States. In 2006, these industries generated 8.5 million new jobs, nearly $970 billion in revenue, more than $100 billion in industry profits, and more than $150 billion in increased federal, state, and local government tax revenues. Additionally, RE&EE provided important stimulus to the beleaguered U.S. manufacturing industry, displaced imported oil, and helped reduce the U.S. trade deficit.  To put this in perspective, RE&EE sales outpaced the combined sales of the three largest U.S. corporations. Total sales for Wal-Mart, Exxon- Mobil, and General Motors in 2006 were $905 billion.  If U.S. policymakers aggressively commit to programs that support the sustained orderly development of RE&EE, the news gets even better. According to research conducted by the American Solar Energy Society (ASES) and Management Information Services, Inc. (MISI), the renewable energy and energy efficiency industry could—in a crash effort—generate up to $4.5 trillion in revenue in the United States and create 40 million new jobs by the year 2030. These 40 million jobs would represent nearly one out of every four jobs in 2030, and many would be jobs that could not easily be outsourced."""

10	Is Vaping with E-Cigarettes Safe?	"E-cigarettes can catch fire or even explode. E-cigarette explosions have led to the loss of body parts (such as an eye, tongue, or tooth), third degree burns, holes in the roof of the mouth, and death. [36] Researchers at George Mason University found that 2,035 people sought emergency room treatment for burn or explosion injuries from e-cigarettes between 2015 and 2017, and believe there were more injuries that went untreated. [36] They also found more than 40 times the number of injuries reported by the FDA between 2009 and 2015. Matthew Rossheim, one of the study's authors, said, ""This study identifies that e-cigarette burn and explosion injuries are not rare, as was recently thought... users and bystanders risk serious bodily injury from unregulated e-cigarette batteries exploding."" [37] Airlines prohibit e-cigarettes in checked baggage due to the possibility of their lithium batteries catching fire. In Jan. 2019, a passenger's e-cigarette overheated and caught fire in the airplane cabin. [38] That same month, a Texas man died when debris from an e-cigarette explosion tore his carotid artery. [39] In 2018, a man in Florida was killed by shrapnel from his e-cigarette exploding. [40] The US Fire Administration (USFA) found 195 reports of e-cigarette explosions and fires including 133 acute injuries, of which 29% were severe. [41] The USFA stated, ""No other consumer product that is typically used so close to the human body contains the lithium-ion battery that is the root cause of the incidents."" [41]"

10	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""An operating nuclear power plant contains a large amount of radioactive material, and an accident that results in the release of this material could cause significant harm to people and the environment. People exposed to high levels of radiation will die or suffer other health consequences within days or weeks. Lower radiation levels can cause cell damage that will eventually lead to cancer, which may not appear for years or even decades. People may need to be permanently evacuated from areas contaminated with radiation. The costs of evacuation and environmental remediation, and those of the loss of usable land, could be enormous. Radioactivity released by a severe accident could lead to the death of tens of thousands of people, injure many thousands of others, contaminate large areas of land, and cost billions of dollars...  [T]he Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has reported four dozen 'abnormal occurrences' to Congress since 1986, and notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of 18 nuclear 'events' since reporting began in 1992.  While no technology can be perfectly safe, nuclear power is an inherently risky technology, and minimizing its risks requires stringent safety standards and practices. The United States has relatively strong safety standards for nuclear power. However, serious safety problems continue to arise because the NRC does not adequately enforce those standards.  Of course, accidents are not the only measure of safety, and the absence of accidents does not necessarily indicate that there are no safety problems. The number of U.S. reactors shut down for a year or longer to address numerous safety problems provides strong evidence of poor safety practices and inadequate NRC enforcement. A weak 'safety culture' within the NRC itself prevents effective oversight. The agency also relies on flawed approaches to assessing risks and inspecting nuclear facilities, and its standards for preventing and mitigating severe accidents are too low."""
10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	"Returning to a gold standard could harm national security by restricting the country’s ability to finance national defense. In times of war, a quick expansion of currency to finance war buildup is sometimes necessary and a gold standard would prevent this from occurring. In order to help finance the Civil War, President Lincoln authorized the printing of $450 million in fiat currency known as ""greenbacks."" [63] The United States financed its involvement in WWII in large part by having the Fed print money (which was not convertible to gold by the public since 1933), selling war bonds, and running large deficits. According to Congressional Research Service (CRS) researchers, ""the means by which the increase in the money supply came about was through the Federal Reserve’s purchase of government bonds.

To that end, the pledge statute undeniably advances a compelling state interest...  [T]he words 'under God' are now as interwoven through the fabric of the pledge of allegiance as the threads of red, white, and blue into the fabric of the flag to which the pledge is recited. As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.

"""Thanks to an abundance of coal, combined with American ingenuity and advanced technologies, we don't have to choose between affordable energy and improved air quality.  That's right - electricity from coal is getting even cleaner everyday.  There has never been an environmental challenge facing the coal-based electricity sector for which technology has not provided the ultimate solution. Even as the use of coal for generating electricity has nearly tripled over the past 30 years, emissions from coal-based power plants have been dramatically reduced through the use of advanced technologies. Today's coal-based electricity generating fleet is 70% cleaner than it was in 1970 (based upon emissions per unit of energy produced)...  The industry has committed itself to even further emissions reductions to eliminate virtually all emissions of pollutants regulated under federal and state clean air laws.  The key environmental question facing the coal-based electricity sector is whether coal can remain a viable part of our energy future even as the U.S. and the world implement programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. Technology experts agree, that we'll meet this challenge, and that coal will remain a low-cost energy option in the future even considering the cost of new technologies to capture and store CO2 - a common greenhouse gas."""

This allows the state to examine the returns for residual voting patterns, programming errors and any other possible malfunctions or polling official errors. Then, after the state completes its review, independent certified public accountants review the materials to discover any exceptions or anomalies.

It is expected to increase by another 1.8° C to 4° C by the year 2100 – a rapid and profound change – should the necessary action not be taken… The principal reason for the mounting thermometer is a century and a half of industrialization: the burning of ever-greater quantities of oil, gasoline, and coal, the cutting of forests, and the practice of certain farming methods. These activities have increased the amount of ‘greenhouse gases’ in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Such gases occur naturally – they are critical for life on earth, they keep some of the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space, and without them the world would be a cold and barren place. But in augmented and increasing quantities, they are pushing the global temperature to artificially high levels and altering the climate. Eleven of the last 12 years are the warmest on record… The current warming trend is expected to cause extinctions. Numerous plant and animal species, already weakened by pollution and loss of habitat, are not expected to survive the next 100 years. Human beings, while not threatened in this way, are likely to face mounting difficulties. Recent severe storms, floods and droughts, for example, appear to show that computer models predicting more frequent ‘extreme weather events’ are on target.”

Cutting-edge technology has forged new frontiers with the use of lasers, fiber optics, microchips, genomics, computer-based drug design, and digital imaging, to name a few… These methods have contributed to a technological revolution in biomedical research and rendered the reliance on animals outdated. Scientists have only just begun to tap the potential of these new technologies. Their full potential can never be realized while dependence on animal models persists. Reliance on animals continues, not because it is effective, but due to inertia, lack of training, vested financial interests and adherence to outdated traditions… If we took a fraction of the resources currently devoted to animal experiments and put those towards developing and expanding non-animal methods, we could vastly reduce the use of animals immediately and pave way for the day that they are no longer used at all.”

In 2014, the fine for not carrying insurance is the higher of $95 per person or 1.0 percent of taxable income. In 2015, the fine is the higher of $325 per person, or 2.0 percent of taxable income. In 2016, it's $695 per person or 2.5 percent of taxable income. You're liable for up to 2 additional dependents, fine-wise...  Section 1501(g)(2) of the Affordable Care Act specifies that the IRS cannot subject taxpayers to 'any criminal prosecution or penalty' for refusing to pay the mandate fine. Also, in contrast to normal tax levies, the IRS cannot 'file notice of lien with respect to any property of a taxpayer by reason of any failure to pay the penalty imposed by this section.'  Basically, the only thing the IRS can do to make you pay the mandate fine is to take it out of your withholding, or withhold it from your tax refund, if you're due one."""

01	Does Christianity Support the Death Penalty?	"""The rejection of capital punishment is not to be dignified as a 'higher Christian way' that enthrones the ethics of Jesus. The argument that Jesus as the incarnation of divine love cancels the appropriateness of capital punishment in the New Testament era has little to commend it. Nowhere does the Bible repudiate capital punishment for premeditated murder; not only is the death penalty for deliberate killing of a fellow human being permitted, but it is approved and encouraged, and for any government that attaches at least as much value to the life of an innocent victim as to a deliberate murderer, it is ethically imperative."""

Despite its status as an unapproved new drug, there has been considerable interest in its use for the treatment of a number of conditions, including glaucoma, AIDS wasting, neuropathic pain, treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, and chemotherapy-induced nausea… Having access to a drug or medical treatment, without knowing how to use it or even if it is effective, does not benefit anyone. Simply having access, without having safety, efficacy, and adequate use information does not help patients. FDA has and will continue to use its IND and other expanded access programs to provide patients freedom to choose investigational medical treatments while reasonably ensuring safety, informed choice, and systematic data collection that allows us to review drug applications. FDA will continue to be receptive to sound, scientifically based research into the medicinal uses of botanical marijuana and other cannabinoids.”

01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Our position on the question 'Can alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuels?' is clear.   Renewable energy, can and indeed must replace both fossil fuel and nuclear power as quickly as possible if the world is to avoid the catastrophic effects of runaway climate change. Page 12 of the summary report of the 2nd edition of the Energy Revolution contains this statement: 'The amount of energy that can be accessed with current technologies supplies a total of 5.9 times the global demand for energy.' The remainder of the report spells out how we believe the world can set off down the path to a clean energy future, within the current political and economic constraints."""
01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""That day will come: the life-changing moment when renewable energy—wind, solar, geothermal and others still in development—replace fossil fuels as the principal source of world energy…   The transition to renewables will be hastened by dramatic improvements in the pricing and performance of such systems. Due to steady increases in the efficiency of wind and solar systems, coupled with the savings achieved through large-scale manufacture, the price of renewables is falling globally…  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy will not occur overnight, and it will not escape recurring setbacks. Nevertheless, renewables are likely to replace fossil fuels as the dominant source of electrical power well before mid-century as well as make giant strides in other areas such as transportation."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""So is the solar revolution finally here? Not quite. Even after a decade of rampant growth solar energy still barely moves the needle in the U.S. energy mix. In fact, solar merely equals the amount of electricity that the nation generates by burning natural gas captured from landfills…  The biggest sources are the old standbys. Oil still reigns supreme at 36 quadrillion Btu, natural gas at 26 quads, nuclear 8. Hydropower and biomass bring up the rear at 2.6 and 2.7 quads. Wind is just 1.5 quads. And coal — the great carbon-belching demon of the global energy mix — its contribution is 19 quads. That’s nearly 8 times all the nation's wind and solar generation combined…  For all the talk of 'grid parity' the simple reality is that even combined with far more power generation from natural gas, renewable alternatives will need decades to push out coal. And the irony will be that as demand for coal lessens, it will become cheaper and cheaper, making it even more attractive for the coal-burning power plants that survive the coming cull…  Coal has gotten immensely cleaner over the past generation. And new and better ways will be found to extract energy from coal without sending its dangerous byproducts into the environment. It's scalable and reliable in ways that renewable energy sources simply aren't. In short, unless we’re willing to put up with blackouts that freeze grandma in the winter and melt her in the summer, coal will remain a mainstay of U.S. power generation for decades to come."""
01	Should Marijuana Be Reclassified as a Schedule II or III Drug?	think we shouldn’t restrict research into any drugs looking for a potential health benefit. I think right now with marijuana being Schedule I, it’s very hard to do research. So one of the good aspects is changing to Schedule II so we can actually do more research on what might help people. You know we have a lot of terminal patients who want the right to try certain medications. We also have a lot of patients who may not necessarily be terminal but are very sick and may have an incurable disease, and they do get some benefit from marijuana. People with nausea, people with wasting [syndrome], people with seizures. The bottom line is… it’s kind of crazy that OxyContin is Schedule II and marijuana is Schedule I.

[10] Since AmeriCorps was founded in 1993, over 800,000 participants have completed more than one billion service hours. [11] Applications already outpace funding and capacity, meaning that forcing more people to participate would be difficult. [12] There are 15 qualified would-be volunteers for every available AmeriCorps spot. [13] Conscripting people into the military would make the armed forces less efficient. Michael Lind, JD co-founder and fellow at the New America Foundation, stated, ""Most members of the military are satisfied with our professional soldiers and do not want to baby-sit teenagers who will leave the military after six months or two years of unsought, compulsory training."" [14] More than 24 million of the 34 million Americans between ages 17 and 24 - a whopping 71% - would be ineligible to serve in the military because of disqualifying factors such as poor health, felony convictions, and tattoos.

01	Binge-Watching - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Binge-watching leads to beneficial social connections. Binge-watching creates a sense of community around a show, something experts call a ""shared cultural space.” This common ground allows viewers to discuss and enjoy the show with everyone from a coworker to the stranger in line at the grocery store. Instead of feeling lonely or isolated, this shared space makes it easier to relate to other people and share personal perspectives. [6] [7] [8] Romantic relationships can also be strengthened by binge-watching together because it creates a shared interest, is a fun activity, can be a conversation starter, and is an easy way to share time together. Binge-watching can also be a type of couples therapy for troubles such as illness or difficult family relationships. If couples see fictional couples having the same problems, they may be able to better understand and deal with the issues in real life. [9] A study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that binge-watching can help long-distance relationships by replacing shared activities like going to dinner together and having mutual friends. Sharing the pretend world of the shows creates the mutual friendships and experiences needed to strengthen long-distance relationships. [10]"
10	Does the ACLU Undermine the War on Terror?	The organization does, however, insist that government actions taken to protect Americans from terrorism be consistent with our Constitution and the rule of law. Acts of terrorism are, as the term itself indicates, intended to terrorize. Unfortunately, when people become fearful, they sometimes endorse measures that are ultimately self-defeating; the arrest of ‘suspicious’ people or the conduct of intrusive searches without probable cause, profiling individuals from certain ethnic groups based simply upon the way they look, ‘interrogation’ methods that are really torture outlawed by the Geneva conventions, and similar practices that are inconsistent with the 4th Amendment and with constitutional due process guarantees. Research confirms that these panicky measures ultimately make Americans less safe. Not only do they encourage lawless behavior by some law enforcement officials, but they deepen divisions within the American population. Unconstitutional tactics create resentment and discourage co-operation with the authorities, and actually hinder the search for terrorists. Worse, as members of terrorist cells operating in hostile nations learn of American behaviors inconsistent with our own rules (Abu Ghraib comes to mind), they use those behaviors as centerpieces of their propaganda, as tools to recruit more terrorists, and as an excuse to mistreat Americans they capture.”
10	Is Golf a Sport?	Athleticism does not correlate with performance when it comes to golf. The fact that golfers are able to be competitive professionally so far past the age of peak athleticism -- age 26 according to a June 2011 peer-reviewed study -- shows that golf is not a sport. For example, Tom Watson nearly won one of the biggest tournaments in professional golf, the British Open, at age 59 in 2009. Jack Nicklaus won 11 of his 18 majors after turning 30.

Y Combinator, a startup incubator, is going to run a UBI trial in Oakland, California, providing individual participants with $1,000-$2,000 a month. [22] A $2,000 a month per head of household UBI would cost an estimated $2.275 trillion annually, says Marc Joffe, MBA, MPA, Director of Policy Research at the California Policy Center. [23] Some of this cost could be offset by eliminating federal, state, and local assistance programs; however, by Joffe's calculation, ""these offsets total only $810 billion... [leaving] a net budgetary cost of over $1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program."" [23] The UBI trial in Finland provides participants with €560 ($673 USD) a month for two years. [21] lkka Kaukoranta, MS, Chief Economist of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), says that Finland's UBI model is ""impossibly expensive, since it would increase the government deficit by about 5 percent [of GDP]."" [20] In a Sep. 14, 2016 parliamentary debate, UK Minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, rejected the idea of UBI, saying that estimated implementation costs ranging from £8.2 billion - £160 billion ($10.8 billion - $211 billion USD) are ""clearly unaffordable."" [38] Economist John Kay, Research Fellow at the University of Oxford, studied proposed UBI levels in Finland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and concluded that, in all of these countries, UBI at a level which can guarantee an acceptable standard of living is ""impossibly expensive...

01	Can Sexual Orientation Be Successfully Changed?	the 31 studies we reviewed, we found a total of 45 persons who experienced a full sexual orientation shift. Some studies also provided evidence that some homosexual persons are able to ‘acquire’ heterosexual behaviour (86 persons). By this we mean that they gained the ability to interact sexually in satisfying ways with someone of the opposite sex. And we found evidence for partial shifts in sexual orientation (287 persons). In a partial shift, an exclusively homosexual person acquires heterosexual attractions and desires, but with some degree of homosexuality remaining… Our research has shown the statement ‘homosexuals can’t change’ to be a generalization. Various sources provide evidence for a partial or full shift in sexual orientation. Such evidence does not mean that every homosexual person should change. It does not mean that everyone can change. It does not mean that change is easy. It does mean that, at least for some people, change of sexual orientation is possible.”
10	Does Illegal Immigration Pose a Terrorist Threat to the United States?	"""Illegal immigrants are not terrorists.

10	Did Obamacare Allow Everyone to Keep Their Insurance Coverage? - NO	"""Though not everybody who liked their health plan could keep it as President Obama once famously said, there were still just a small percentage of Americans who had their policies cancelled last year despite some overhyped predictions. About 2.2% of Americans who purchased coverage on their own, or 400,000 people, had individual policies cancelled, according a new analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute. And just 0.3% of Americans with coverage through their employer, or 500,000 people, had their health insurance policies cancelled in 2014, the Institute said. Authors of the issue brief, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said there was no evidence of a significant number of policy cancellations in either the self-insured or small group markets...  Policies were generally cancelled because these plans didn't comply with the Affordable Care Act's requirements that health plans sold on government exchanges have ten essential health benefits. Plans also had to comply with other consumer protections such as 'prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions and premiums based on health status or sex.'  Though there were many reports that millions received cancellation notices, government policy changes blunted the impact of people actually having their policy cancelled."""

The best part of this plan is that after the numbers are adjusted to reflect the player's non-using seasons, the stats of Bonds and Clemens would still be good enough to earn them their rightful place in the Hall of Fame. Face it, had neither player ever touched a steroid, and retired in a normal time frame, each would already be in the Hall. That's how it should be."""
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“People sometimes argue in favor of a universal human right to health care by saying that health care is different from all other human goods or products. It is supposedly an important precondition of life itself. This is wrong: There are several other, much more important preconditions of human existence, such as food, shelter and clothing. Everyone agrees that hunger is a bad thing (as is overeating), but few suppose there is a right to a healthy, balanced diet, or that if there was, the federal government would be the best at providing and distributing it to each and every American… The government-run health-care system—which in the U.K. is believed to be the necessary institutional corollary to an inalienable right to health care—has pauperized the entire population… Universality is closely allied as an ideal, ideologically, to that of equality. But equality is not desirable in itself. To provide everyone with the same bad quality of care would satisfy the demand for equality… [T]he universality of government health care in pursuance of the abstract right to it in Britain has not ensured equality. After 60 years of universal health care, free at the point of usage and funded by taxation, inequalities between the richest and poorest sections of the population have not been reduced. But Britain does have the dirtiest, most broken-down hospitals in Europe. There is no right to health care—any more than there is a right to chicken Kiev every second Thursday of the month.”

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“[H]uman activities are influencing the climate. As discussed in the following chapters, scientific evidence that the Earth is warming is now overwhelming. There is also a multitude of evidence that this warming results primarily from human activities, especially burning fossil fuels and other activities that release heat-trapping greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Projections of future climate change indicate that Earth will continue to warm unless significant and sustained actions are taken to limit emissions of GHGs. These increases in temperature and GHG concentrations are driving a multitude of related and interacting changes in the Earth system, including decreases in the amounts of ice stored in mountain glaciers and Polar Regions, increases in sea level, changes in ocean chemistry, and changes in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, precipitation events, and droughts. These changes in turn pose significant risks to both human and ecological systems.”
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Indeed, it is often said that the need for health care constitutes a right. President Clinton campaigned with the slogan, ‘Health care should be a right, not a privilege.’ I can state my own point in a sentence: there is no such right… The idea that people have a right to health care is inimical to our genuine liberties. The policies that flow from that idea are harmful to the interests of doctors and patients alike… [A] political system that tries to implement a right to health care will necessarily involve: forced transfers of wealth to pay for programs, loss of freedom for health care providers, higher prices and more restricted access by all consumers, a trend toward egalitarianism, and the collectivization of health care. These consequences are not accidental. They follow necessarily from the nature of the alleged right.”

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Without tenure, a 30-year teacher who has proven himself able under six school administrations can be fired under the seventh simply due to a conflict in teaching styles. Without tenure, the most experienced and proven educator — someone who has put in years on a school district pay scale — could be fired simply to cut costs in order to hire a newer, unproven teacher… Without tenure, a teacher would be less likely to try a new book or lesson that strayed from the district vision even if that vision was flawed, or even if that supplemental material was exactly what that teacher needed to reach the kids in her classroom. Without tenure, we could not use criticism to improve our profession. Without tenure, our vulnerability might influence our choices, allowing our fear of standardized test scores to drive our curriculum, rather then adding the critical-thinking skills into our lessons that we know our students truly need. Without tenure, a teacher could not fight for a student’s rights, raising his voicing against his own school administration or district. Tenure is not so much a perk as a shield that permits us to teach through the ebb and flow of trends and fads brought in ofttimes by nomadic administrators. It gives us the ability to have an unthreatened voice to stand up against the grain. It allows us to retain our positions through our pregnancies, illness, and mourning, to stand up against lawyers pitted against us by litigious-eyed parents, or by the occasional student with lying on her tongue.”

[51] The American Medical Association reports that private health insurance plans spend 11.7% of premiums on administrative costs vs. 6.3% spent by public health programs. [52] According to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), Canada and the United Kingdom, two countries that provide universal health coverage, spend 47% and 42% of what the United States did per capita in 2017.

01	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""[N]ot only is this law [Obamacare] not beyond rescue, it doesn't need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working. And to understand whether it's working...  Young adults 26 and under now can get coverage on their parents' policies, and three million have. Preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage. There's portability of insurance coverage, no lifetime caps, community rating, which means if you're in a small business, one person gets very sick or their family member does, it doesn't raise the rates for everybody. No lifetime caps on coverage, lots of stuff, and in some ways very importantly, no copays, no deductibles for preventive care that's evidence based...  Importantly, cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically. That is, the increase per year is just an average of 1.1 percent in the past three years, 2010 to 2012. So in summary, before this year, before anything that's been controversial in the news happened, there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of Obamacare."""

10	Is Obamacare Decreasing the Federal Deficit? - DEBATED	"""Myth: The health care law reduces the deficit.   It is true the CBO has officially 'scored' the health care bill as costing $950 billion and warns that repealing it would add $230 billion to the deficit. However, those numbers do not tell the whole story, nor do they reveal the bill's true cost.  For example, CBO estimates do not include roughly $115 billion in implementation costs, such as the cost of hiring new IRS agents to enforce the bill's individual mandate.  The CBO estimate also assumes Congress will not repeal an anticipated 23 percent reduction in Medicare spending (the so-called 'doc-fix'). But Congress already has postponed those cuts by a year, and no one seriously expects them to remain intact.  A true accounting of all the bill's costs suggests that repeal could actually reduce the budget deficit by as much as $700 billion over 10 years."""
10	Should States Issue Driver’s Licenses to Immigrants in the United States Illegally?	"""In an increasingly security-conscious America, access to driver's licenses by people in the country illegally poses serious risks and undermines U.S. immigration law. Proponents of issuing driver’s licenses to illegal aliens have argued that it would improve national security and road safety. The security argument is spurious, because illegal aliens often use aliases and phony documents, so the alien’s identity and residence is not established as a result of the driver’s license process...  The argument about road safety relies on a faulty assumption that if illegal aliens are legally licensed to drive, they will all have accident insurance. But even if a state requires automobile insurance as a condition of getting a license, that does not keep an illegal alien from canceling the policy the next day. Illegal aliens generally are working in low-wage jobs and have difficulty affording insurance, and their cars are frequently older and more accident-prone.  Additionally, illegal aliens often are not able to read road alerts in English. In many of the countries from which illegal aliens come, it is standard practice for motorists involved in accidents to flee the scene. The combination of these factors adds up to the probability that, if more illegal aliens were encouraged to drive by issuing them driver’s licenses, it would lead to more accidents caused by uninsured motorists and many would be hit and run."""
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“[R]ecreational weed comes with health, safety and social costs that make legalizing marijuana a dangerous proposal for Nevadans… Legalizing weed would jeopardize the health of countless Nevadans, expose more people to drug abuse and addiction, put excessive stress on the state’s health-care facilities and do little to relieve the state’s bloated prison population. The pro-pot lobby hails marijuana as relatively harmless. But that’s misleading, at best. Marijuana contains nearly 500 dangerous chemicals when inhaled or ingested, including about five times more tars and other cancer-causing agents than tobacco smoke. Cancer, respiratory diseases, mental illness, birth defects, reproductive problems and irreversible brain damage are all linked to marijuana use. And no matter how much pot enthusiasts argue otherwise, marijuana is both addictive — one in 10 people who try pot will become hooked on it — and a gateway to more deadly drugs that kill more than 45,000 Americans a year.”

The race of defendants executed in the U.S. since 1976 is 56 percent white; 35 percent black; 7 percent Hispanic; 2 percent other.  The reason for the discrepancy in the execution rate between blacks and whites is that juries deciding whether to impose the death penalty have concluded in more cases involving black defendants that there were extenuating circumstances militating in favor of a lesser penalty...

01	Has Obamacare Worsened the Primary Care Physician Shortage? - DEBATED	"""Young people who do pursue medicine are gravitating to specialty medicine – neurology, gastroenterology, radiology, orthopedics, etc. They bypass primary care medicine because of patient overload, existing care guidelines and poor reimbursement rates...

The new health care law was designed to connect patients with providers. Yet nearly one in five Americans live in regions where primary care physician shortages are significant. Consumers are calling multiple providers in their networks only to be told selected physicians aren't taking new patients. Despite efforts in many states to mandate insurance companies to increase the number of doctors and hospitals in-network, most Obamacare plans continue to have restricted networks and offer fewer doctors than before the health care overhaul.

10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""Undocumented immigrants contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $11.64 billion a year. Contributions range from almost $2.2 million in Montana with an estimated undocumented population of 4,000 to more than $3.1 billion in California, home to more than 3 million undocumented immigrants.   Undocumented immigrants nationwide pay on average an estimated 8 percent of their incomes in state and local taxes (this is their effective state and local tax rate). To put this in perspective, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay an average nationwide effective tax rate of just 5.4 percent.   Granting legal status to all undocumented immigrants in the United States as part of a comprehensive immigration reform and allowing them to work legally would increase their state and local tax contributions by an estimated $2.1 billion a year. Their nationwide effective state and local tax rate would increase to 8.6 percent.   The state and local tax contributions of the undocumented immigrants who could be directly impacted by President Obama's 2012 and 2014 executive actions would increase by an estimated $805 million a year once fully in place. The effective state and local tax rate for this population would increase from 8.1 to 8.6 percent. State and local revenue gains from the executive actions are smaller than gains from granting legal status to all undocumented immigrants because the actions (if upheld) would only affect around 46 percent of the undocumented population and the actions do not grant a full pathway to lawful permanent residence or citizenship."""

In some states, it’s up to county officials to decide who gets to carry a gun inside his or her coat. Here’s reality: A criminal or disturbed person will carry a concealed weapon, licensed or not. Under the universal background check system, anyone walking into a state office seeking a concealed carry permit has already been screened; there’s no reason to deny that person a license if he or she meets the additional requirements.”

The cap should be imposed 'upstream,' that is, on fossil fuels at the point of extraction, processing, or distribution, not at the point of combustion. The system should set a trajectory of caps over time that begin modestly and gradually become more stringent, establishing a long-run price signal to encourage investment in emission-reducing technology.

01	Is There Widespread Systemic Use of Banned Performance-Enhancing Drugs by Olympic Athletes?	"""According to the IOC [International Olympic Committee] director general, François Carrard, the fact that only eight athletes out of 11,000 Olympic competitors tested positive is proof that 'the war on doping is being won.' But the argument that the small number of athletes testing positive is indicative of the low prevalence of doping is nonsense.  The number of positive tests is an extremely poor indicator of the prevalence of doping...There is general recognition among those involved in elite level sport that those testing positive represent only the tip of the iceberg. It is impossible to estimate precisely how big that iceberg is, but it is clearly very large.  While some sports, for example badminton and handball, appear to be relatively drug-free, the recent history of sports such as cycling, weightlifting and, increasingly, track and field and swimming is synonymous with doping. By 1968 an estimated one-third of the U.S. track and field team used steroids in their preparation for the Mexico Olympics. There is no evidence that drug use has since declined...  Firstly, drug-using athletes often beat tests because they have access to specialized medical advice from sports physicians...Secondly, there is evidence of collusion between dope-using athletes and senior officials. Positive tests have been 'lost' at several Olympics. Dr. Wade Exum, former chief doping officer for the U.S. Olympic Committee, recently claimed positive tests on American athletes were concealed, while Robert Voy, formerly the committee's chief medical officer, claimed in a sworn affidavit that the committee routinely covered up positive tests.

There remain holdouts who complain that the ACA is an infringement of 'freedom.' That's true only under a bizarro-world definition of 'freedom.' Before the ACA, Americans were 'free' to be locked into jobs they detested; to be abused, ripped off or rejected outright by insurance companies; and to suffer medical conditions without treatment.

There is more to it than the mere physical act of imprisonment, much more. The more than 3,000 life without parole prisoners in this state [California] also enter a rough justice kind of limbo existence. We are condemned to serve out our lives in the worst (maximum security) prisons, which otherwise are specifically designed to be punitive. This means, in practice, rehabilitative and restorative type programs, the kind of programs that can bring healing and meaning to a prisoner's life, are generally not available to us. The thinking goes that since we will never get out of prison there is no point in expending scarce resources on dead men walking…  I agree that state-sanctioned execution is morally repugnant. I do not agree that a life devoid of any possibility of restoration is a reasonable or humane alternative. It simply is not. A death penalty by any other name is as cruel, as violent, and as wrong...

The presence of white blood cells does not indicate a sick animal; some white blood cells are normal. Only when we see high levels of white blood cells does it become an issue. This is true of organic milk and conventional milk. Dairy farmers closely monitor white blood cell count and refer to it as Somatic Cell Count (SCC).   SCC is the main indicator of milk quality in the dairy industry, and farmers work hard to keep a low SCC... While the legal SCC limit in the U.S. is 750,000, most dairy co-ops and creameries require a SCC below 400,000. Because dairy farmers are financially rewarded for low herd SCC and penalized for high ones, most strive to have a SCC below 200,000.

01	Should Bottled Water Be Banned? - Top 4 Pros and Cons	Banning bottled water is good for your health. Bottled water is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and requires weekly testing; tap water is more stringently regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency through multiple daily tests. [9] A study by Orb Media and the State University of New York found bottled water samples contained nearly twice as many pieces of micro-plastic per liter (10.4) than the tap water samples (4.45) with 93% of bottles showing some sign of micro-plastic contamination. [10][11] A study published in Environmental Science & Technology found that the chemical antimony (Sb) can leach from plastic PET bottles into the water within. [13] After six months storage at room temperature antimony (Sb) concentrations increased on average 90% in 48 brands of water from 11 countries. [13] Exposure to antimony (Sb) can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, higher blood cholesterol, and low blood sugar. [12] Banning bottled water would reduce the number of plastic bottles manufactured – a process that emits harmful chemicals. Studies indicate that communities living close to PET factories suffer from increased levels of chronic illness and birth defects. [21] In Corpus Christi, TX, where the US' largest PET factory is located, birth defects are 84% higher than the state average. [21]

And the other reason is, I think that by next year we should have built up, and I think we're well on our way to building up, the Iraqi forces to a point where they can take over more of the burden, both the military and police forces."""
10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	research shows that marijuana has detrimental effects on the brain, lungs, heart and fertility.

01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Children who see a lot of violence are more likely to view violence as an effective way of settling conflicts. Children exposed to violence are more likely to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior. Viewing violence can lead to emotional desensitization towards violence in real life. It can decrease the likelihood that one will take action on behalf of a victim when violence occurs. Entertainment violence feeds a perception that the world is a violent and mean place. Viewing violence increases fear of becoming a victim of violence, with a resultant increase in self-protective behaviors and a mistrust of others. Viewing violence may lead to real life violence. Children exposed to violent programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and aggressive behavior later in life than children who are not so exposed. Although less research has been done on the impact of violent interactive entertainment (video games and other interactive media) on young people, preliminary studies indicate that the negative impact may be significantly more severe than that wrought by television, movies, or music.”
01	Is the ACLU against Christmas or Other Religious Holidays?	is coming and so is the parade of horribles – the ACLU, Freedom From Religion, and Americans United For Separation of Church and State. If these organizations had their way, nativity scenes, Christian Christmas carols, and religious symbols would be swept from the public square… The ACLU has all too often stated its case to the media by mailing a demand letter or by placing a threatening phone call to government officials. This intimidation tactic has been successful. Striking fear into the hearts of government officials has proven an effective weapon to remove nativity scenes and to silence Christmas pageants. The fact of the matter remains that the ACLU is wrong, and it is time we let our elected officials know the truth.”

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“It is hard to find a rational justification that explains the ease with which people can buy firearms, including assault rifles, in spite of prior criminal backgrounds, drug use, histories of domestic violence and mental illness, or direct contact with extremists – both domestic and foreign. How many more mass killings of school-children, of co-workers, of African-American churchgoers — how many more individual shootings of talented musicians like Christina Grimmie, or politicians like Gabrielle Giffords, will it take before the United States adopts robust gun regulation? Why should any civilian anywhere be able to acquire an assault rifle or other high-powered weapons designed to kill lots of people? Irresponsible pro-gun propaganda suggests that firearms make society safer, when all evidence points to the contrary. The ready availability of guns leaves little space between murderous impulses and actions that result in death. The journey between hate-filled beliefs and violent hate crimes is accelerated. Society — in particular its most vulnerable communities and minorities who are already facing widespread prejudice — pay a high price for the failure to stand up to the lobbyists and take the necessary measures to protect people from gun violence. Examples from many countries clearly show that a legal framework to control the acquisition and use of firearms has led to a dramatic reduction in violent crime.”

Although there have been critiques of these regimes and how they operate, there's now a body of reputable empirical evidence that concludes they’re generally operating as designed and within the scope of relevant laws.   So concerns about widespread abuse of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide laws appear to be unfounded…   Paying attention to the interests of the elderly and disabled people actually ensures we use appropriate eligibility criteria in the legislation. And that those criteria are supported by robust procedural safeguards as well as effective and independent oversight mechanisms."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The ACLU supports the decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of prostitution. The ACLU also condemns the abuse of vagrancy or loitering laws or licensing or regulatory schemes to harass and arrest those who may be engaged in solicitation for prostitution. While there are both male and female prostitutes, laws against prostitution most frequently refer to, or are applied to woman. Despite the statutory stress on female prostitution, the ACLU's policy is applicable to prostitutes of both sexes...   Such laws have traditionally represented one of the most direct forms of discrimination against women. The woman who engage in prostitution is punished criminally and stigmatized socially while her male customer, either by the explicit design of the statute or through a pattern of discriminatory enforcement is left unscathed.  Prostitution laws are also a violation of the right of individual privacy because they impose penal sanctions for the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. Whether a person chooses to engage in sexual activity for purposes of recreation, or in exchange for something of value, is a matter of individual choice, not for governmental interference. Police use of entrapment techniques to enforce laws against this essentially private activity is reprehensible. Similarly, the use of loitering and vagrancy laws to punish prostitutes for their status or to make arrests on the basis of reputation and appearance, is contrary to civilized notions of due process of law.   Since the ACLU policy is that prostitution should not be made criminal, solicitation for prostitution is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  The ACLU reaffirms its policy favoring removal of criminal penalties for prostitution and in support of total sexual freedom among consenting adults in private."""

Betsy DeVos, US Secretary of Education, stated, ""Empirical evidence finds school-choice programs lead to more integrated schools than their public-school counterparts."" [15] School vouchers allow lower-income parents to avoid sending a child to a bad school, a school overwhelmed with gang violence, or a school that lacks racial diversity. A study of Louisiana's voucher program found that the program reduced racial segregation, a feat in a state with 34 school districts under federal desegregation orders. [6] Many families use vouchers to avoid the ""school-to-prison pipeline,"" the phenomenon in which children of color are poorly educated, subjected to racist treatment, and treated like criminals in schools often ruled by gangs. [17] These children deserve better, and vouchers empower students to overcome racial and other disparities in their communities."
10	Is Obamacare Leading to a Decline in Employment-Based Health Insurance? - DEBATED	"""Critics frequently characterize the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a threat to the survival of employer-sponsored insurance. The Medicaid expansion and Marketplace subsidies could adversely affect employers' incentives to offer health insurance and workers' incentives to take up such offers. This article takes advantage of timely data from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey for June 2013 through September 2014 to examine, from the perspective of workers, early changes in offer, take-up, and coverage rates for employer-sponsored insurance under the ACA. We found no evidence that any of these rates have declined under the ACA. They have, in fact, remained constant: around 82 percent, 86 percent, and 71 percent, respectively, for all workers and around 63 percent, 71 percent, and 45 percent, respectively, for low-income workers. To date, the ACA has had no effect on employer coverage. Economic incentives for workers to obtain coverage from employers remain strong."""

[25] A UBI allows working parents to reduce their working hours in order to spend more time with their children or help with household chores. [26][27] Reviewing the UBI trial in India (2013-2014), SEWA Bharat (an organization related to women's employment) and UNICEF (a children's rights organization) concluded that ""women's empowerment was one of the more important outcomes of this experiment,"" noting that women receiving a UBI participated more in household decision making, and benefited from improved access to food, healthcare, and education. [14] The Basic Income Grant Coalition trial UBI in Namibia (2007-2012) found that UBI ""reduced the dependency of women on men for their survival"" and reduced the pressure to engage in transactional sex. [7] Mincome, the Canadian UBI trial in the mid-1970s, found that emergency room visits as a result of domestic violence reduced during the period of the trial. [28]"
10	Has Legalizing Medical Marijuana Led to Increased Drug Abuse among Children and Adolescents?	fear [that medical marijuana laws will increase teen use of marijuana], raised in 1996, when California passed the first effective medical-marijuana law, has not come true.

10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	The “parsonage exemption” on ministers’ homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers’ expense. The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. [61] In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, [63] and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment.

10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“In the name of science or medicine, animals are subjected to countless invasive, frightening and sometimes very painful procedures. We all want to see cures for terrible diseases such as Parkinson’s (which afflicted my mother), cancer (to which I lost my husband), multiple sclerosis and so on, but regardless of how much or how little these experiments benefit human health, should we exploit animals in this way? Animal experimenters often justify such research by claiming the existence in humans of some morally relevant characteristics, such as intelligence, language, or consciousness, that are supposedly absent in other species. But we are fast discovering a great deal about high levels of intelligence in many animal species, and too about animal consciousness, emotions and sensitivity to pain… We need a new mindset for the 21st century. Most experimenters, while acknowledging that animals are sentient and sometimes sapient beings, say that some will always have to be used but they will use as few and treat them as well as possible. Instead, let us admit that the practice is morally and ethically unacceptable. We need to move on. The amazing human brain has already discovered astonishingly innovative ways of improving medical research by replacing animals. Let science direct its collectively awesome intellect toward finding alternatives to the use of live animals in all procedures—as soon as possible. This should be supported by the scientific establishment and vastly increased funding should be found for it. It should be a goal for all civilised societies.”

Extending this work, Santosh Kesari, chief of neuro-oncology at the University of California, San Diego, two of Canada’s top physician-epidemiologists, Antony B. Miller and Colin Soskolne, and I have just published a technical report concluding that more recent studies indicate that cell phone radiation constitutes a ‘probable human carcinogen’… [B]rain cancer is hardly the only health matter of concern when it comes to cell phones and other devices.

10	Is There a Moral Difference between Passive and Active Euthanasia?	"""The distinction between active and passive euthanasia is thought to be crucial for medical ethics... However, a strong case can be made against this doctrine...   If one simply withholds treatment, it may take the patient longer to die, and so he may suffer more than he would if more direct action were taken and a lethal injection given. This fact provides strong reason for thinking that, once the initial decision not to prolong his agony has been made active euthanasia is actually preferable to passive euthanasia, rather than the reverse. To say otherwise is to endorse the option that leads to more suffering rather than less, and is contrary to the humanitarian impulse that prompts the decision not to prolong his life in the first place.   It is not exactly correct to say that in passive euthanasia the doctor does nothing, for he does do one thing that is very important: he lets the patient die. 'Letting someone die' is certainly different, in some respects, from other types of action - mainly in that it is a kind of action that one may perform by way of not performing certain other actions. For example, one may let a patient die by way of not giving medication, just as one may insult someone by way of not shaking his hand. But for any purpose of moral assessment, it is a type of action nonetheless. The decision to let a patient die is subject to moral appraisal in the same way that decision to kill him would be subject to moral appraisal. """

01	Does the US Congress Have Authority to Legislate Felon Enfranchisement in Federal Elections?	"""There are three potential constitutional bases for Congress's authority to enfranchise non-incarcerated offenders for federal elections:   -Congress's supervisory power over federal elections, rooted in Article 1, Sec. 4;  -Congress's enforcement power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment; and  -Congress's enforcement power under Section Two of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Under its enforcement powers, Congress can conclude that enfranchisement of non-incarcerated offenders is appropriate to ensure that racial discrimination does not taint federal elections.  Congress could also enfranchise non-incarcerated offenders under its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power based on its determination that laws disenfranchising non-incarcerated felons are arbitrary and irrational."""

In such an environment, this Court should not sanction a Pledge of Allegiance that separates Americans into the preferred and the marginalized...  In other words, it is because ours is a nation of individuals under God, or more accurately, it is because ours is a nation grounded in each individual's relationship with the Divine (however conceived by conscience), that a policy requiring teachers to lead school children in the recitation of a Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words 'under God,' is unconstitutional."""

01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“For the past 20 years, the U.S. has maintained a Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21 (MLDA21), with little public debate about the wisdom of this policy… In our recently completed research, we show that the MLDA21 has little or no life-saving effect. Our research compares traffic fatality rates in states before and after they changed their MLDA from 18 to 21. In contrast to all earlier work, however, we examined separately the impact in states that adopted an MLDA21 on their own and those that were coerced by the FUDAA [Federal Underage Drinking Act]. The results are striking. Virtually all the life-saving impact of the MLDA21 comes from the few early-adopting states, not from the larger number that resulted from federal pressure. Further, any life-saving effect in those states that first raised the drinking age was only temporary, occurring largely in the first year or two after switching to the MLDA21. Our results thus challenge both the value of the MLDA21 and the value of coercive federalism. While we find limited evidence that the MLDA21 saves lives when states adopted it of their own volition, we find no evidence it saves lives when the federal government compels this policy… The major implication of these results is that the drinking age does not produce its main claimed benefit. Moreover, it plausibly generates side effects, like binge drinking and disrespect for the law.”

Moreover, we already have a proven system that can, and does, deliver energy to us with great efficiency – the utility grid...  [T]he two pathways – the hydrogen pipeline vs. the electricity grid... assume the use of photovoltaic electricity. Remarkably the hydrogen route wastes twice as much energy as the utility grid pathway...  Okay, let's say we skip the hydrogen pipeline entirely and consider... a totally off-grid home. True, we can generate electricity for our homes and fuel our cars with hydrogen, but we must remember that our photovoltaics ultimately provide the electricity – hydrogen acts simply as a storage medium for that energy. A battery will do the same...  At the very least, a renewably based hydrogen economy will require the installation of US$40 trillion worth of photovoltaic pannels, of which US$20 trillion is wasted in overcoming the inefficiency of the system – minimum!  In simple terms, the decision to go with a renewably fueled utility grid system, as opposed to the hydrogen system, would save enough money in photovoltaic panels alone to provide every American family with an electric car and the photovoltaic panels to run it."""

As a society we can choose whether to make it easier for people to escape prostitution or whether to make life harder for those trapped in it.

10	"From a Legal Perspective, Do the Words ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Improperly Endorse Religion?"	"""While the principle that public schools cannot organize and facilitate religious practices such as prayer has long been recognized, the Ninth Circuit decision was controversial because it strikes two words from the Pledge based on the subjective experience of listeners. Many unfamiliar with the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause doctrine would not have supposed that being required to listen to a phrase such as 'under God' would amount to a constitutional harm. And those same persons, when posed with the question of whether they believed the Pledge of Allegiance to be a religious exercise, would have probably answered 'no.' Thus Michael Newdow's claim can be seen as doubly anomalous, resting on the feelings of a religious outsider when required to passively listen to a marginally religious message...  [T]he Establishment Clause should not be interpreted as requiring elimination of every religious message or practice. Demanding inclusion merely inverts the classifications of judicial winners and losers, but does little to promote the overall well-being of society's members."""

10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“The one thing you need to know about the minimum wage, it was designed for entry-level jobs that teach people soft work skills.

10	Is Life in Prison without Parole a Better Option Than the Death Penalty?	"""In many states, the expansion—and the very existence—of life without parole sentences can be directly linked to the struggle to end capital punishment. Death penalty opponents often accept—and even zealously promote--life without parole as a preferable option, in the process becoming champions of a punishment that is nearly unknown in the rest of the developing world...   Though the requirement that life/LWOP sentences be served in solitary confinement is codified into law only in Connecticut, it exists in practice throughout the nation...  Research has confirmed that even brief periods in solitary alter brain chemistry and produce psychiatric symptoms ranging from extreme depression to active psychosis. Some prisoners who have spent longer amounts of time in isolation describe it as a condition that slowly degrades both their humanity and sanity, turning them into blind animals given to interminable pacing, smearing their cells with feces, or engaging in self-mutilation."""

10	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""[I]n cases of gang rape by sportsmen in Australia in 2004, it has become clear that the use of prostituted women and strip clubs is integral to the womanhating and male bonding which led to the sexual violence. The argument also suggests that women who are not prostituted are safer because some other women are set aside to be commercially raped on their behalf. Women's equality requires that all women should be free from sexual exploitation. Prostitution cannot eliminate rape when it is itself bought rape. The connection between rape and prostitution is that women are turned into objects for men's sexual use; they can be either bought or stolen. A culture in which women can be bought for use is one in which rape flourishes."""
10	Saturday Halloween - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Moving Halloween to Saturday would put kids on the streets on the most dangerous night of the week. Halloween is already a dangerous holiday, with about 43% more pedestrians dying on the holiday than other autumn nights. [21] Moving the holiday to Saturdays, the most dangerous day of the week, could further increase injuries and deaths because people would start drinking alcohol earlier in the day, and consume more overall than they would on a weeknight. Drunk drivers are already involved in more than 25% of pedestrian deaths on Halloween. [22] Ensuring that Halloween always occurs on a weekend night would lead to more binge drinking and drunk driving, making pedestrians less safe. [22] Drivers ages 15 to 25 are responsible for nearly a third of all child pedestrian fatal accidents on Halloween. Moving the holiday to the weekend every year would likely increase the fatalities because of later curfews and a lack of school and other responsibilities the following day. [23] Saturdays have the most fatal car crashes of any day, with a total of 5,873 during 2017 (over 500 more than the second-highest crash day). [24][25] In 2017, there were an additional 799,000 nonfatal traffic accidents on Saturdays. [24] 53% more road deaths occur on Saturdays than on Tuesdays, the safest day of the week. [26]

10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“Voters know that gun safety does not mean whittling away at their Right to Keep and Bear Arms. It doesn’t mean restricting where or how a law-abiding citizen can exercise a constitutionally protected right. And, it certainly doesn’t mean forcing hunters or target shooters to go to a Federally Licensed Firearm dealer for a background check before they can borrow each other’s guns for an afternoon. Real gun safety is the fact that over the last 20 years, the annual number of gun-related accidental deaths has decreased by more than half. Or the fact that guns are only involved in 0.4% of accidental deaths among the U.S. population. Real gun safety is also found in the training programs that the NRA offers each year by one of our more than 125,000 NRA Certified Instructors and Range Safety Officers. The gun control agenda has one goal, and it has nothing to do with keeping people safe. Instead, it has everything to do with decreasing the number of guns in America and making them more difficult to legally purchase. That doesn’t make Americans safer?—it simply makes them unarmed and vulnerable.” [Editor’s Note: On Oct. 5 the NRA released a joint statement from CEO and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and Chief Lobbyist for the NRA-ILA Chris Cox that included a reaffirmation of the organization’s stance against gun control, and the following: “The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” The statement was made in response to the shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, 2017 in which the shooter used bump stocks to make semi-automatic guns function like automatic guns.]

In forswearing the giving of poison when asked for it, the Hippocratic physician rejects the view that the patient's choice for death can make killing him right. For the physician, at least, human life in living bodies commands respect and reverence--by its very nature. As its respectability does not depend upon human agreement or patient consent, revocation of one's consent to live does not deprive one's living body of respectability. The deepest ethical principle restraining the physician's power is not the autonomy or freedom of the patient; neither is it his own compassion or good intention. Rather, it is the dignity and mysterious power of human life itself, and therefore, also what the Oath calls the purity and holiness of life and art to which he has sworn devotion."""

My answer is an emphatic 'yes.' Safety must, of course, always be at the heart of the case for nuclear energy, and regulators must make this their top priority... Modern nuclear technologies have multi-layered safety systems in place that offer a huge improvement on the older power plants...  The industry has a strong safety record and there is no reason to believe that this cannot be maintained into the future – a fact that must not be drowned out by those rushing to condemn nuclear energy.

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	Same-sex couples should have access to the same benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. There are 1,138 benefits, rights and protections available to married couples in federal law alone, according to a General Accounting Office assessment made in 2004. [86] Benefits only available to married couples include hospital visitation during an illness, the option of filing a joint tax return to reduce a tax burden, access to family health coverage, US residency and family unification for partners from another country, and bereavement leave and inheritance rights if a partner dies. [6] [95] Married couples also have access to protections if the relationship ends, such as child custody, spousal or child support, and an equitable division of property. [93] Married couples in the US armed forces are offered health insurance and other benefits unavailable to domestic partners. [125] The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the US Department of Labor also recognize married couples, for the purpose of granting tax, retirement and health insurance benefits. [126] The US federal government does not grant equivalent benefits to gay couples in civil unions or domestic partnerships.

As a result, it rests firmly under the control of the patient, especially if they are educated about healthy nutrition and how to make intelligent choices about what foods and groceries they consume. To call obesity a disease is a ‘dumbing down’ of the very idea of what a disease is. And unfortunately, it implies that the patient is helpless to do anything about it.”
10	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""Count me among the discontented. Obamacare has harmed too many of my patients.

Obamacare's assault on the doctor-patient relationship first manifested this time last year, when my patients began receiving cancellation letters indicating that their plans didn't meet the law's minimum requirements...  In their zeal to regulate and standardize health care, the law's authors empowered bureaucrats in Washington to drown doctors like me in a deluge of paperwork and reporting requirements.   This has only forced doctors like me to spend less time treating patients. Compared to when Obamacare was passed, I now spend roughly half my time on data entry and administrative work. I feel more like a data entry clerk than a doctor. Surely this time would be better spent in the treatment room or on the phone with patients conducting follow-ups.   I could keep going. Obamacare was passed on the promise that it would expand and improve medical care—indeed, that it would make quality health care universal. For too many of my patients, this promise has been broken.

01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“I believe we should give strong support to school districts that decide to require young students to wear school uniforms.

In Detroit, a 15-year-old boy was shot for his $86 basketball shoes. In Fort Lauderdale, a 15-year-old student was robbed of his jewelry. Just this past December in Oxon Hill, Maryland, a 17-year-old honor student was killed at a bus stop, caught in the crossfire during the robbery of another student’s designer jacket. School uniforms are one step that may be able to help break this cycle of violence, truancy, and disorder by helping young students to understand that what really counts is what kind of people they are, what’s on the inside, to remember that what they’re doing at school is working, not showing off their own clothes or envying another student’s clothes… If it means teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms. If it means that the schoolrooms will be more orderly, more disciplined, and that our young people will learn to evaluate themselves by what they are on the inside instead of what they’re wearing on the outside, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms.”

10	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""Most life-cycle studies have found that replacing gasoline with ethanol modestly reduces greenhouse gases (GHGs) if made from corn and substantially if made from cellulose or sugarcane...  Unfortunately, by excluding emissions from land-use change, most previous accountings were one-sided because they counted the carbon benefits of using land for biofuels but not the carbon costs, the carbon storage and sequestration sacrificed by diverting land from its existing uses. Without biofuels, the extent of cropland reflects the demand for food and fiber. To produce biofuels, farmers can directly plow up more forest or grassland, which releases to the atmosphere much of the carbon previously stored in plants and soils through decomposition or fire. The loss of maturing forests and grasslands also foregoes ongoing carbon sequestration as plants grow each year, and this foregone sequestration is the equivalent of additional emissions...  We calculated that an ethanol increase of 56 billion liters, diverting corn from 12.8 million ha [1 ha = 2.47 acres] of U.S. cropland, would in turn bring 10.8 million ha of additional land into cultivation. Locations would include 2.8 million ha in Brazil, 2.3 million ha in China and India, and 2.2 million ha in the United States...  We calculated that GHG savings from corn ethanol would equalize and therefore 'pay back' carbon emissions from land-use change in 167 years, meaning GHGs increase until the end of that period. Over a 30-year period, counting land-use change, GHG emissions from corn ethanol nearly double those from gasoline for each km driven."""

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Deep ocean currents, not human activity, are a primary driver of natural climate warming and cooling cycles. Changes in ocean currents are primarily responsible for the melting Greenland ice sheet, Arctic sea ice, and Arctic permafrost. Over the 20th century there have been two Arctic warming periods with a cooling period (1940-1970) in between. According to a 2009 study in Geophysical Research Letters, natural shifts in the ocean currents are the major cause of these climate changes, not human-generated greenhouse gases. [124] According to William Gray, PhD, Emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, most of the climate changes over the last century are natural and ""due to multi-decadal and multi-century changes in deep global ocean currents."" [122] Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. [123] According to a 2014 article by Don Easterbrook, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Geology at Western Washington University, the ""PDO cool mode has replaced the warm mode in the Pacific Ocean, virtually assuring us of about 30 years of global cooling, perhaps much deeper than the global cooling from about 1945 to 1977.""

Specifically if nuclear energy is considered 'alternative' (to fossil fuels) then I am in the Pro camp. If nuclear is not considered alternative I am decidedly in the Con camp because I do not believe it is remotely possible to replace fossil fuels with wind, solar, geothermal etc. by themselves. Then there is the question of whether hydroelectricity is 'alternative'. If both hydro and nuclear are not considered alternative then it is doubly impossible to replace fossil fuels with alternatives.   The terms 'renewable', 'sustainable', 'clean', 'green', and 'alternative' tend to be tossed about as if they all mean the same thing when they each have distinct meanings, some of which are less than objective. 'Green', for example, can be a shameless marketing term. 'Clean' is relatively straightforward, meaning there is no pollution involved. Hydroelectric energy is renewable. Nuclear energy is not renewable but it is sustainable.""  [Editor's Note: The term ""alternative energy"" has numerous definitions. On this website ""alternative energy"" refers to any form of energy that is not derived from fossil fuels (oil, coal, or natural gas).

10	Do the Health Insurance Exchanges Benefit Consumers? - DEBATED	"""Running their own exchanges won't empower states to prevent both the most economical and the most comprehensive health plans from disappearing from their markets. Affordable plans will disappear because Obamacare requires all purchasers to buy whatever coverage Sebelius mandates as 'essential,' a definition that will grow ever broader, as such definitions always do. The law's price controls will require insurers to charge everyone of a given age the same premium, regardless of whether an actuarially fair premium might be $5,000 or $50,000. Even state-run exchanges would see comprehensive health plans crumble under the weight of too many patients who cost $50,000 but pay far less. Nor can state-run exchanges prevent other dimensions of quality from eroding. Even in state-run exchanges, the sickest patients would struggle to get their claims paid by insurers who are trying to avoid, mistreat, and dump them, because that is what Obamacare's price controls reward.

Instead of solving the CO2 problem that we've created, CCS would pass the problem along to our children and their children and their children's children. Basically, buried CO2 could never be allowed to leak back out. We should take responsibility for our own problems, not pass them to our children to manage.  Scientists paid by the fossil fuel companies say the CO2 will never leak back out of the ground. What what if they're mistaken? Then our children will inherit a hot, acid-ocean, ruined world.  Sooner or later we're going to run out of fossil fuels - all of them - so eventually we have to adopt solar power. CCS just delays the inevitable - a huge waste of time and money.

The demand to release Palestinians from the oppression of the Occupation is not only a human rights demand. Rather, it is a demand for the end of the conflict, for a division of land based on an agreement, in the spirit of the Arab League and Geneva Initiatives. The suggestion to establish one state, both when it comes from the radical left or from the right, will not only deter from reaching peace but will establish a new conflict over control over the one state.  Unlike them, I want to end the occupation, but not to end the state of Israel. I want to change the state I'm living it [sic], but I don't want to give up our independence.

01	Does Marijuana Use Permanently Damage the Human Brain?	have been…incomplete or poorly controlled reports of potential brain damage from animal research, and it has been possible to dismiss most of them as inconclusive. However, two experiments on rats, one appearing in 1987 and the other in 1988, gave stronger evidence that THC causes permanent changes in the structure of neurons in the hippocampus. The doses used were in the range of what a very heavy marijuana smoker might obtain, and the treatment was given to the rats every day for ninety days. It’s not clear what the implications might be for human beings smoking less heavily and only occasionally. Ironically, some of the nonpsychoactive ingredients in marijuana, including cannabidiol, have been shown to have powerful antioxidant properties that protect brain cells from toxic effects of other chemicals. This effect was strong enough that the NIMH [National Institute of Mental Health] filed a patent in 1988 entitled ‘Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants.'”
01	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""The single greatest pressure on healthcare today is financial. As we seek to grapple with the staggering costs of healthcare, we need to avoid undermining the very ethical principles that promote good patient care. If we allow physician assisted suicide, we may find out that we have effectively limited our approach to the palliation of chronic illness. Unfortunately, it is cheaper to help a patient to die than to provide good end of life care. Physician assisted suicide could encourage a patient to die as a 'duty' to his or her family, in the face of financial pressure. Likewise doctors could find their end of life care options curtailed by third party payers, or offered economic incentive to allow a suicide. As society ages, this could become a national tragedy."""

Even under ideal conditions, it would be extremely difficult to detect many of the conceivable e-cheating methods... The ostensible motivation for using e-voting stems largely from the dramatic 2000-election problems that were associated with punched card voting systems. A better approach is to have teams of poll workers and poll watchers manually count ballots manually marked by voters.

We can't have a nation under God unless there is a God. It doesn't say one nation under our god, or some gods, or one of the gods. It pretty clearly implies there is only one God, and if there is only one God, then the God of the Pledge is the one true God, and other alleged gods around the world are false gods...

[97] Adam Winkler, MA, JD, UCLA Constitutional Law Professor, stated ""The KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns"" so, after the Civil War, there was ""constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt.” [97] In Virginia, in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion (also called the Southampton Rebellion, in which slaves killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States) in 1831, a law was passed that prohibited free black people ""to keep or carry any firelock of any kind, any military weapon, or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed.

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""America's insatiable appetite for the good things energy delivers could not be satisfied by fossil fuels alone. Hydroelectric power, a renewable source of energy created by the damming of rapidly-flowing rivers, was introduced in the 1890s, as was nuclear power in the late 1950s. In recent years, other renewable sources of energy – wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal – have entered the fray. However, while the use of renewable fuels is expected to increase in the years to come, their overall contribution to America's energy pool is forecast by the EIA [US Energy Information Agency] to remain very modest, far behind fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Nuclear power, by contrast, which currently supplies about 20 percent of US electricity, is expected to become a more prominent player as a new generation of power plants go into service in the decades to come."""

E-Verify employers routinely violate the program rules, and that hurts workers... 42% of workers say that they aren't notified by their employer of an E-Verify error. And if a worker doesn't know that an error exists they have no way to correct it... Because the livelihood of US citizens is at risk, even seemingly small error rates really matter.

"""Adults are free to make their own choices with respect to what drugs they put in their body (although they do have to face the consequences - personal and legal - of doing so). The problem for sports doping is that some of the substances athletes use are not approved for human medical use at any level. Trenbolone, for instance, is a cattle steroid. So the school of thought that advocates legalizing doping, or holds that an athlete has the right to choose whether to endanger his health, is ignoring a completely separate ethical and legal question: should people have the right to use a substance that is not legal for human use under ANY circumstances?

The best way to begin is to implement a compulsory system of private retirement-savings accounts for individuals… In a private-account system, there’s no reliance on demographic trends and the government’s ability to tax workers… One way to implement such a system is to make 401(k) plans mandatory for every worker. Restrictions could be placed on withdrawals, to make sure people accumulate enough for retirement. To prevent workers from taking too much risk, investment choices could be limited to low-cost, diversified options, such as target-date funds… An account funded as described above is likely to provide a far bigger percentage of a retiree’s pre-retirement income than Social Security does.

However imperfect a gold standard may be, it remains the best among all alternatives. The empirical data for both the classical gold standard, which I favor – and even the flawed ‘gold-exchange’ standard, as we had under the Bretton Woods system – are impressive. Economic growth was stronger, unemployment rates lower, the price level more stable, and recessions less frequent and less severe than under the present system. I realize the Washington establishment goes ballistic at this suggestion. Gold is kryptonite to big-spending politicians. It is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires. The American people are another story. Nearly half (44%) support a return to a gold standard, according to an October 2011 Rasmussen Report. That support soars to 57% when respondents know it will ‘dramatically reduce the powers of bankers and the political class to steer the economy.’… The political establishment will fight this idea viciously, because gold convertibility strips them of power and places the trump card over monetary policy with the people. If you thought the establishment attacked me over 9-9-9, wait until you see how they react to a classic gold standard. The vampires will be out in full force. The debate over sound money has moved from whether we need it to how we get there. The pieces are moving in the right direction, and we have an opportunity to make the dollar once again as good as gold.”
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The concept that 'mom's job' is having sex with strangers sets the wrong tone for family life. It hurts the woman, it hurts the children; that is an exploitative situation. If prostitution is legal it affords men the 'excuse' to go find sex outside of marriage, when things in the marriage are difficult. That does nothing to enhance the relationship between a man and a woman.   {Prostitution] runs opposite to what relationships are supposed to be. Intimacy and love are not involved; it's just a purely physical act. It lowers both people to the lowest common denominator."""

01	Has Obamacare Improved Medicaid? - DEBATED	"""Beyond expanding Medicaid, the ACA introduced other reforms that improve the program in all states, regardless of their Medicaid expansion decision. The law required states to simplify and modernize their enrollment processes, and to create a coordinated eligibility and enrollment system for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Marketplace, to facilitate enrollment and promote continuity of coverage. The ACA also established an array of new authorities and funding opportunities for delivery system and payment reform initiatives in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, designed to advance better and more cost-effective models of care, particularly for those with high needs and costs, whose care is poorly coordinated, leading to both serious gaps and costly redundancy. Finally, the law provided new options and incentives to help states rebalance their Medicaid long-term care programs in favor of community-based services and supports rather than institutional care. Collectively, these provisions have accelerated Medicaid innovation already underway in many states...  The ACA includes many investments, funding opportunities, demonstration programs, and new authorities designed to drive health care delivery and payment system reforms in Medicaid and other public insurance programs. These provisions have accelerated ongoing innovation in Medicaid programs, including implementation of models like patient-centered medical homes and accountable care organizations (ACOs) that involve a more central role for preventive and primary care, increased care coordination for beneficiaries with complex needs, and financial incentives linked to performance. States are combining and integrating these approaches in different ways with their underlying delivery and payment systems in Medicaid. The ACA also provides states with expanded options and enhanced federal financing to improve access to and delivery of Medicaid long-term services and supports."""

10	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""There is no proof that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from human activity. Ice core records from the past 650,000 years show that temperature increases have preceded—not resulted from—increases in CO2 by hundreds of years, suggesting that the warming of the oceans is an important source of the rise in atmospheric CO2. As the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapor is far, far more important than CO2. Dire predictions of future warming are based almost entirely on computer climate models, yet these models do not accurately understand the role or water vapor—and, in any case, water vapor is not within our control. Plus, computer models cannot account for the observed cooling of much of the past century (1940–75), nor for the observed patterns of warming—what we call the 'fingerprints.' For example, the Antarctic is cooling while models predict warming. And where the models call for the middle atmosphere to warm faster than the surface, the observations show the exact opposite.  The best evidence supporting natural causes of temperature fluctuations are the changes in cloudiness, which correspond strongly with regular variations in solar activity. The current warming is likely part of a natural cycle of climate warming and cooling that's been traced back almost a million years."""

10	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Global food inflation was 43% during the 12 months ending in March, 2008. While this rate is high, it is not unprecedented. Similar rates were seen in the mid-70s and other periods have experienced high world food-price inflation. But that makes the current situation no less difficult...  I recognize the contribution of biofuel production to recent food-price increases is a topic of particular interest to the Committee. The bottom line is that ethanol production is a significant contributor to increases in corn prices, but neither U.S. nor worldwide biofuel production can account for much of the rise in food prices.  Among the existing stock of biofuels, ethanol is by far the largest type, with corn-based ethanol accounting for a substantial portion of total ethanol. Corn-based ethanol production has increased dramatically over the past year with approximately 25% of total U.S. corn production dedicated to ethanol production in 2007. We estimate that the increase in U.S. corn-based ethanol production accounts for approximately 7.5 percentage points of the 37% increase in corn prices over the past twelve months. The increase in corn-based ethanol production in the rest of the world this past year accounts for as much as an additional 5.5 percentage points. Combining the increases in ethanol production in the U.S. and the rest of the world, we estimate that the total global increase in corn-based ethanol production accounts for about 13 percentage points of the 37% increase in corn prices, or about one-third of the increase in corn prices over the past year.  Let me put this in context. Because corn only represents a small fraction of the IMF Global Food Index, we estimate that the increase in total corn-based ethanol production has pushed up global food prices by about 1.2 percentage points of the 43% increase in global food prices, or about 3% of the increase over the past twelve months."""

And yet, we don't let everyone vote. We don't let children vote, for instance, or noncitizens, or the mentally incompetent. Why? Because we don't trust them and their judgment. We have different reasons for not trusting them, but it seems to me that that is their common denominator.   For some groups of people, their untrustworthiness trumps the instrumental and equitable presumptions. We're confident enough that children and the mentally incompetent lack good judgment; we don't see it as inequitable to bar noncitizens from voting, and we question their commitment to our res publica.

These international positions simply highlight further the irony in our Constitution, and although the implications of health and health care as human rights are still hotly debated, the case in favor, in our view, has never been stronger. We therefore propose that the Congress and the people of the United States be given the opportunity to approve an amendment to the Constitution stating: ‘All citizens and other residents of the United States shall have equal access to basic and essential health care.'”

The resulting Palestinian statelet would be blocked off physically from the Israeli economy, its major cities would be cut off from each other, and its government would be unable to control the territory's water resources, develop its agriculture, or manage its trade with neighboring states...  [T]he one-state solution, would resolve the entire conflict in one magisterial gesture and is already an impending reality. It would absorb all the entrenched populations between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River into one unified state...

My friends, what we have here is a colossal failure of imagination… The same digital technologies that transformed every other aspect of modern life can transform education, provide our businesses with the talent they need to thrive, and give hundreds of millions of young people at the fringes of prosperity the opportunity to make their own mark on this global economy. …[B]ringing digital innovation to the classroom can substantially improve education for children throughout the world – including many now callously written off as hopeless… The key is not just a computer or a tablet or some other device, but also software that will engage students and help teach them concepts and learn to think for themselves. …There are many different ways to teach children fractions – all of which work for some kids, and don’t work for others. Why should we be limited? Why can’t we use digital technology to give teachers the choice of all of them?… I know the critics say that if you introduce technology to the classroom, you are simply replacing teachers with computers and blackboards with screens. But the critics are wrong. Technology will never replace the teacher. What we can do is relieve some of the drudgery of teaching. And we can take advantage of the increasingly sophisticated analytics that will help teachers spend more time on the things that make us all more human and more creative… In our own backyards, we have millions of young people whose minds are the key to our future.

01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""There is only one solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if 'solution' means ending the conflict, and that is two states for two peoples.

Each side is fighting for a land they can call their own, on which they express their identity, and through which their identity is expressed. Both movements are fighting over the same piece of land. The option of one united peaceful state with a homogenized identity – the United States of Israel-Palestine – is not real because neither side wants a homogenized identity; both sides are willing to continue to fight, with even more passion and venom so that the one state takes on their own identity.   When I meet Israelis and Palestinians who advocate the so-called 'one state solution,' as soon as I dig below the nice slogans, what I find is that the Israelis are talking about a Jewish state with a large Arab minority and the Palestinians are talking about a Palestinian state with a large Jewish minority. Neither side of the so-called 'one-staters' is really willing to give up its dream of the territorial expression of its identity.  So like it or not… we do not have a choice – there has to be a two-state solution, and obviously the longer we procrastinate in making the hard decisions, the more difficult it will be."""
01	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""[O]ur recent research shows that each execution carried out is correlated with about 74 fewer murders the following year... The study examined the relationship between the number of executions and the number of murders in the U.S. for the 26-year period from 1979 to 2004, using data from publicly available FBI sources... There seems to be an obvious negative correlation in that when executions increase, murders decrease, and when executions decrease, murders increase...   In the early 1980s, the return of the death penalty was associated with a drop in the number of murders. In the mid-to-late 1980s, when the number of executions stabilized at about 20 per year, the number of murders increased. Throughout the 1990s, our society increased the number of executions, and the number of murders plummeted. Since 2001, there has been a decline in executions and an increase in murders.   It is possible that this correlated relationship could be mere coincidence, so we did a regression analysis on the 26-year relationship. The association was significant at the .00005 level, which meant the odds against the pattern being simply a random happening are about 18,000 to one. Further analysis revealed that each execution seems to be associated with 71 fewer murders in the year the execution took place...

The inability of many countries to produce their own food is the result of decades, if not centuries, of distortions in international trade of agricultural products. Protectionism is a burden. Equally burdensome are the subsidies to agriculture of the rich which undermine the competitiveness of the small farmer...  Brazil has also focused on the enormous potential of biofuels, as an instrument of economic and social change in the poorest countries...  It is therefore with growing concern that I see attempts to create a relationship of cause and effect between development of biofuels and shortage of food or increase in food prices...  Biofuels are not the villain that is threatening the food security of the poorest nations. On the contrary, if developed with care and in accordance with the reality of each country, they can act as a crucial instrument for generating income and lifting countries out of food and energy insecurity."""
10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“It’s not the weapons. The weapons have nothing to do with it. Again, these weapons are in every pickup truck in Texas. People have to get past the hardware. I would never turn against this wonderful tool that brings me self-defense capabilities and brings me great joy in competition and marksmanship training. In all these mass shootings, it’s not a matter of bullets or firepower. A quail gun in the wrong hands is as deadly as this gun [points to an AR rifle]. People have got to come to that reality. There is no gun violence. There is criminal violence. And they use an assortment of tools. The gun owners of America are causing no problem. Leave us alone. Let’s go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes. Let’s go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods.”

Additionally, this research suggests that playing a realistic first-person shooter game with a firearm controller may be quite worthy of concern as a possible triple whammy risk factor for developing aggressive knowledge structures and, potentially, subsequent aggressive behavior… This finding is of concern, given that guns play a leading role in the majority of today’s most popular videogames and the industry has introduced hundreds of control devices that mimic the look, feel, and action of real-life firearms.”

10	Does the Use of Illegal Performance Enhancing Drugs by Some Athletes Coerce Other Athletes to Also Use Them to Remain Competitive?	"""In its claim that steroid use 'victimizes' non-users by giving them three undesirable choices -- lose out to the biologically enhanced, quit the game, or imperil their bodies by becoming users themselves -- the Mitchell Report pushes the argument a little deeper.   [I]f the majority of the players, as the [Mitchell] report suggests, would truly prefer to stay chemically clean and avoid the need for this unwelcome choice, they could easily and successfully remove such pressures by agreeing collectively to expose the violators and to shame them. Moreover, the concern about coercion fails to get to the heart of the matter: competition is always demanding, often coercively so, and competitive athletes are always forced to measure up to their peers in training and practice or else be left behind. And many of the sports we find most thrilling -- football, hockey, boxing, downhill skiing -- require putting one's body in peril. One of the athletic virtues we most admire is 'playing hurt,' which often means placing excellence in action above bodily well-being."""
01	Universal Basic Income - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"UBI leads to positive job growth and lower school dropout rates. The guarantee of UBI protects people from sluggish wage growth, low wages, and the lack of job security caused by the effects of the growing ""gig"" economy such as Uber/Lyft driving, short-term contracts, and increased automation in the workplace. [4][5][10] UBIs also enable people to stay in school longer and participate in training to improve skills or learn a trade. Researchers from the Roosevelt Institute created three models for US implementation of UBI and found that under all scenarios, UBI would grow the economy, increasing output, employment, prices, and wages. [44] Since implementation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, the increased purchasing power of UBI recipients has resulted in 10,000 additional jobs for the state. [6] Uganda's UBI trial, the Youth Opportunities Program, enabled participants to invest in skills training as well as tools and materials, resulting in an increase of business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%. [8] The Canadian Mincome trial in the 1970's found that participants of the trial were more likely to complete high school than counterparts not involved in the trial. [1] The Basic Income Grant trial in Namibia (2007-2012) enabled parents to afford school fees, buy school uniforms, and encourage attendance. As a result, school dropout rates fell from almost 40% in Nov. 2007 to 5% in June 2008 to almost 0% in Nov. 2008. [7]"

The complexity actually becomes one more way that voters are disenfranchised by the computerized machines.

The estimated atmospheric emissions of 0.02g of Cd per GWh [gigawatt hour] of electricity produced during all the phases of the modules' life, are extremely low. Large-scale use of CdTe PV modules does not present any risks to health and the environment, and recycling the modules at the end of their useful life completely resolves any environmental concerns. During their operation, these modules do not produce any pollutants, and, furthermore, by displacing fossil fuels, they offer great environmental benefits. CdTe in PV appears to be more environmentally friendly than all other current uses of Cd, including Ni–Cd [nickel-cadium] batteries."""

10	Should Cannabidiol (CBD) Be a Medical Option?	is currently controlled in schedule I under the drug code for marijuana, 7360. The drug code 7372 for cannabidiol is used by DEA only for internal record-keeping purposes. DEA is currently working on a Final Rule to establish the drug code for marihuana extract as 7350. In July 2011, DEA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register. The NPRM proposes the establishment of a new drug code for marijuana extract independent of the drug code for marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinols. Drug codes are linked to DEA registrations and provide specificity as to the substance/drug/or chemical each registrant canpossess under their registration. The codes are also used for internal tracking purposes. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, requires statistical reporting to the United Nations on the use and production of marijuana and marijuana extract for the medical and scientific needs of each party of the treaty. The statistical reports for marijuana and marijuana extract have to be reported separately for the U.S. to be in compliance with this treaty… Cannabidiol has always been a schedule I controlled substance listed under marijuana… The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is the U.S. competent authority for determining whether a substance is safe and effective for medical use and for approving a drug product for marketing in the United States. DEA would therefore defer to DHHS for any related questions… The Federal Register notice published in FR Vol 57 10499-10508, 1992, details the issues and criteria for determining accepted medical use… DEA performed an outreach to the scientific community to obtain data on the current state of research and abuse potential of cannabidiol. DEA’s scientific review involving cannabidiol depends upon reliable and peer-reviewed scientific studies which are still being gathered as they become available.” [Editor’s Note: ProCon.org also emailed five additional questions below to the DEA on Oct. 5, 2011 and received confirmation on Oct. 6, 2011 that they were forwarded to the appropriate DEA Section Chief for comment. As of May 29, 2012, we have not yet received a response. “1. Since drug code 7372 is used by DEA only for internal record-keeping purposes, could you please provide all the internal drug codes between 7350 and 7380 along with which substance they correspond to? Since we had seen the drug code 7372 on DEA Form 225 on the DEA website we did not realize that internal codes existed. 2. When do you expect that DEA will complete its work on a Final Rule establishing the drug code for marijuana extract as 7350? A specific deadline would be ideal, but a ballpark estimate would also be useful. 3. Which substances would be classified under the new drug code 7350? 4. Will cannabidiol itself be classified under 7350 since it does not contain ‘cannabidinols AND cannabidiols’ as specified in the proposed drug code? 5. How will the new 7350 classification affect the DHHS patent [United States Patent #6,630,507 (185 KB) Oct 7, 2003] on cannabinoids and cannabidiol if at all?”]

10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	DTC prescription drug ads increase health care costs. 78% of doctors surveyed in 2013 agreed that DTC prescription drug ads increased the cost of healthcare. [42] 37% of doctors surveyed said they often or sometimes prescribed brand name drugs because the patient requested the brand name drug rather than prescribe the equivalent and cheaper generic drug. [56] Brand name drugs cost 30 to 80% more than generic drugs. [56] Because generic drugs are not advertised and do not require R&D budgets to develop, they are cheaper than brand-name drugs. According to a Nov. 23, 2009 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine, the cost of Plavix increased (as did the amount of Medicaid funds spent for Plavix in pharmacies) due to the need to recoup the high costs of DTC drug advertising.

10	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""For the VVPT system to work as a backup for counting the vote accurately, it seems that every voter must verify every ballot... But this is a very tall order. Setting up reliable means for voters to verify, or, more importantly, refuse to verify, their ballots at the polling place adds a significant burden at the polling place...  Even with paper records that are actually voter verified, there are significant remaining questions. There are questions about the accuracy, reliability and fraud-potential for the counting of paper records, with the long history of lost, mangled and manipulated paper ballots...  If a malicious programmer or an outside 'hacker' can change the electronic record of the vote, certainly such a skilled person can make the printer provide a paper record that doesn't expose any error... Under this scenario, the voter and the poll worker are not alerted to the problem. So, in this example, the paper does not indicate a problem with the machine, and does not provide a safeguard."""
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	OTC birth control pills could lower teen pregnancy rates. From 2007 to 2013, the nationwide teen pregnancy rate dropped 36% among 15- to 19-year-olds because of improved contraceptive use. [20] Teens may be more likely to use OTC birth control because taking the Pill is a daily routine and is not tied to the emotional pressure attached to sex the way using a condom is. [21] Krishna Upadhya, MD, MPH, physician, stated: “Decades of research show that a majority of adolescents initiate sex before the age of 18 and that earlier use of contraception reduces the risk of teen pregnancy. Our review strongly suggests that giving teens easier access to various contraceptives will not lead to more sex but would result in fewer unwanted pregnancies… [and] any future over-the-counter pill has the potential to benefit teens.” [21] Read More

01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""In light of our proven inability to enforce a zero-tolerance approach to sport, we should instead take a pragmatic approach. As a very brief and incomplete overview, I argue that we should allow doping within safe, measurable physiological parameters...  For years, we have been pretending that the problem was Lance Armstrong, Dwayne Chambers or Marion Jones. Now we are told the problem is not individuals, but a country (Russia). Or an organization, the IAAF.  But even these are not the problem. The problem is human nature. Athletics is humanity pushed to extremes, both physically and mentally. There are enormous prizes for extraordinary physical feats. There are effective means of enhancing performance. At the same time, our anti-doping capabilities are anemic and sporadically enforced...  Yes, athletes will still try and cheat wherever the line is drawn. But by focusing on measurable physiological parameters, and only using zero tolerance on drugs that are unsafe in any dose, we will have a chance to alter the balance so the rules we do have are enforceable, and it is rational not to cheat. We will also be able to tell athletes, teams and national agencies that these rules really matter...

No ISP [internet service provider] is involved in the uploading of unofficial results. The unofficial results are sent over a private point-to-point connection between the polling place (or another location) and election central.

Taking under God out of the Pledge would not be an attack on anyone's freedom... I would suggest that the use of under God is not necessary to remind the government of the natural freedoms we have. The version of the Pledge before the amendment in 1954 reads as follows:  'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'  I believe that this version of the Pledge accomplishes all the same goals of promoting freedom and patriotism without establishing any religion. Since the original version of the Pledge did not have the phrase under God it would be natural for the country to readopt an older version of the Pledge."""
10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	The gold standard caused many financial panics, bank failures, and prolonged the Great Depression. Between 1879 and 1933 the United States had financial panics in 1884, 1890, 1893, 1907, 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1933. [45] During the panic of 1933 alone 4,000 banks suspended operations. [48] Many of these panics were exacerbated by contraction in the money supply caused by the gold standard (more money could not be printed without first acquiring additional gold to back it). [41] Many economists contend that the gold standard played a role in preventing the United States from stabilizing the economy after the stock market crash of 1929, and prolonged the Great Depression. In 1933, when the United States went off the full domestic gold standard, the economy began to recover. [49] [44] [50] Read More

For an agency whose mission is to develop reasonably uniform practices throughout the anti-doping world, failing to provide some guidance to the labs as to what constitutes a positive (or 'non-negative,' to use WADA-speak) result is a serious abdication of their duty. Why? Because the sports world could end up with a situation where one lab would declare a doping violation and another wouldn't when given the same data from the same person...  An athlete competing in Australia, Europe, the United States and other parts of the world should be able to rest easy in the knowledge that no matter where he or she goes, the standards for what constitutes a doping violation will be the same.

01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""We are gravely concerned that a one-state 'solution' would both mean the end of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state and create the circumstances for a human rights catastrophe. Despite claims to the contrary, the creation of a binational state would be both radical and antithetical to genuine peace.   The one-state idea marks a departure from the well-established premise of 'two states for two peoples,' a solution supported by a strong majority of both Israelis and Palestinians. Support for a binational state ignores the undeniable fact that Israeli and Palestinian societies are drastically different in terms of economic development, political orientation, and cultural identity—a situation which would not change with the removal of a political border. Given the two sides' history of mutual hostility and resentment, the creation of a single state will likely lead to violent ethnic conflict, a result desired by none but the most radical elements in the region. As a result, a majority of experts across the political spectrum agree that despite difficulties in reaching an agreement, a two-state solution is far preferable to a one-state non-solution."""

01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“We write today to ask that you and other appropriate state officials reconsider California’s policy on vaccine exemptions… While a small number of children cannot be vaccinated due to an underlying medical condition, we believe there should be no such thing as a philosophical or personal belief exemption, since everyone uses public spaces. As we have learned in the past month, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk, but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate. California’s current law allows two options for parents to opt out of vaccine requirements for school and daycare: they must either make this decision with the aid of a health professional, or they can simply check a box claiming that they have religious objections to medical care. We think both options are flawed, and oppose even the notion of a medical professional assisting to waive a vaccine requirement unless there is a medical reason, such as an immune deficiency. Furthermore, recent reports have shown that the problem is not limited to parents opting out of all vaccinations. There is also a growing trend of parents failing to follow full vaccine schedules and schools and daycare centers failing to track those families that have pledged to get the required vaccines after the year begins. We think that under your leadership, California can change this practice and reassure families that all children are safe at schools, daycare centers, and in other public places.”
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“We know that women have abortions for many reasons. Even if we disagree on the issue of abortion, we can agree that these are private personal decisions we all must be able to make based on our own circumstances, beliefs, and values. We should respect and support a woman and her family as they face the life-altering decision of whether to have a child. It is neither my place nor our government’s place to make such an important life decision for someone else… We all care about life and about doing our best for the people we love. When we bring children into the world we want them to have the opportunity to live a good life. And we want to build a better future for our children and our grandchildren. Abortion and reproductive freedom more broadly defined are important pieces of ensuring this common dream. To obtain a better future, we each must be free to make profoundly personal decisions about our reproductive lives without unwarranted government intrusion. As with all freedoms, there are limits. But a government that respects the personal integrity of its people both interferes in these essentially private decisions as little as possible and helps ensure that everyone has the opportunity to make these decisions responsibly.”

In fact, the opposite is closer to the truth. Prostitution is like any other industry. Make it illegal, and you give criminals a monopoly. Legalize it, and you give law-abiding enterprises a chance to compete...   Moreover, regulated brothels now are operated as legitimate businesses, and so attract professional managers -- as opposed to underworld thugs...

First, the words 'under God'...are a historical statement, not a supplication, as would be the case in a prayer or similar religious exercise. Second, the words of the Pledge, read as a whole, are clearly the words of a patriotic statement, not of a religious invocation... This perception is strengthened by the physical acts that accompany the Pledge, such as turning to view the flag. The entire focus of the activity is the flag, which students recognize as a patriotic symbol, not as a religious one. The fact that the flag, rather than God or religion, is the focus of the Pledge, is the very reason why some religious students choose not to participate in its recitation."""
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	A right to health care could increase the wait time for medical services. Medicaid is an example of a federally funded single-payer health care system that provides a right to health care for low-income people. According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, 9.4% of Medicaid beneficiaries have had trouble obtaining necessary care due to long wait times, versus 4.2% of people with private health insurance. [102] Countries with a universal right to health care have longer wait times than in the United States. In the average wait time to see a specialist in Canada was 60 days, [136] versus 24 days in the United States. [137] In the United States, only 25% of patients had to wait at least four weeks to see a specialist compared to 59% in Canada, 56% in Norway, and 43% in the United Kingdom – all countries that have some form of a universal right to health care.

01	Is it legal for Congressional representatives to trade securities based on insider information?	"""Much Congressional trading based on nonpublic information may not violate the securities laws...[T]here are two basic ways in which persons can be held liable for insider trading.   First, an insider of the company -- i.e., a person who is an agent or fiduciary of the company or otherwise a person in whom the company has placed its trust and confidence -- may not trade in the company's stock on the basis of material nonpublic information about the company. Obviously, this basis of liability will rarely apply to Congressmen or the staffers, who will rarely have an employee or other inside relationship with the company.   Second, under the so-called misappropriation theory of insider trading, the defendant need not owe a fiduciary duty to the investor with whom he trades. Nor does he have to owe a fiduciary duty to the issuer of the securities that were traded. Instead, the misappropriation theory applies when the inside trader violates a fiduciary duty owed to the source of the information. But how often will the Congressman or his staffer owe such a duty? Typically, one suspects, the Congressman or staffer will be in an arm's-length relationship with the source of the information, as where it is learned in the course of an investigation. (The misappropriation theory might apply to staffers, if the Congressman for whom they work is deemed the source of the information. In that case, the staffer would have breached a duty to his boss by using the information and thus be liable.)"""

From 1991 to 1995, Iraq repeatedly insisted it did not have biological weapons. Then, in 1995, Saddam's son-in-law defected and told the inspectors some details of Iraq's biological weapons program. Only then did Iraq admit it had produced tens of thousands of liters of anthrax and other biological weapons. But even then, they did not come clean. UN inspectors believe Iraq had in fact produced two to four-times the amount of biological agents it had declared. Those biological agents were never found.

It would be unfair for Members of Congress and staff to use inside knowledge of Congress for pecuniary gain. But how a law like this would be effectively enforced is beyond me. A bar on congressional-insider trading would most likely cause one of the following results:  1. It would be honored in the breach; 2. It would lead to endless (perhaps politically motivated) investigations of our representatives and their staffs; or 3. It would force many or most congressional employees to withdraw from investing as a prophylactic against 2. None of these would be easy and fair, and compliance would deprive congressional staff of normal sources of income and of participation in investment that keeps their experience and thinking in line with other Americans. The law would not provide investors comfort.  The better solution is to lower the amount and value of congressional-insider information."""
01	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Social network sites help fulfill communication needs and wants. It is a convenient method of communication and provides the ability to stay connected with friends and family, but on the users own rate and time. Users can manage their interactions within their own schedule by choosing when they want to read and respond… [I]t is efficient because it is a one-to-many method of communication which allows users to quickly spread information… Social media provides students a new mechanism for a familiar exercise: that of personal expression.”
10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""As a father and an avid sports fan, I understand the dangers that performance enhancing drugs pose for athletes, as well as the teenagers who seek to emulate them, not to mention the effect that these drugs have on the integrity of sports. As president, I would use the bully pulpit of my office to warn Americans about the dangers of performance enhancing drugs, and I would put greater resources into enforcement of existing drug laws. I would also convene a summit of the commissioners of the professional sports leagues, as well as university presidents, to explore options for decreasing the use of these drugs."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Prostitution violates the right to physical and moral integrity by the alienation of women’s sexuality that is appropriated, debased and reduced to a commodity to be bought and sold.

It violates the right to liberty and security, and the prohibition of slavery, of forced labor and of trafficking in persons because millions of women and girls all over the world are held in sexual slavery to meet the demand of even more millions of male buyers of sex, and to generate profits for the capitalists of sex.  It violates the right to enjoy the highest standard of physical and mental health because violence, disease, unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and AIDS stalk, presenting constant and grave risks for women and girls in prostitution, and militating against a healthy sense of and relationship with their own bodies."""

Cow's milk contains on average about three times the amount of protein than human milk does, which creates metabolic disturbances in humans that have detrimental bone health consequence...  Milk and dairy products are pro-inflammatory and mucus producing. Milk increases the risks of respiratory conditions and allergies. It has been linked to the development of arthritis due to joints becoming inflamed...  America has one of the highest consumption of dairy, yet one of the highest rates of osteoporosis. Excess calcium needs to excreted and the kidneys bear the load, which in turn contributes to the formation of kidney stones, which have a calcium composition...  A glass of milk also contains acidic animal protein that leeches calcium from the bones, pus cells, feces components, bovine growth hormone, antibiotics, and a whole lot of unnecessary fat, cholesterol and calories — all of which create a terrible imbalance in the body."""
01	Should the US Subsidize Alternative Energies?	"""[T]here ought to be a level playing field between fossil fuels and clean energy. Right now, fossil fuels subsidies in the tax code, for the most part, are permanent and the clean energy tax credits, for the most part, are temporary. Now, there is a good reason to make tax credits, subsidies, and incentives temporary in the tax code; from a policy standpoint, that requires legislators to reevaluate how a policy is working over time and to make modifications. But when you make a tax incentive permanent, you are never forced to reevaluate your circumstances…  Many of us in Congress are working hard to accelerate the clean energy transformation already underway. And we believe that if subsidies for fossil fuels are permanent, the tax credits for clean energy should be as well. If we can't make clean energy tax credits permanent, then the fossil fuel industry should only get temporary subsidies that get reevaluated every several years."""
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Count me among the discontented. Obamacare has harmed too many of my patients.  It has done so by disrupting the doctor-patient relationship and thereby worsening the quality of patients' care. This is the heart and soul of medicine, as I have learned in in my 33 years as a practicing physician...  Obamacare's assault on the doctor-patient relationship first manifested this time last year, when my patients began receiving cancellation letters indicating that their plans didn't meet the law's minimum requirements...  Nor does it appear that any thought was given to the regulatory burden that Obamacare has imposed on physicians. In their zeal to regulate and standardize health care, the law's authors empowered bureaucrats in Washington to drown doctors like me in a deluge of paperwork and reporting requirements.  This has only forced doctors like me to spend less time treating patients. Compared to when Obamacare was passed, I now spend roughly half my time on data entry and administrative work. I feel more like a data entry clerk than a doctor. Surely this time would be better spent in the treatment room or on the phone with patients conducting follow-ups."""

01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“However heedless he could sometimes be in his personal life, Clinton brought a dutiful sensibility to his public life… One can argue over how much credit any president deserves, but the larger picture of American life at the end of the Clinton years was unmistakable. Twenty-two million jobs had been created over eight years. The budget was in surplus. Crime was down; so were welfare rolls and teen pregnancies. Home ownership was on the upswing, as were median incomes for African-Americans and Hispanics… Clinton’s presidency was anchored to an authentically populist spirit and animated by a genuine connection between a politician and common folk whose support he needed.”
10	Does the Declaration of Independence Set a Precedent for Religion in Government?	"""We are not governed by the Declaration. Its purpose was to 'dissolve the political bands,' not to set up a religious nation. Its authority was based on the idea that 'governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,' which is contrary to the biblical concept of rule by divine authority. It deals with laws, taxation, representation, war, immigration, and so on, never discussing religion at all."""

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Since its inception during the Great Depression, a strong minimum wage has been recognized as a key labor market institution that, if effectively maintained, can provide the foundation for equitable and adequate pay for American workers. However, the failure to regularly and adequately raise the federal minimum wage over the past five decades is one of several policy failures that have denied a generation of American workers more significant improvement in their quality of life. In fact, the erosion of the minimum wage has left low-wage workers today earning significantly less than their counterparts 50 years ago. Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would take its value to a level that finally ensures full-time work is a means to escape poverty, and it would provide tens of millions of America’s lowest-paid workers with a substantial, long-overdue improvement in their standard of living. Past increases in the minimum wage have been inadequate to preserve low-wage workers’ standard of living, let alone allow them to share in the broader benefits of rising productivity and a growing economy.”
10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“Gun control laws only restrict access to responsible gun ownership. High risk individuals will still be able to acquire firearms even with an increase in prevention.

10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“As more Americans abandon organized religion, many of the newly secular are unsympathetic to subsidizing religion via the tax code… Perhaps the most egregious example of religious privilege under the tax code is the so-called parsonage exemption. Under current tax law, ‘ministers of the gospel’ may deduct virtually all costs associated with housing from their income. At its worst, the exemption subsidizes the unseemly: televangelists enjoying multimillion-dollar estates on the taxpayer dime. But even in a more ordinary context, the allowance represents an indefensible benefit running to organized religion, subsidized by taxpayers. Another gratuity to churches is the real estate tax exemption, which denies cash-strapped municipalities revenue that could be used for public safety, road repairs and other services. Like everyone else in town, churches benefit from services provided by municipal governments, but in most areas are exempt from property taxation simply because they are churches… As we reassess religious privilege in America, even the notion of having churches pay income taxes should be on the table.”
10	Is Poor Representation by Public Defense Attorneys a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""In 1995, when New York enacted legislation allowing for the imposition of capital punishment in certain cases, the State simultaneously enacted legislation addressing the need for competent counsel in these cases. New York Judiciary Law Section 35-b creates a Capital Defender Office with several responsibilities including: serving as counsel for defendants when appointed by the court; furnishing legal advice, investigative, expert and other services; and providing training to attorneys appointed to represent capital defendants…  Ultimately, the integrity of our criminal justice system rests on the assurance that capital defendants have competent counsel. In New York, we have created a program to ensure this, and every state should adopt a program which addresses this critical need…  Many states have programs with different details which also adequately ensure competent counsel."""
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Contrary to what one might read in newspapers, the science of climate change is strong. Our own work and the immense body of independent research conducted around the world leaves no doubt… There is no question that natural causes, such as changes in energy from the sun, natural cycles and volcanoes, continue to affect temperature today… But despite years of intensive observations of the Earth system, no one has been able to propose a credible alternative mechanism that can explain the present-day warming without heat-trapping gases produced by human activities… [H]umans have taken over from nature as the dominant influence on our climate.”
01	Is There a Legal Right to Die?	"""The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The exercise of this right is as central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity as rights safeguarded by this Court's decisions relating to marriage, family relationships, procreation, contraception, child rearing and the refusal or termination of life-saving medical treatment. In particular, this Court's recent decisions concerning the right to refuse medical treatment and the right to abortion instruct that a mentally competent, terminally ill person has a protected liberty interest in choosing to end intolerable suffering by bringing about his or her own death.  A state's categorical ban on physician assistance to suicide -- as applied to competent, terminally ill patients who wish to avoid unendurable pain and hasten inevitable death -- substantially interferes with this protected liberty interest and cannot be sustained."""

10	Should Baseball Players Who Have Used Banned Substances Be Voted into the Hall of Fame?	"""The Hall was supposed to be for playing accomplishments only, but now we have the electorate judging character. And in that case there are a lot of players who should come out of the Hall. How about the bad apples like Ty Cobb? And there are likely racist owners and managers in the Hall as well–should they be?   That's a larger issue. But here's a way to deal with the steroid users: Have everyone take a polygraph test. If you fail, you're out; and publish the results. Then we'll see how many players want to get into the Hall.  Otherwise, if Barry Bonds gets in, then Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Pudge Rodriguez and Rafael Palmiero and anyone else who has credentials has to get in. And if these guys get in under the suspicion that they cheated the game and their ability, then is betting on games the way Pete Rose did really that bad in comparison? Pete bet on his Reds to win depending on who was pitching, but the steroid freaks benefited from the effects of their drugs every game."""

But here is what should bother you about these expensive homes: You are helping to pay for them! You pay for them indirectly, the same way local, state, and federal governments in the United States subsidize religion—to the tune of about $71 billion every year… Hypothetically, the leader of a drug cartel could have one of his lieutenants start a church and file for tax-exempt status. Once granted, money from the sale of drugs could then be donated to the religion, which could use the funds to build extravagant buildings (including a ‘parsonage’), host extravagant ‘services’ (a.k.a. parties) for members of the religion, and pay extravagant salaries to its ministers (including the leader of the cartel). Drug money could be laundered through the church’s bank accounts with little risk of being caught by authorities. If drug cartels and the Mafia aren’t already doing this, we’d be surprised… [A]s the perceived ‘benefit’ to society of religions becomes increasingly irrelevant as more and more Americans cease to utilize their ‘services’ by disaffiliating, it will also be increasingly unfair for a large percentage of nonreligious Americans (almost 40 percent in some states) to subsidize the recreational activities of others.

10	Does Marijuana Use Permanently Damage the Human Brain?	experts now admit that pot doesn’t kill brain cells. This myth came from a handful of animal experiments in which structural changes (not actual cell death, as is often alleged) were observed in brain cells of animals exposed to high doses of pot. Many critics still cite the notorious monkey studies of Dr. Robert G. Heath, which purported to find brain damage in three monkeys that had been heavily dosed with cannabis. This work was never replicated and has since been discredited by a pair of better controlled, much larger monkey studies, one by Dr. William Slikker of the National Center for Toxicological Research [William Slikker et al., ‘Chronic Marijuana Smoke Exposure in the Rhesus Monkey,’ Fundamental and Applied Toxicology 17: 321-32 (1991)] and the other by Charles Rebert and Gordon Pryor of SRI International [Charles Rebert & Gordon Pryor – ‘Chronic Inhalation of Marijuana Smoke and Brain Electrophysiology of Rhesus Monkeys,’ International Journal of Psychophysiology V 14, p.144, 1993]. Neither found any evidence of physical alteration in the brains of monkeys exposed to daily doses of pot for up to a year. Human studies of heavy users in Jamaica and Costa Rica found no evidence of abnormalities in brain physiology. Even though there is no evidence that pot causes permanent brain damage, users should be aware that persistent deficits in short-term memory have been noted in chronic, heavy marijuana smokers after 6 to 12 weeks of abstinence. It is worth noting that other drugs, including alcohol, are known to cause brain damage.”

As soon as he interprets the animal’s motivation he is applying human psychodynamics — a risky, if not foolhardy scientific approach. Secondly, assumptions as to the origin of human homosexuality cannot be based on the study of genes, hypothalamus, anterior commissure, or the lower brain structures, or species such as the drosophila fly, or even lower primates; because in man the enormous evolutionary development of the cerebral cortex has made motivation — both conscious and unconscious — of overwhelming central significance in sexual patterning and sexual-object choice.

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“[F]or the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, the ‘establishment’ of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity… The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship, since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches, but simply abstains from demanding that the church support the state. No one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees ‘on the public payroll.’ There is no genuine nexus between tax exemption and establishment of religion… The exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less than taxation of churches. It restricts the fiscal relationship between church and state, and tends to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other… Nothing in this national attitude toward religious tolerance and two centuries of uninterrupted freedom from taxation has given the remotest sign of leading to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, it has operated affirmatively to help guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief. Thus, it is hardly useful to suggest that tax exemption is but the ‘foot in the door’ or the ‘nose of the camel in the tent’ leading to an established church.”

01	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""The right of a competent, terminally ill person to avoid excruciating pain and embrace a timely and dignified death bears the sanction of history and is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The exercise of this right is as central to personal autonomy and bodily integrity as rights safeguarded by this Court's decisions relating to marriage, family relationships, procreation, contraception, child rearing and the refusal or termination of life-saving medical treatment. In particular, this Court's recent decisions concerning the right to refuse medical treatment and the right to abortion instruct that a mentally competent, terminally ill person has a protected liberty interest in choosing to end intolerable suffering by bringing about his or her own death.   A state's categorical ban on physician assistance to suicide -- as applied to competent, terminally ill patients who wish to avoid unendurable pain and hasten inevitable death -- substantially interferes with this protected liberty interest and cannot be sustained."""
10	Is the United States a Christian Nation?	"""When people tell me that we are or have been a Christian nation, I want to ask, 'When?' Was it in the colonial era or during westward expansion, when we began stealing the lands of the Native Americans, making and breaking treaties, killing wantonly, and justifying our actions by the Bible? Was it in the era of slavery or segregation, when again, we used the Bible to justify the unjustifiable? Was it in more recent history, when we dropped the first nuclear bomb and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, when we overthrew democratically elected governments in the Cold War era, when we plundered the environment without concern for the birds of the air or flowers of the field, or when we sanctioned or turned a blind eye to torture earlier this decade? Was it earlier this week, when I turned on the TV or radio and heard people scapegoating immigrants and gay people and Muslims?...

10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Suppose Congress created a legally enforceable right to health care… The first difficulty would be to define the scope of that right. Do we have a right to preventive care? If so, health care spending (and taxes) would explode…With the wide variety of tests and treatments, someone must decide where the right to health care ends, lest the nation be bankrupted. Whoever makes those decisions will wield enormous power over people’s health. Who should have that power? Most nations hand that power to unelected bureaucrats, who ration medical care — often by making even seriously ill patients wait for care. A second and related difficulty is the question of who pays. By definition, a right to health care could not be conditioned on ability to pay. Delivering on that right would require additional taxes proportionate to the scope of that right. A third difficulty is the incentives created by a right to health care. Patients would demand far more medical care because additional consumption would cost them little. Higher tax rates would discourage work and productivity, yielding less economic growth and wealth… A fourth difficulty is how to deliver all this medical care. Declaring health care to be a right does nothing to solve the problem of getting the right resources to the right place at the right time… The fundamental problem with the idea of a right to health care is that it turns the idea of individual rights on its head. Individual rights don’t infringe on the rights of others… A right to health care, however, says that Smith has a right to Jones’ labor… The underlying goal of a legally enforceable right to health care is to provide quality medical care to the greatest number possible. Perversely, making health care a ‘right’ would make that goal harder to attain.”
10	Should the US Congress Be Involved in Setting Drug Policies for Professional Sports?	"""Although performance-enhancing drugs may be hazardous to health, the decision to use them should be left to the individual, not the state. Private companies and sports associations can prohibit the use of performance-enhancing drugs because people have the choice to accept or reject the rules. Statewide prohibition, however, makes the use of performance-enhancing drugs a social problem rather than an individual choice. Moreover, prohibition will not prevent the use of drugs. As long as people want to use performance-enhancing drugs, someone will produce and sell them...  Private companies and associations should be able to define what rules will govern them without any intervention from politicians. A private association has no obligation to accept me if I don't agree to their rules, just as I should not be forced to join any associations I don't think are fit for me. This logic should also prevail when it comes to the sale and use of steroids. If a group of people, let's say Bodybuilders and Co., think performance-enhancing drugs are OK, they should be left alone if they don't force anybody to follow their path. Sadly, this is not how things are done. Today, the debate about steroid use is widely dominated by morally superior do-gooders who believe it's not right for an athlete to use products that help him or her perform better."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Quite simply, the research just hasn’t panned out. For one thing, even while video game sales have skyrocketed, youth violence plummeted to its lowest levels in 40 years according to government statistics. Secondly, it has been increasingly recognized that much of the early research on violent video games linking them to increased aggression was problematic: most studies used outcome measures that had nothing to do with real-life aggression and failed to control carefully for other important variables, such as family violence, mental health issues or even gender in many studies (boys both play more violent video games and are more aggressive). More recent research has not found that children who play violent video games are more violent than other kids, nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion. A recent longitudinal study of my own, following 165 10- to 14-year-old boys and girls over a three-year period, now in press with Journal of Psychiatric Research, finds no long-term link between violent video games and youth aggression or dating violence.”

It violates the right to liberty and security, and the prohibition of slavery, of forced labor and of trafficking in persons because millions of women and girls all over the world are held in sexual slavery to meet the demand of even more millions of male buyers of sex, and to generate profits for the capitalists of sex.

01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“Drones kill fewer civilians, as a percentage of total fatalities, than any other military weapon. They’re the worst form of warfare in the history of the world, except for all the others… You can fly them low without fear of losing your life. You can study your target carefully instead of reacting in the heat of the moment. You can watch and guide the missiles all the way down. Even the substitution of missiles for bombs saves lives. Look at the data from Iraq: In incidents that claimed civilian lives, the weapon with the highest body count per incident was suicide bombing. The second most deadly weapon was aerial bombing by coalition forces. By comparison, missile strikes killed fewer than half as many civilians per error. Drones kill a lower ratio of civilians to combatants than we’ve seen in any recent war. Granted, many civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other such wars were killed by our enemies rather than by us. But that’s part of the equation. One reason to prefer drones is that when you send troops, fighting breaks out, and the longer the fighting goes on, the more innocent people die. Drones are like laparoscopic surgery: They minimize the entry wound and the risk of infection.”

01	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""Why should state and local governments cooperate with federal immigration officials?  Cooperation with federal immigration officials promotes public safety. State and local law enforcement are often on the front lines in dealing with crime involving transnational gang activity, human trafficking, smuggling, drug related offenses, and other serious crimes often tied to illegal immigration. When state and local law enforcement fail to contact federal immigration officials, criminal aliens are able to reenter communities and engage in further criminal activity at the expense and safety of citizens and lawful aliens…   ICE has roughly 20,000 officials and only 6,000 of these officials are active in enforcing immigration law in the interior of the country. That means, given current estimates, illegal aliens outnumber ICE agents by 2,000 to 1. Thus, the cooperation and assistance of over 900,000 state and local law enforcement agents currently working in our country allows immigration enforcement to operate much more efficiently and as intended by Congress. Without such cooperation, ICE officials alone can only hope to make small dents in the country’s vast illegal alien population."""

Our nation's legacy of slavery and racial injustice find continued offense in our use of the death penalty. Our death row population is more than 40% black -- nearly three times the proportion of the general population.  Reforming our criminal justice system to save and redeem more lives is not as simple as changing just one thing. But we should be able to admit that we must do more of what works to save lives, and we should stop doing things that do not work.   As a prosecutor, I saw that the death penalty's racial legacy could not be excused or explained away -- and that too many innocent lives were being taken by this profoundly flawed practice.  So I decided to fight for the death penalty's repeal."""

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	The value of gold fluctuates widely and would not provide the price stability necessary for a healthy economy. Between 1879 and 1933, when the United States was on a full gold standard, the inflation adjusted market price of gold fluctuated from the $700 range (1890s) to the $200 range (1920s). From 1934-1970, when the US was on a partial gold standard, the inflation adjusted price of gold went from $563 to $201. [36] In 1980, the inflation adjusted price of gold was $2,337, much higher than than today's price of $1,672 per ounce (Dec. 19, 2012). [37] Fluctuations like these would be damaging to a gold standard economy, since the value of a dollar would be attached to the value of gold. For example, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of gold would eventually result in a 10% rise or fall in the overall price level of goods across the country - such fluctuations would destabilize the economy.

01	Should Net Neutrality Be Restored? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Net neutrality protects consumers by preventing ISPs from speeding, slowing, or charging higher fees for select online content. Allowing ISPs to speed or slow certain websites, or charge fees for fast lane access, may eventually trickle down to consumers in the form of higher internet costs. For example, a person who gets their internet service from Comcast could be charged extra fees to stream Netflix or Amazon (companies not owned by Comcast), while not being charged extra to stream NBC or Hulu (two companies that Comcast partially owns). [21] According to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), without net neutrality, ISPs could ""cabel-ize"" the internet, meaning that ""instead of paying a flat price for access to use any app or service free of charge, companies could start bundling services into 'social,' 'video,' and so on,"" and consumers will have to pay for it. [23] On Apr. 27, 2017, one day after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced the plan to eliminate net neutrality, Comcast (the largest US ISP) removed it's pledge to not ""prioritize internet traffic or create paid fast lanes"" from its corporate website.

10	Would Improving Palliative Care Decrease Patient Requests for Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Assisting death in no way precludes giving the best palliative care possible but rather integrates compassionate care and respect for the patient's autonomy and ultimately makes death with dignity a real option...   The evidence for the emotional impact of assisted dying on physicians shows that euthanasia and assisted suicide are a far cry from being 'easier options for the caregiver' than palliative care, as some critics of Dutch practice have suggested. We wish to take a strong stand against the separation and opposition between euthanasia and assisted suicide, on the one hand, and palliative care, on the other, that such critics have implied. There is no 'either-or' with respect to these options. Every appropriate palliative option available must be discussed with the patient and, if reasonable, tried before a request for assisted death can be accepted...  Opposing euthanasia to palliative care...neither reflects the Dutch reality that palliative medicine is incorporated within end-of-life care nor the place of the option of assisted death at the request of a patient within the overall spectrum of end-of-life care."""
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Video games that portray violence against women lead to more harmful attitudes and sexually violent actions towards women. A 2012 peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence found that video games that sexually objectify women and feature violence against women led to a statistically significant increase in rape-supportive attitudes, which are attitudes that are hostile towards rape victims. [68] A 1998 peer-reviewed study found that 21% of games sampled involved violence against women, while 28% portrayed them as sex objects. [23] Exposure to sexual violence in video games is linked to increases in violence towards women and false attitudes about rape, such as that women incite men to rape or that women secretly desire rape. [30] Carole Lieberman, MD, a media psychiatrist, stated, ""The more video games a person plays that have violent sexual content, the more likely one is to become desensitized to violent sexual acts and commit them.""

10	Is Drinking Milk a Good Way to Build Strong Bones?	"""Calcium intake, turnover, and absorption and excretion rates determine the availability of calcium for bone growth and development [referred to as the calcium balance]... Factors that affect calcium balance, including dietary calcium intake, likely play a role in bone development... Dairy products contain nutrients, including protein, sodium, and in some cases, supplemental vitamin D, all of which influence calcium balance and bone mineralization and alter or negate the effect of dairy calcium in the body's mineral economy. Animal protein and sodium, in particular, tend to increase calcium excretion...  Increases in dairy or total dietary calcium intake (>400-500 mg/day) are not correlated with or a predictor of BMD [bone mineral density] or fracture rate in children and adolescents. We found no evidence to support the notion that milk is a preferred source of calcium...  Available evidence does not support nutritional guidelines focused specifically on increasing milk or other dairy product intake for promoting child and adolescent bone mineralization."""
01	Do Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide Ensure a Good Death?	"""One last good consequence of legalizing euthanasia is that once death has been accepted, it is often more humane to end life quickly and peacefully, when that is what the patient wants.

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“The greatest barrier to public recognition of human-made climate change is probably the natural variability of local climate… Actions to stem emissions of the gases that cause global warming are unlikely to approach what is needed until the public recognizes that human-made climate change is underway and perceives that it will have unacceptable consequences… Recent high profile heat waves, such as the one in Texas and Oklahoma in the summer of 2011, raise the question of whether these extreme events are related to the on-going global warming trend, which has been attributed with a high degree of confidence to human-made greenhouse gases… The increase of these extreme anomalies, by more than an order of magnitude, implies that we can say with a high degree of confidence that events such as the extreme summer heat in the Moscow region in 2010 and Texas in 2011 were a consequence of global warming… There are many other human-induced stresses on life… yet global warming caused by fossil fuel burning may be a unique threat because of the millennial time scale of anthropogenic carbon within surface carbon reservoirs. It has been argued that a scenario phasing out carbon emissions fast enough to stabilize climate this century, limiting further warming to a maximum of several tenths of a degree Celsius, is still possible, but it would require a rising price on carbon emissions sufficient to spur transition to a clean energy future without burning all fossil fuels.”

01	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“[W]e need economic policies that incentivize firms and entrepreneurs to take risks by expanding and hiring. We can start by reducing and modernizing the corporate tax rate system… To gauge the impact of a lower corporate income tax rate, Milken Institute economists evaluated the likely effect of a cut in the top U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 to 22 percent, with the reduction phased in over a five-year period beginning next year. This new rate, which would match the current OECD average, would provide a substantial boost to economic growth… Lower corporate tax rates will lead to higher levels of domestic investment and a greater accumulation of productive capital. Having more capital stock available per worker augments productivity and improves long-run economic growth, leading to more jobs and a higher standard of living for those workers. Industries exporting a greater share of the goods and services that they produce pay higher wages than those that don’t. As exports rise from an improved competitive position, good middle-class jobs are created.”

Tenure does not guarantee lifetime employment. It does not protect the unqualified or incompetent individual. The most important function of tenure is to provide a due process when questions arise about a teacher’s qualifications, ability or suitability to teach… Evidence of effectiveness, demonstrated over a period of three years, lies at the heart of the tenure process. That process is sound, but it is only as good as the people charged with the responsibility of carrying it out. During the three year probationary period, administrators have ample opportunity to closely monitor and evaluate a teacher’s performance. Diligence is required on the part of principals and supervisors… Teacher tenure is a vital protection, and a key professional right. The Louisiana Federation of Teachers will vigorously fight any efforts to water down the state’s tenure law. We will wage this battle in the context of our call for a bolder, broader approach to public education.”
10	Is Obamacare Leading to a Decline in Employment-Based Health Insurance? - DEBATED	"""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) does not eliminate the system's reliance on employment-based health insurance. Instead, it builds on, and arguably strengthens, the employment-based system... Health care in the United States has long been financed principally through employment-based health insurance. At least in the short run, the PPACA is unlikely to disturb that balance. PPACA's incentives with respect to employment-based health insurance are unlikely to change significantly the number of employers who elect to offer employment-based health insurance. The penalty under the large employer pay-or-play mandate, though low relative to the cost of health insurance premiums, is unlikely to affect employers' willingness to offer health insurance, at least in the short run. The small employer tax credit may encourage some employers that do not already offer health insurance to offer health insurance."""

In conjunction with well-publicized production and election schedules, the universal availability of DRE code would irresponsibly provide potential wrongdoers with ready access to important tools used to safeguard American democracy."""
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“One of the chief reasons for the teachers’ unions in the first place was to protect teachers from outside pressure through tenure. Tenure is not easily given; it is earned. Moreover, critics of teachers’ unions do not take into account the fact that teaching is labor-intensive and teachers often burn out. Teachers are not the problem of American education, as some charge; they are the solution.”
10	Does Illegal Immigration Disadvantage American Workers?	"""It might seems like a no-brainer that increased immigration [legal and illegal] would reduce the wages of native-born Americans. A simple supply and demand model would tell you that more workers means lower wages. But the story is actually more complicated than that. According to a 2010 survey of the economic literature, the Brookings Institute concluded that, 'The most recent academic research suggests that, on average, immigrants raise the over standard of living of American workers by boosting wages and lowering prices.'   How can it be that more workers competing over the same jobs can lead to higher wages? The reason is that it's now actually more workers competing over the same jobs. Immigration actually changes what jobs employers need to fill. For one, an influx of cheap labor can make certain businesses like farming or restaurants feasible. (Absent cheap labor, these firms simply could not compete with foreign rivals.) Second, immigrants not only supply labor, but demand it, too. And a larger domestic population through immigration creates more potential customers for businesses as well."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Raising the minimum wage does not increase the value of the worker’s labor. It increases the cost of the worker’s labor. And as everyone knows, the more something costs, the less of it we buy… In a bizarre twist, raising the minimum wage hurts the very people it aims to help. As detailed in a forthcoming paper to be published by the Mercatus Center, national employment data from 1975 through 2012 show that on average, a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage has been followed by no change in employment among college-educated workers, a half-percentage point increase in unemployment for those with high school diplomas, and a one percentage point increase in unemployment for those without high school diplomas. Young people who have yet to finish high school are hit hardest of all. They have to contend with a two percentage point increase in unemployment, and as a result many are unable to find summer employment – employment that would help them acquire the skills to find better work in the future. This is what happens when economics takes a back seat to political considerations. The feel-good rhetoric of increasing the minimum wage outweighs the economic reality that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Every cost must be paid by someone, and those who will pay for a minimum wage hike are the very people we are trying to help.”
10	Election Day National Holiday - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Making Election Day a national holiday will disadvantage low-income and blue collar workers. Federal law doesn’t require private employers to give employees paid federal holidays. [20][21][22] A part-time hourly worker is more likely to have multiple jobs, none of which are likely to offer time off for a national holiday. [23] Annie McDonald, Editor of the Berkeley Public Policy Journal, noted that the workers who are least likely to get paid holidays are those who already have less of a voice in the political process: ""Americans working in retail, hospitality, and service jobs, for example, would most likely not receive the benefit of a paid holiday to vote. In fact, these voters may be more likely to have to work as a result of a federal election holiday, where they may have had time off previously on a random Tuesday in November. Additionally, many of these individuals rely on school days as childcare for their children. An additional day off school would prove to be problematic for individuals who may not have other readily accessible forms of childcare.” [24] People who have already suffered significant disenfranchisement, such as women and people of color, are more likely to be working those low-income jobs that wouldn’t get the time off to vote even on a national holiday. [24] Holidays usually mean more work hours for retail workers, because stores run promotions and sales. [25]"

Treatment was also shown to cause a statistically significant rise in patients’ weight after 3 months of treatment, and improvement in clinical disease activity index in patients with CD… Moreover, the data demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in almost all aspects of patients’ daily life. After 3 months’ treatment with inhaled cannabis, patients stated an improvement in their health status, their ability to perform daily activities and their ability to maintain social life. Patients reported a statistically significant physical pain reduction during treatment, as well as improvement in mental distress… None of our patients complained of any side effect that disturbed their working ability. In fact, as was shown in the results, there was a statistically significant improvement in patients’ ability to work after treatment.”

01	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""Careful measurements have confirmed that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing and that human activities (principally, the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use) are the primary cause. Human activities have caused the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to be higher today than at any point during the last 650,000 years. Scientists agree it is very likely that most of the global average warming since the mid-20th century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gases, rather than to natural causes...  Natural variations within the Earth's climate system can cause small changes over decades to centuries... However, while natural variations have altered the climate significantly in the past, it is very unlikely that the changes in climate observed since the mid-20th century can be explained by natural processes alone."""

The Palestinians too must have a national home of their own, living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. It serves Israel's and America's interests, and it is right and just.  Israel must choose among three things: being a Jewish homeland, remaining democratic and maintaining control over all the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. It can only have two — it can only be both Jewish and democratic by giving up the land on which a Palestinian state can be built in exchange for peace.  For too long, pro-Israel advocacy has defined this conflict in zero-sum terms, as 'us versus them,' a conflict in which there can be only one winner. But being pro-Israel doesn't require an 'anti.' Israel's long-term security actually depends on fulfilling the aspirations of the Palestinian people through a two-state solution."""
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	OTC birth control could lower the rate of unintended pregnancies, saving taxpayers billions of dollars. 54% of unintended pregnancies are associated with not using contraceptives and 41% with inconsistent use. [1] Unintended pregnancies cost the US federal and state governments $21 billion in 2010, the newest numbers available at the time of publication, with the average cost-per-birth being $12,770 for prenatal care, labor and delivery, postpartum care, and 12 months of infant care ($20,716 for 60 months). [17] The Guttmacher Institute estimates that $15.5 billion dollars could have been saved if the unintended pregnancies had been prevented. [17] Only 5% of unintended pregnancies have happened while the woman used effective birth control consistently. [1] A study found that women who received a one-year supply of Pills were 30% less likely to have an unplanned pregnancy and 46% less likely to have an abortion. [18] A study comparing Pill use between women who obtained Pills with a prescription from an El Paso, Texas, clinic and women who obtained Pills OTC from Mexico showed that the women who got Pills OTC were more likely to continuously use the medication.

01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“As the 1980s recede into history, three achievements of Ronald Reagan loom larger. In a time of dangerous drift and malaise, he restored Americans’ sense of self-confidence and greatness. He transmuted American conservatism from theory to practice, undermined the intellectual pretensions of long-regnant liberalism, and decisively shifted the paradigm of political discourse for the rest of the 20th century. Above all, he mobilized the resources — rhetorical, military, and diplomatic — that put Soviet communism on the road to extinction. As time passes, Reagan’s stature rises — a sure sign that he will be remembered as one of our most successful and important presidents.”

While increasing our national security is critical, restricting driver licenses (DLs) is an inefficient way to enforce immigration laws and prevent terrorism... Furthermore, press accounts since September 11 have called attention to the fact that the hijackers had obtained DLs when, in fact, the terrorists did not need U.S.-issued DLs to board the planes on September 11; they had foreign passports that allowed them to board.  In fact, denying driving licenses to large segments of the population makes everyone in the community less safe.

01	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“As the Internet increasingly takes over different facets of life, it stands to reason that traditional educational methods are in line for a shake-up. Printed textbook information is static, the books are heavy, they’re costly, and they quickly become outdated. Seeing this, textbook manufacturers have moved to producing digital textbooks packed with interactive features, lightweight (or the weight of a student’s mobile device), lower cost, and easily updated with the latest and greatest information… One positive of digital textbooks is undoubtedly their price tag. Digital textbooks eliminate the cost of replacing print textbooks every few years, since new content can be uploaded anytime. Additionally, schools can give students access to open-source educational resources-wells of information free for anyone to use. Possibly the most impactful effects digital textbooks have had are on learning itself. Print textbooks have immutable information, small margins, and lack engaging characteristics. Some newly developed digital counterparts, however, such as Apple’s iPad textbooks, encourage a personalized learning experience… They invite students to create learning environments that, though standardized on one level, are, on another, uniquely theirs.”
10	Does Drinking Milk Inhibit Iron Absorption and Contribute to Anemia?	"""This study was designed to compare the effect of milk...on the bioavailability of iron in young women, a population group at risk for iron deficiency because of menstrual-blood losses...

Only subject 23 absorbed more iron from the diet without milk. However, the difference between the two treatments was not significant...  In summary, the results of this study suggest that the addition of milk to cereal-based diets does not affect iron absorption sufficiently to improve iron nutriture, as in vitro [outside an organism] tests suggest it might. Neither does the addition of milk to cereal-based diets inhibit iron absorption."""
10	Saturday Halloween - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Moving Halloween would ignore the holiday's ancient and religious traditions. The origins of Halloween have religious and cultural importance, tracing back 2,000 years to the pagan festival Samhain (pronounced ""sow-in""), in which the ancient Celts celebrated the end of summer from sunset on Oct. 31 to sunset on Nov. 1. [27][28] They believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth, blurring the boundary between the living and dead. Around 43 AD, the Romans, who were then ruling the Celtic territory, combined their Feralia festival honoring the dead with the Samhain activities. [27] The Catholic church has observed All Saints' Day (also known as All Hallows or Hallowmas) on Nov. 1 since the mid-eighth century. Halloween, originally ""All Hallows’ Eve"" or ""Vigil or Eve of All Hallows"" therefore takes place the day before, on Oct. 31. [27][29]"

10	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""The 14th Amendment says nothing about birthright citizenship. It just doesn't. As I say, Brother Levin made the point exquisitely last night. They want the Constitution to say that. They want people to believe the Constitution says that if you are born to an illegal alien mother, that you are automatically an American citizen. They want to insist that that's what the Constitution says, but it doesn't. And again a reminder, the Supreme Court has never ruled that the children of illegal aliens are American citizens. The Supreme Court has only granted citizenship to the children born to legal immigrants, not illegal. Who in their right mind ever thought that the birth of a child to an illegal immigrant converted to citizenship? A lot of people believe it. It's not in the 14th Amendment…  I can imagine that many of you hearing me say this think I have to be wrong. Maybe, you know, I'm well-intentioned and you know I'm not lying to you, but maybe I'm wrong because everybody knows that if you're born in America, you are a citizen. No, you're not. Now, clearly the invaders think so. It's one of the reasons they're coming. They come pregnant, they give birth, they think automatically there is citizenship involved. So that's one thing to straighten out. And as I say, the truth here happens to be perceived by a lot of people as the extreme position, when all it is is a literal interpretation of the Constitution."""

"""Milk contains fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and diets high in fat and saturated fat can increase the risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease...  Organic milk may not contain the pesticides and antibiotics that non-organic milk contains, but still can be loaded with fat and cholesterol. Even organic cow's milk, which does not contain artificial hormones, does contain naturally occurring hormones. The combination of nutrients found in both organic and non-organic cow's milk increases our own production of some types of hormones. These hormones have been shown to increase the risk of some forms of cancer. Soymilk and other non-dairy beverages, such as rice and nut milks, are healthy alternatives to cow's milk."""
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Executions should be banned by act of Congress for this simple reason: Experience has shown that the death penalty doesn't serve the cause of justice… How likely is it, really, that a killer will be more deterred by the risk of the death penalty than by having to spend the rest of his life in prison? The claim fails the test of common sense. Criminologists and police chiefs say the death penalty just doesn't influence murderers -- partly because its application is so haphazard… It's true that the purpose of punishment is not only deterrence but also retribution. But this doesn't justify the popular view that killers should be killed, any more than it would support the idea that rapists should be raped or thieves stolen from. To be just, retribution must be measured and restrained. That's the difference between justice and revenge…   The extraordinary crimes that would justify the death penalty are difficult to imagine, much less define, before the fact. And, even in exceptional cases, the requirement to prove guilt beyond any doubt is hard to satisfy. (What does ‘beyond any doubt’ actually mean? Is a psychopath guilty beyond any doubt?) Let's allow that it would have been right to execute Hitler. But let's also recognize that restricting the death penalty to the few cases where it would be both just and safe is impractical. The best pragmatic course is not to use the death penalty more sparingly but to abolish it outright."""

My objective is that given the Hippocratic Oath, I'm not going against it, I'm helping people, people like my daughter [Emily, who died at 25 after a 17-year battle with leukemia] who need help at the end of their lives.

01	Is Prostitution Immoral and Demeaning?	"""A few years ago, prostitutes disappeared from the pages of medical journals; they returned as 'sex workers.' Nor did they work in prostitution any more: they were employees in the 'sex industry.' Presumably, orgasms are now a consumer product just like any other. As for pimps, the correct term is probably: 'brief sexual liaison coordinators'...  The idea of the state coercing its population into prostitution is, of course, repellent. Even the most liberal of liberals would probably agree with that. This means that there is after all a moral difference between prostitution and washing dishes in the local restaurant or stacking supermarket shelves. And that prostitution is both age-old and ineradicable does not make it any less degrading to all concerned.   Once again, the attempt to remake our moral universe by a change of terminology stands revealed as shallow moral exhibitionism."""
10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“The now-familiar objection to a tax increase on corporate profits is that it will discourage private investment and thus dampen job creation. The retort is just as obvious: since when have tax cuts on corporate profits led to increased investment, faster job creation and higher per capita consumption out of rising real wages? It didn’t happen after the Reagan Revolution, it didn’t happen during the Clinton boom of the 1990s, and it sure didn’t happen under George W. Bush. Nor is it happening now, as corporate profits soar and full-time job creation languishes. American corporations are now sitting on $4.75 trillion in cash, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The other well-worn objection to an increase of corporate income taxes is that it would encourage companies to invest and hire overseas, where tax rates are presumably lower. Here, too, the retort is obvious: the tax code already works exactly this way by postponing taxes until profits from investment overseas are repatriated. American companies routinely avoid taxation by moving their idle cash offshore.”
01	Is Pornography Prostitution?	"""Pornography is a form of prostitution i.e. women are paid to have sexual practices carried out on and in their bodies. Even in those countries where brothel prostitution is illegal such as the US, prostitution is legal if it is for pornography. This legal form of prostitution has created a foundation for demand the decriminalisation of other forms of the prostitution industry. In my state of Victoria the porn industry was an important force in legalisation of brothels in 1984 and now the brothels advertise and sell their women at the Sexpos. It is important to understand that porn is prostitution and brothel prostitution is able to become more respectable as the industry develops its strength, and political influence.  Presently there is an international campaign to decriminalise the prostitution industry. Lobbyists financed by the international sex industry and AIDS money work in South Africa, UK, Eastern Europe to create a profitable and legal brothel prostitution industry. Pornography leads the way, softening up attitudes to the sexual exploitation of women, and building the profits and political clout of sex industrialists who sought to diversify their interests into all forms of prostitution."""

Previous versions of the whereabouts worked nearly on a 24/7 basis. It is acknowledged that this is simply not possible and fair on the athletes. The option finally chosen by WADA of a 60 minute testing window for each day, is supported by the IAAF and we feel a good compromise between athletes providing no or very little whereabouts information, and having to provide 24/7 details...  As of today, any serious anti-doping programme cannot even begin to suggest that athletes could have many weeks (let alone days) away, free in the knowledge they cannot be tested...

"""Electronic voting raised President Bush's advantage from the tiny edge he held in 2000 to a clearer margin of victory in 2004. The impact of e-voting was not uniform, however. Its impact was proportional to the Democratic support in the county, i.e., it was especially large in Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade. The evidence for this is the statistical significance of terms in our model that gauge the average impact of e-voting across Florida's 67 counties with statistical interaction effects that gauge its larger-than-average effect in counties where Vice President Gore did the best in 2000 and slightly negative effect in the counties where Mr. Bush did the best in 2000. The state-wide impact of these disparities due to electronic voting amount to 130,000 votes if we assume a 'ghost vote' mechanism and twice that - 260,000 votes if we assume that a vote misattributed to one candidate should have been counted for the other."""

Public schools already have dress codes which ban provocative, revealing, gang-affiliated, and hateful clothing, which addresses Rep. McKnight’s concerns in introducing the bill. Second, the bill would not mask income disparities, it would showcase them. The bill says that it would provide funding for at least five uniforms for a student who cannot afford one, depending on the availability of funding. What happens when this funding is not available anymore? And why would this be the best use of money on the school system? Wouldn’t it be better to fix the crippling inequality of schools along the I-95 corridor? Or invest in vocational training for our students? Rather than attempting to disguise poverty, shouldn’t we attempt to solve it and help these students and their families rise out of poverty?”
01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""Athletes are in a position to make a decision about what behavior is in their best interest, to weigh the risks and benefits according to their own values. And a paternalistic rule that attempts to prevent the athlete from harming himself runs counter to the important values of independence and personal choice. Moreover, it is likely that the feared harm is neither life-threatening nor irreversible. Presumably, under this health rationale, if performance is enhanced by substances that cause neither short-term nor long-term harm to the athlete, these substances should not be banned."""

10	Hosting the Olympic Games - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The Olympics force host cities to create expensive infrastructure and buildings that fall into disuse. Robert A. Baade, PhD, and Victor A. Matheson, PhD, Economic professors, stated, ""host cities are often left with specialized sports infrastructure that has little use beyond the Games"" and that the cities must maintain at great expense. [9] Many Olympic venues worldwide sit empty, rusted, overgrown with weeds, covered with graffiti, and filled with polluted water. [23] The $78 million Olympic Stadium in PyeongChang for the 2018 Winter Games was set for demolition before the 2018 Games even began. [24] Sydney's 2000 Olympic Stadium will be demolished in 2019 in favor of a smaller, more useful venue. [25] Bejing's 2008 Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium costs the city $11 million a year to maintain, and the stadium that seats 91,000 mostly sits unused. [26][27] In Rio de Janeiro, the $700 million athletes village for the 2016 Games was turned into luxury apartments that are now ""shuttered"" and the Olympic Park is ""basically vacant"" after failing to attract a buyer. [23][28] Sofia Sakorafa, Greece MP and former Olympian, stated of the 2004 Athens Games venues, ""We are left with installations that are rotting away because we don't even have the money to maintain them. A lot of entrepreneurs and property developers got rich very quickly."" [29]"
10	Could Electronic Voting Machine Software Be Programmed to Alter the Outcome of an Election?	"""[To] alter cast vote records as they are recorded for some desired outcome, malicious software code specific to a particular DRE must be written that shows the voter one outcome that records another...In order for the attacker to remain anonymous and/or perpetrate the attack, the malicious code must remain undetected or hidden.  The malicious code would need to overcome...thousands of different ballot styles in the electronic ballot definition, not including the differences in presentation created by languages or ballot rotation. While the presidential race appears as the first contest, the order of the candidates and the language used can change for different presentations of the ballot, requiring the malicious code to possess control over these functions.  A common claim is that the malicious code need only search for party name and make decisions on vote alteration based on these criteria. In the case of the eSlate [DRE manufactured by Hart InterCivic, Inc.], when instructed by ballot style to display the party name, the party name is converted to a graphic image...The point here is that the selection displayed to the voter has no reference to the party affiliation in the software code...[T]he malicious code becomes much more complex, thereby increasing its size.

01	Should Selling Sexual Acts Be Decriminalized but Buying Criminalized Such as in Sweden?	"""The Swedish regime is not simply a piece of ideological legislation, but a holistic approach to the problems of prostitution...   No increase in violence against women since the law was implemented has been reported from a majority of the police districts...   Although it is often argued that restrictions on street prostitution results in poor and drug addicted women losing their only source of income, there has been very little protest regarding this issue from opponents of the legislation. However, the Swedish government investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes and other exit strategies has undoubtedly enabled more women to leave prostitution. Some of the NGOs argue that a number of women have been inspired to leave by the new legislation.  Decriminalising the selling of sex has meant those in prostitution do not have to contend with harassment and arrest from police, which can enable the women to feel less stigmatised. Furthermore, this system serves to prevent the 'revolving door', and means that services can be explicitly directed at assisting women to leave prostitution, and with reintegration into society...   What emerged strongly from this review, even with the limitations of time and resources, is that most approaches to prostitution lack a coherent philosophical underpinning, from which specific short and longer term aims and objectives could be drawn out and evaluated.... The most coherent approach in terms of philosophy and implementation is that adopted by Sweden, and interestingly it is the only one where no one who sells sex is subject to the criminal law."""
01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""It will take at least three decades to completely leave behind fossil fuels. But we can do it...   But the transition will entail costs—not just money and regulation, but also changes in our behavior and expectations. It will probably take at least three or four decades, and will fundamentally change the way we live...  Nearly everyone agrees that the easiest way to kick-start the transition would be to replace coal with solar and wind power for electricity generation...  The collective weight of these challenges and opportunities suggests that a truly all-renewable economy may be very different from the American economy we know today. The renewable economy will likely be slower and more local; it will probably be a conserver economy rather than a consumer economy. It will also likely feature far less economic inequality."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The analysis seems to support the hypothesis that the rape rate could be lowered if prostitution was more readily available. This would be accomplished in most countries by its legalization. In the United States where prostitution is illegal, the low-end price for most prostitutes is about $200 and the monthly per capita income is $2,820. In Amsterdam, Netherlands where prostitution is legal the price is $30. If prostitution were legalized in the United States it is rational to assume that prices would resemble those in the Netherlands, this would result in...a decrease in the rape rate of 10 per 100,000. The population of the United States if roughly 275 million so this should result is a decrease of approximately 25,000 rapes per year."""
10	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""[P]lacing flavored milk back in schools would be in direct opposition to any actions taken to help students to achieve greater academic success. And, when we consider a normal school day, we aren't just talking about one serving. A child could have up to four servings... This amounts to a total of 88 grams of added sugar per day - 3.5 times that amount the World Health Organization recommends...  [M]any would argue that while flavored milk has some drawbacks, drinking milk has many health benefits, and children are more likely to drink milk if it is flavored. In fact, some flavored milk providers actually market their products to schools by claiming that it can be beneficial for building muscle after a rigorous workout, and by making a comparison between the amount of sugar in flavored milk versus soda. These arguments are shortsighted and don't make much sense, however.  First, sugar has been shown to reduce the body's ability to absorb calcium. Thus any health advantages of milk are actually negated once sugar is added. And, second, if the measure for health is just having less sugar that soda, then we can say just about anything is healthy. We must do better...  The [Los Angeles Unified School District] board needs to show wisdom and leadership here. Diminishing the health and well-being of our students by bringing back flavored milk is not displaying either."""

10	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""One source of added sugar that is a staple in school cafeterias is flavored milk. Promoting only unflavored milk is an effective way to reduce the added sugar children consume at school.  First, let's recognize the chocolate milk controversy for what it really is about: marketing. In 2010, the dairy industry's national marketing group, the Milk Processor Education Program, launched a $1 million initiative to promote chocolate milk, especially in schools (where most flavored milk is sold). The dairy industry claims that children will not drink unflavored milk -- adding sugar to it is necessary to ensure adequate calcium intake...  Flavored milk is not the nutritional equivalent of unflavored milk. It is significantly higher in calories, sugar, and sodium, and usually contains artificial colors and flavors. There are 11 grams (nearly three teaspoons) of added sugar in one cup of flavored milk...  Many may feel that flavored milk is being singled out in the debate over food/beverages served in schools. In fact, all over the country school districts have been revising their menus -- cutting out transfat, saturated fat and sugar in all its forms. Reducing sugar in school meals will help children avoid consuming excess discretionary calories, and flavored milk is one place to start."""

By contrast, the acts of alleged 'prostitution' in this case were not crimes independent of and apart from payment for the right to photograph the performance. The determination that pandering and prostitution occurred here was entirely dependent on the payment for the right to photograph. Indeed, under the People's theory the payment was used to establish not only the 'hiring' but also elements of both the 'pandering' (procuring) and the 'prostitution' (i.e., lewd acts 'for money'). When considered aside from the payment of the acting fees, itself fully lawful otherwise, the sexual acts depicted in the motion picture here were completely lawful.

Species differences exist in the process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated, and in the causes, progression, and outcome of diseases. As a result, for example, a mouse may develop cancer in the same location as a human, but they are not the same cancers… Non-animal methods are superior on all fronts: they are more efficient, accurate, and cost-effective than animal experiments.

10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“I am pro-life because abortion inhumanely kills children (including members of my own extended family), physically and psychologically harms their mothers, and emasculates their fathers by depriving them of their paternal identity and responsibilities without due process of law. It is poverty to say a child must die so that we may live as we wish. The undisputed scientific fact that human life begins at conception and the widely-held philosophic understanding that life is an undeserved gift from God and an inalienable right of every human being from our conception to our natural death forms the foundation of marriage and the human family, as well as the basis for the equal protection of the laws, the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United States Declaration of Independence, and the commitment in America’s Constitution to our ‘posterity.’ Over the past 44 years, one-sixth (60,000,000) of the American population has been killed by elective abortion. Twenty-five percent of African-Americans are killed in the womb. Abortion is the leading cause of death in America. Who in good conscience can be in favor of that? In Mother Teresa’s infamous words: ‘Any country that accepts such abortion on demand is the poorest of the poor.'”

"The Cuban government has consistently responded to US attempts to soften the embargo with acts of aggression, raising concerns about what would happen if the sanctions were fully lifted. President Carter tried to normalize relations with Cuba by opening the US Interests Section (a de facto embassy) in Havana in 1977. Fidel Castro then orchestrated the Mariel Boatlift, which sent 125,000 emigrants (including criminals and mentally ill people) to the United States. [27] [28] [29] In 2003, President George W. Bush began to ease restrictions for visiting family members in Cuba, but tightened the rules in 2004 in response to Cuba's crackdown against political dissidents. [4] President Obama relaxed the US travel policy in 2009 to allow unlimited travel to Cuba to visit family members. [8] That same year, the Cuban government arrested an American aid worker and sentenced him to 15 years in prison, and he was not released until Dec. 2014. [81] Since the United States agreed to re-open the US embassy in Cuba, the Cuban government has continued to persecute and arrest its own citizens. There were 630 political arrests in June 2015.

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	"Crime goes down when marijuana is legalized. Studies show that medical marijuana dispensaries decreased crime in their neighborhoods because of an increased security presence and more people walking around the area.

[36][35][23] The amount of crime and violence caused by alcohol use is ten times higher than by marijuana use and alcohol is a factor in around 40% of violent crimes. [33][32] A shift from drinking to cannabis use will decrease crimes associated with alcohol, such as domestic violence and assault. According to FBI crime statistics, violent crime in Washington decreased in the years after legalization (295.6 violent offenses reported per 100,000 Washington residents in 2011 vs. 284.4 violent offenses per 100,000 people in 2015). [31] Taylor West, former deputy director for the National Cannabis Industry Association, said, ""We're not seeing any increase in crime rates through marijuana — we're seeing lower crime rates, and there are good rational reasons for that: We're really beginning to cripple the criminal market, which is where violence actually occurs.""

10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Last week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan declared a war on paper textbooks. ‘Over the next few years,’ he said in a speech at the National Press Club, ‘textbooks should be obsolete.’ In their place would come a variety of digital-learning technologies, like e-readers and multimedia Web sites… Secretary Duncan is threatening to light a bonfire to a tried-and-true technology — good old paper — that has been the foundation for one of the great educational systems on the planet. And while e-readers and multimedia may seem appealing, the idea of replacing an effective learning platform with a widely hyped but still unproven one is extremely dangerous. …[D]igital-reading advocates claim that lightweight e-books benefit students’ backs and save schools money. But the rolling backpack seems to have solved the weight problem, and the astounding costs to outfit every student with an e-reader, provide technical support and pay for regular software updates promise to make the e-textbook a very pricey option. …With strength and durability that could last thousands of years, paper can preserve information without the troubles we find when our most cherished knowledge is stuck on an unreadable floppy disk or lost deep in the ‘cloud.’ Paper textbooks can be stored and easily referenced on a shelf. Data are as easy to retrieve from paper as reaching across your desk for a textbook. They are easy to read and don’t require a battery or plug. Though the iPad and e-readers have increasingly better screen clarity, the idea that every time a person reads a book, newspaper or magazine in the near future they will require an energy source is frightening. The digitization of information offers important benefits, including instant transmission, easy searchability and broad distribution. But before we shred the last of the paper textbooks, let us pause and remember those old streetcars, and how great it would be if we still had them around.”

"""First, temperature changes, as well as rates of temperature changes (both increase and decrease) of magnitudes similar to that reported by IPCC to have occurred since the Industrial revolution (about 0.8C in 150 years or even 0.4C in the last 35 years) have occurred in Earth's climatic history. There's nothing special about the recent rise!   Second, our ability to make realizable (or even sensible) future forecasts are greatly exaggerated relied upon by the IPCC. This is true both for the numerical modeling efforts (the same models that yield abysmal 3-day forecasts are greatly simplified and run for 100 years!).   Third, the rise in atmospheric CO2 is much smaller (by about 50%) than that expected from the anthropogenic activity (burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas), which implies that the missing amount of CO2 is (most probably) absorbed by the ocean. The oceanic response to increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere might be much slower than that of the atmosphere (and is presently very poorly understood). It is quite possible that after an 'adjustment time' the ocean (which contains far more CO2 than the atmosphere) will simply increase its biological activity and absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere (i.e. the atmospheric CO2 concentration will decrease)."""

The pressures that the non-drug users may well feel are no different than any other pressures that come with committing oneself to playing the game at a relatively high level of competition. If some athletes spend much more time in the weight room than others and thereby build their muscular strength to levels significantly higher than their opponents, those opponents who want to remain competitive may feel compelled to also put in more time with weights.

Far from being against the spirit of sport, biological manipulation embodies the human spirit -- the capacity to improve ourselves on the basis of reasons and judgment.  Second, if enhancement is permitted, sport will remain a test of natural physical talent... Sport would be less of a genetic lottery. The winner will be the person with a combination of the genetic potential, training, psychology, and judgment.

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The U.S. Government adopted a strong position against legalized prostitution in a December 2002 National Security Presidential Directive based on evidence that prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and fuels trafficking in persons, a form of modern-day slavery. Prostitution and related activities—including pimping and patronizing or maintaining brothels—fuel the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate.   Where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery...  Few activities are as brutal and damaging to people as prostitution. Field research in nine countries concluded that 60-75 percent of women in prostitution were raped, 70-95 percent were physically assaulted, and 68 percent met the criteria for post traumatic stress disorder in the same range as treatment-seeking combat veterans and victims of state-organized torture. Beyond this shocking abuse, the public health implications of prostitution are devastating and include a myriad of serious and fatal diseases, including HIV/AIDS...  State attempts to regulate prostitution by introducing medical check-ups or licenses don’t address the core problem: the routine abuse and violence that form the prostitution experience and brutally victimize those caught in its netherworld.

The nuclear industry, DBL found, benefited from an average of $3.5 billion a year in subsidies from 1947 to 1999. And coal, which has been getting federal and state subsidies since the early 1800s, currently receives at least $3.2 billion a year, according to a 2011 Harvard study.  Renewables, on the other hand, averaged only $370 million a year in subsidies between 1994 and 2009, according to DBL. The 2009 stimulus package did provide $21 billion for renewables, but that support barely began to balance the scales that still tilt toward fossil fuels.

The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads, ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment; more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia, LLB, in the June 26, 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller US Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated, ""The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."" [3] The McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. [51] Lawrence Hunter, Chairman of Revolution PAC, stated, ""The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech, a free press, freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights.""

01	Is Marinol Better Medicine Than Marijuana?	the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, marijuana was established as a Schedule I controlled substance. In other words, it is a dangerous drug that has no recognized medical value. Whether marijuana can provide relief for people with certain medical conditions, including cancer, is a subject of intense national debate. It is true that THC, the primary active chemical in marijuana, can be useful for treating some medical problems. Synthetic THC is the main ingredient in Marinol, an FDA-approved medication used to control nausea in cancer chemotherapy patients and to stimulate appetite in people with AIDS. Marinol, a legal and safe version of medical marijuana, has been available by prescription since 1985. However, marijuana as a smoked product has never proven to be medically beneficial and, in fact, is much more likely to harm one’s health.”

I started working on the streets in 1972 when I was a student and then I went into brothel work and massage parlours in the 80s... The client of course was totally supported by the law - it wasn't against the law to ask or pay for sex but it was against the law to ask for money for sex which of course was the activity the sex workers couldn't avoid...  Since the change in the law, people feel they can approach the police and report violence. And it has changed the dynamics between sex workers and clients."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Global warming and cooling are primarily caused by fluctuations in the sun’s heat (solar forcing), not by human activity. Over the past 10,000 years, solar minima (reduced sun spot activity) have been ""accompanied by sharp climate changes.""

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	Animals are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways. Chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with humans, and mice are 98% genetically similar to humans. [9] All mammals, including humans, are descended from common ancestors, and all have the same set of organs (heart, kidneys, lungs, etc.) that function in essentially the same way with the help of a bloodstream and central nervous system. [17] Because animals and humans are so biologically similar, they are susceptible to many of the same conditions and illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. [18] Read More
01	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""For corn ethanol produced in plants fuelled with natural gas, GHG emission reductions vary from 28% to 39%, so natural-gas-fuelled corn ethanol offers distinct GHG emission reduction benefits. Furthermore, if DGS or biomass (such as wood chips) is used as a process fuel, corn ethanol could achieve 39–52% reductions in GHG emissions. However, cellulosic ethanol is—by far—the best option to reduce GHG emissions. When resource supply (corn versus cellulosic biomass) is taken into account, cellulosic ethanol is certainly the ultimate ethanol option, offering GHG reductions of 86%."""
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Many rights have different ages of initiation. A person can obtain a hunting license at age 12, driver’s license at age 16, vote and serve in the military at 18, serve in the U.S. House of Representatives at age 25 and in the U.S. Senate at age 30, and run for President at age 35. The minimum age for initiation is based on the specific behaviors involved and must take into account the dangers and benefits of that behavior at a given age. The age 21 policy for alcohol takes into account the fact that underage drinking is related to numerous serious health problems, including injuries and death resulting from car crashes, suicide, homicide, assault, drowning, and recreational injuries. In fact, the leading cause of death among teens is car crashes, and alcohol is involved in approximately a third of these deaths.”

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“It is not surprising that most schoolyard shooters and many adult mass murderers played violent video games in their spare time. To be sure, violent people are often attracted to violent entertainment, on TV, in film, or through game consoles. However, the ability to document a direct causal link indicating that consuming violent entertainment leads to violent behavior has eluded social science researchers for years… To the extent that youngsters spend endless hours being entertained by violence says more about the lack of parental supervision and control. It isn’t that the entertainment media are so powerful; it is that our other institutions – family, school, religion, and neighborhood – have grown weaker with respect to socializing children… Banning violent entertainment may be an easy fix, especially when policymakers are unwilling or unable to deal with the more fundamental causes of violence.”
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would help reduce the federal deficit. According to Aaron Pacitti, PhD, Associate Professor of Economics at Siena College, raising the minimum wage would help reduce the federal budget deficit ""by lowering spending on public assistance programs and increasing tax revenue. Since firms are allowed to pay poverty-level wages to 3.6 million people -- 5 percent of the workforce -- these workers must rely on Federal income support programs. This means that taxpayers have been subsidizing businesses, whose profits have risen to record levels over the past 30 years."" [42] According to James K.

Within this context, the Blue Green Alliance and its partners urge the passage of comprehensive cap-and-trade climate change legislation in 2009...  Climate change impacts and higher energy costs that may accompany a policy that puts a price on greenhouse gases will affect different sectors of our population and regions of our country unequally. Climate change legislation must provide a variety of mechanisms that offset rising energy costs to low- and moderate income Americans and adversely impacted regions of the country. Such mechanisms might include energy efficiency programs, energy rebates and dividends, and tax credits and fiscal incentives for investment in the new energy economy...

Leaving aside the safety argument that perhaps the OTC pill invites less safety since doctors no longer are winnowing out people who might drop dead if they take it, here is the impact: Yes, your life is easier because you will be able to get the pill right this second, without calling my office. No, you don’t need to fill out forms and show insurance cards and wrangle over copay. But guess who is paying for the whole shabang? You. Yes, you… So in the name of consumer independence, Big Pharma and Big Drug Store and Big Insurance have found a way to finally make Uncle Sam smile. Make you pay. You want $200 worth of the pill? Go for it—just pay up first.

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Tenure in K-12 education today means that teachers (and, in many cases, principals) are granted a ‘job for life’ after a relatively short time in the classroom – usually without any serious attempt to evaluate the teacher’s effectiveness. In most states, tenure is essentially automatic after two or three years, barring criminal or extreme misconduct. Once granted, the rules and regulations accompanying tenure or permanent contracts make removing even the most unmotivated and ineffective teachers nearly impossible. These policies do nothing to advance the interests of students, but instead serve only to protect adult jobs. If tenure merely protected teachers from being fired for arbitrary or capricious reasons, StudentsFirst would support it. Professionals should never be concerned they might lose their jobs because of their age, sex, religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. Similarly, we support professionals’ rights to fight back if they are wrongfully terminated. Fortunately, well-established federal and state policies allow teachers to challenge wrongful actions and prevent discriminatory firing in public education. Tenure is simply not needed to protect such rights. To serve the interest of students, tenure must be eliminated so that teachers feel best protected by the quality of their work and the role they play on the teaching team.”

I want you to feel what it feels like when it happens over and over and over and over and over and over and over again: because that is what prostitution is...   And so, many of us are saying that prostitution is intrinsically abusive. Let me be clear. I am talking to you about prostitution per se, without more violence, without extra violence, without a woman being hit, without a woman being pushed. Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. And if you are not simple-minded, you will never understand it.

I choose to rarely go to gay bars. And so on and so forth. But I didn’t choose to be gay. In fact, I tried my damnedest to not be gay. There is really no way for me to explain how badly it sucked to grow up queer in small-town Wisconsin in the ’80s. If I could have chosen to be straight, I would have. And I did try. I spent my study hall periods in ninth grade writing letters to God asking him to make me straight. I spent my nights lying awake, trying with every ounce of my being to convince Jesus to materialize at the foot of my twin bed and take my sick queer desires into his sacred pink heart, where they’d be vanquished and I could finally date a cheerleader and be just like every other guy in my school. When, after I’d been trying for months, it didn’t happen, I spent the rest of my freshmen year considering the different ways I could kill myself… Though I agree that it should not matter how we are oriented, whether from birth or from choice, and that our access to equal rights and our freedom from punishment should not be contingent on us being ‘born this way,’ I do believe we are innately oriented.”

01	Is Therapy Aimed at Changing Sexual Orientation Unethical?	Is it ethical to engage in a therapy (such as reparative or conversion therapy) to change sexual orientation? Answer: No. Although successful and ethical treatments for legitimate psychiatric diagnoses may sometimes lead to some changes in sexual behavior, any treatment that is based on an assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder, or is based on an assumption that the patient should change his or her sexual orientation, is by its nature unethical, as it violates numerous ethics principles. Such so-called ‘treatment’ ignores established scientific evidence, demeans the dignity of the patient, succumbs to individual and social prejudice and stigma, and has often been significantly harmful to patients, families, others, and their relationships.”

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Despite the legal scaffolding to protect adolescent drivers from the dangers of driving and drinking, 16- to 20-year-old youths still accounted for 12% of the 80 million trips driven in 1999 by drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of [greater than] 0.10%… One of the most successful interventions has been the adoption of age 21 as the legal drinking age. One national study of laws raising the drinking age to 21 indicated that persons who grew up in states with a drinking age of 21, relative to those who grew up in states with lower legal drinking ages, drank less not only when they were [less than] 21 years of age but also when they were 21 to 25 years of age. A review of 49 studies of changes in the legal drinking age revealed that, in the 1970s and 1980s, when many states lowered the drinking age, alcohol-related traffic crashes increased 10%. In contrast, when states increased the legal drinking age to 21, alcohol-related crashes among people [less than] 21 years of age decreased an average of 16%. The National Highway Traffic Administration estimates that a legal drinking age of 21 has prevented [greater than] 21,000 traffic deaths since 1976. Furthermore, zero-tolerance laws, which make it illegal for drivers [less than] 21 years of age to drive after any drinking, have been associated with [approximately] 20% decreases in alcohol-related fatal crashes and DWIs.”

But whether or not we approve of sex work or would want our daughters to be thus employed, the moral argument for condemnation starts to fall apart when we consider the conditions of abuse suffered by real women working in the industry. Criminalization has been as unsuccessful in dismantling the sex industry as it has been in eliminating the drug trade and preventing back-alley abortions.  Sex work is here to stay, and by recognizing it as paid labor governments can guarantee fair treatment as well as safe and healthy work environments--including overtime and vacation pay, control over condom use, and the right to collective bargaining."""
01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“I am religious — a progressive Christian — and I will argue for the tax-exempt status of religious organizations for only one reason. Moderate and progressive religion is overwhelmingly formed in the U.S., and it is an essential voice in national and international discourse. We are an important moral and ethical voice for society as a whole, a voice that has to be religious to respond to other kinds of religious movements. The bottom line is that if historic churches like the one I serve had to pay property taxes, many of us would close. The liberal, diverse, urban churches in historic buildings would be priced out, and the newer, suburban minimall churches would be the church of the future. They are not always, but tend to be, overwhelmingly conservative. In the political arena, the right defends its agenda by that same conservative Christian language. The Christian center and left are a minority whose faith demands they work toward a more just or compassionate society, and many of us are also the stewards of prime real estate. Our tax-exempt status gives minority views a space to seed and grow, often ahead of the political culture.”

We believe that God Himself, in Scripture, has told us what our attitude should be towards the unborn. Several times it is specifically stated that He conferred divine blessing upon unborn infants. He also provided penalties for actions which result in the death of the unborn. Therefore, we deplore in the strongest possible terms the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court which has made it legal to terminate a pregnancy for no better reason than personal convenience or sociological considerations.

"""The future of Israel ultimately depends on achieving a two-state resolution to the conflict with the Palestinian people. The Palestinians too must have a national home of their own, living side-by-side with Israel in peace and security. It serves Israel's and America's interests, and it is right and just.  Israel must choose among three things: being a Jewish homeland, remaining democratic and maintaining control over all the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. It can only have two — it can only be both Jewish and democratic by giving up the land on which a Palestinian state can be built in exchange for peace.  For too long, pro-Israel advocacy has defined this conflict in zero-sum terms, as 'us versus them,' a conflict in which there can be only one winner. But being pro-Israel doesn't require an 'anti.' Israel's long-term security actually depends on fulfilling the aspirations of the Palestinian people through a two-state solution."""

Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground… During the gold standard, the price level went up, went down. Now you are right, that over very long rises, over a 40 year period, there was no change in price level. That’s the good news. The bad news is, that horizons are not 40 years. As Keynes said, in the long run, we’re all dead… During the gold standard era… [w]e had financial crises about every 10 to 20 years… [T]he period of the classical gold standard… was not a period of high growth.”
10	Zoos - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Zoo confinement is psychologically damaging to animals. Animal behaviorists often see zoo animals suffering from problems not seen in the wild, such as clinical depression in clouded leopards and gibbons, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in brown bears, and anxiety in giraffes. [31] The animals experience these issues due to smaller enclosures, changes in diet and activities, and the introduction of things not seen in the wild, such as medical exams and people with cameras. The Toledo Zoo ran a psychiatric program in which a gorilla with premenstrual depression was prescribed Prozac. To ease them into new habitats, an agitated tiger was given Valium, and anxious zebras and wildebeests were given Haldol. [32][33] A study of captive chimpanzees found that ""abnormal behaviour is endemic in the population,” and includes behaviors such as eating feces, twitching, rocking back and forth, plucking hair, pacing, vomiting, and self-mutilation, among others. The study concluded that the cause of such behavior could be mental health issues. [34] About 24% of captive orcas have ""major"" to ""extreme"" tooth wear and 60% had tooth fractures as a result of stress-induced teeth grinding. [35][36] As a result of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which exposed the psychological damage done to orcas by SeaWorld, California outlawed captive orca breeding. [36]"
10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“[T]he important question today is whether continued unilateral drone attacks will substantially reduce Al Qaeda’s capabilities. They will not… Qaeda officials who are killed by drones will be replaced. The group’s structure will survive and it will still be able to inspire, finance and train individuals and teams to kill Americans. Drone strikes hinder Qaeda fighters while they move and hide, but they can endure the attacks and continue to function. Moreover, as the drone campaign wears on, hatred of America is increasing in Pakistan. American officials may praise the precision of the drone attacks. But in Pakistan, news media accounts of heavy civilian casualties are widely believed. Our reliance on high-tech strikes that pose no risk to our soldiers is bitterly resented in a country that cannot duplicate such feats of warfare without cost to its own troops. Our dogged persistence with the drone campaign is eroding our influence and damaging our ability to work with Pakistan to achieve other important security objectives like eliminating Taliban sanctuaries, encouraging Indian-Pakistani dialogue, and making Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal more secure… If we are ever to reduce Al Qaeda from a threat to a nuisance, it will be by working with Pakistan, not by continuing unilateral drone attacks.”
01	Is the ACLU Good for America?	would like to say a word in defense of the American Civil Liberties Union… I shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians… The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU, try answering with something like this: ‘Sure, they’re on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they’re right.'”

"""There is no difference between elevating your blood count by altitude training, by using a hypoxic air machine, or by taking EPO [erythropoietin]. But the last is illegal. Some competitors have high PCVs [packed cell volumes] and an advantage by luck. Some can afford hypoxic air machines. Is this fair? Nature is not fair. Ian Thorpe has enormous feet which give him an advantage that no other swimmer can get, no matter how much they exercise. Some gymnasts are more flexible, and some basketball players are seven feet tall. By allowing everyone to take performance enhancing drugs, we level the playing field. We remove the effects of genetic inequality. Far from being unfair, allowing performance enhancement promotes equality."""

10	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""Recent studies claiming that executions reduce crime... fall apart under close scrutiny. These new studies are fraught with numerous technical and conceptual errors: inappropriate methods of statistical analysis, failures to consider all the relevant factors that drive crime rates, missing data on key variables in key states, the tyranny of a few outlier states and years, weak to non-existent tests of concurrent effects of incarceration, statistical confounding of murder rates with death sentences, failure to consider the general performance of the criminal justice system... and the absence of any direct test of deterrence.  These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims... Social scientists have failed to replicate several of these studies, and in some cases have produced contradictory results with the same data, suggesting that the original findings are unstable, unreliable and perhaps inaccurate. This evidence, together with some simple examples and contrasts... suggest that there is little evidence that the death penalty deters crime."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Climate change is real and has happened throughout history on local, regional, continent-wide, and global scales, driven by a variety of atmospheric, cosmic, geologic, and meteorological factors… [A]t the worst, humans are having a modest effect on Earth’s climate, with the increase in carbon dioxide possibly having a net beneficial effect (due to the enhanced plant productivity resulting from higher carbon-dioxide levels)… Anthropogenic warming theorists’ climate models assume temperatures should climb alongside rising carbon-dioxide levels, yet temperatures fell from the 1940s through the 1970s, even while emissions were rising dramatically. For the past two decades, carbon-dioxide levels have continued to increase, but global satellites have recorded no significant temperature increase for 18 years… Almost all the harmful impacts predicted by climate models are failing to materialize. For instance, climate models predicted more intense hurricanes, but for nearly a decade, the United States has experienced far fewer hurricanes making landfall than the historic average, and those hurricanes that have made landfall have been no more powerful than previously experienced.”
10	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""In 2005, of all deaths in the Netherlands, 1.7% were the result of euthanasia and 0.1% were the result of physician-assisted suicide. These percentages were significantly lower than those in 2001, when 2.6% of all deaths resulted from euthanasia and 0.2% from assisted suicide..  Conclusions: The Dutch Euthanasia Act was followed by a modest decrease in the rates of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The decrease may have resulted from the increased application of other end-of-life care interventions, such as palliative sedation."""
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“In 1962, the United States enacted a trade embargo on Cuba due to the Castro regime’s anti-American and anti-democratic actions. The Cuban dictatorship demonstrated overt hostile actions toward democracy and human rights. Fifty years later, while the world around them has changed, and their allies are now Chavista and Mullah instead of Soviet, we see a continuing need for full enforcement of the embargo and other sanctions until free elections, civil liberties and democracy are returned to the Cuban people.”

Fact - No one has received a special exemption from the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the health care reform law explicitly includes language regarding the health insurance plans for Members of Congress and their staff.  As a United States Senator, Senator Leahy's health plan options are the same options offered to all federal employees. Included in the Affordable Care Act, was a provision that requires that 'the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and Congressional staff shall be health plans that are created under this Act or offered through an Exchange established under this Act.' Members of Congress and their staffs can only purchase health insurance coverage from the health insurance exchanges that are made available for uninsured Americans. The full text of this provision is available on pages 80-81 in section 1312 of the Affordable Care Act."""

They are excellent sources of phytochemicals and antioxidants, while containing little fat, no cholesterol, and no animal proteins."""
10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“The United States should avoid anything that remotely resembles a gold standard. Fixing the exchange rate against gold diverts the focus of monetary policy away from ensuring domestic economic stability to maintaining an arbitrary exchange-rate target. That is the wrong approach when the economy is still suffering from the aftermath of the recent financial crisis. The Federal Reserve should be free to take whatever actions it feels necessary to promote economic growth and ensure stable prices without having to worry about the exchange rate. If the dollar depreciates against other currencies and other countries do not like it, so be it… The United States should remain committed to a flexible, market-determined exchange rate regime to ensure its monetary independence and prevent the outbreak of damaging and counter-productive protectionism.”
10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	"Public safety should be left to professionally qualified police officers, not private citizens with little or no expert training. Some states, such as Georgia and Maryland, do not require any training before receiving a concealed carry permit. In Alaska, Arizona, Wyoming, and Vermont, a permit is not necessary to carry a concealed gun. [75] In states that do require training, it can be inadequate. For example, while Wisconsin requires that concealed weapons permit holders have training, there is no minimum training time requirement. [76] Mark Schauf, Police Chief of Baraboo, WI, said, ""as police officers, we're required to have training before we get our weapons and a certain number of training hours throughout the year.

For nine out of ten states considered, and for the United States overall, we find virtually no difference in age - , actuarial value - , and tobacco use – standardized small group premiums in scenarios with and without the Affordable Care Act. Of course, individual firms may experience an increase or decrease in premiums, depending on the health status of their enrollees. However, overall, we find no evidence to suggest that small premiums will systematically change as a result of the law."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“Vaccines work by protecting individuals, but their strength really lies in the ability to protect one’s neighbors. When there are not enough people within a community who are immunized, we are all at risk. Personal and religious belief exemptions should be curtailed because some people, whether because of age or compromised immune systems, cannot receive vaccines. They depend on those around them to be protected. Vaccines aren’t the only situation in which we are asked to care about our neighbors. Following traffic laws, drug tests at work, paying taxes — these may go against our beliefs and make us bristle, but we ascribe to them because without this shared responsibility, civil society doesn’t work. Public health is no different.”
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Both students and teachers are unfairly, unnecessarily, and for no legally cognizable reason (let alone a compelling one), disadvantaged by the current Permanent Employment Statute [tenure]… These statutes leave school districts with no choice but to employ a number of grossly ineffective tenured teachers who harm their students year after year, contributing to the provision of widely disparate educational opportunities to similarly situated California students, in violation of the state constitution. It could take anywhere from two to almost ten years and cost $50,000 to $450,000 or more to bring these cases to conclusion under the dismissal statutes… grossly ineffective teachers are being left in the classroom because school officials do not wish to go through the time and expense to investigate and prosecute these cases.”

10	Do Studies Conducted on Homosexuality in Twins Show a Genetic Basis of Sexual Orientation?	and Pillard found that the incidence of homosexuality in the adopted brothers of homosexuals (11%) was much higher than recent estimates for the rate of homosexuality in the population (1 to 5%). In fact, it was equal to the rate for non-twin biological brothers. This study clearly challenges a simple genetic hypothesis and strongly suggests that environment contributes significantly to sexual orientation… Indeed, perhaps the major finding of these heritability studies is that despite having all of their genes in common and having prenatal and postnatal environments as close to identical as possible, approximately half of the identical twins were nonetheless discordant for orientation. This finding underscores just how little is known about the origins of sexual orientation.”
10	Is Obamacare a Socialist Law? - DEBATED	"""No, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 is not 'socialized medicine' or a 'government takeover' of U.S. health care. Quite the contrary: the new legislation enhances the central role of private, for-profit corporations in our health system.  In fact, by forcing thousands of businesses and millions of individuals to buy health insurance from private corporations, and by subsidizing the purchase of this (often shoddy and inadequate) coverage, the new law is throwing an economic lifeline to a decidedly market-based model of financing care – one that puts profit maximization above the nation's health.  The new legislation was decisively shaped by the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. These firms lavished hundreds of millions of dollars on Congress in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions over the past several years to make sure their profit-making enterprises were protected under any reform."""

Marijuana use is also associated with serious mental and physical health consequences to which adolescents and young adults are particularly susceptible… [T]here is compelling evidence that marijuana is neurotoxic to children and adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes ‘medical marijuana’ for children. Several recent news reports have portrayed the short term benefits of marijuana for children with complications of chemotherapy, seizures, and autism. While the anecdotal reports can be dramatic, we do not know how these children fare in the long run.

Electrical and transportation energy are derived from chemical energy by thermal power plants, heat engines, or fuel cells...  Renewable electricity will gradually replace fossil fuels. Electricity will become the base of our energy system. It does not make sense to continue with chemical energy technologies by converting good electricity into hydrogen...  Hydrogen can never compete with its own energy source, with electricity...  Therefore, the answer to the question: 'Does a Hydrogen Economy make Sense?' is an unconditional 'NEVER'.

10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	A right to health care could lower doctors’ earnings. The Medicare system in the United States is a single-payer system where government pays for health care bills, and between 1998 and 2009 it reduced physician payments in three different years. [91] In 2017, the Congressional Budget Office reported that private insurance payments were, on average, 200% higher than payments made by Medicare for certain treatments such as radiation therapy or MRI scans and 89% higher for hospital admissions. [150] In Canada and the United Kingdom, where there is a universal right to health care, physicians have incomes 15-51% lower than US doctors. In the United States, the average physician income is $299,000 compared to $256,062 in Canada, and $147,778 in the United Kingdom. [151] [152] [153] Read More
10	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""At first blush, the ability of local police to enforce federal immigration law seems like a viable solution to our nation's challenge of illegal immigration. However, piling the additional duty of immigration enforcement upon our already strained local police will do little more than force illegal immigrants and those who associate with them further into society's shadows. The negative effects which will result thereafter are significant.   First, enforcement of immigration laws by local police will discourage and even prevent undocumented immigrants from accessing police services and will prevent police from the benefit of immigrants' cooperation in fighting and investigating crime… Furthermore, adding immigration enforcement to the gambit of local police duties will strain the resources of local police. The main mission of local police is to prevent and solve local crime. Requiring local police to pick up the slack of federal immigration agencies will only divert crime fighting resources without solving the problem of illegal immigration.   Perhaps most importantly, local police run the risk of violating the civil rights of both legal and illegal immigrants when enforcing immigration laws."""

Second, not all doping techniques are created equal. The most effective regimens are also the most sophisticated and expensive...So if doping is legalized, the sport's richest riders and teams will have access to techniques that lesser lights don't. The playing field, never level, would be tilted permanently.  Medical laws and medical ethics prevent us from letting athletes use these substances outside of a clinical trial. But athletes, who eagerly seek out anything that will give them a competitive edge, will still try and get them...Simply put, wherever you draw the line, something, some technique or substance, will always be off-limits. And so you've merely moved the line, not erased it...  Finally, none of that addresses the moral problems involved in legalizing doping. Doping in sports isn't inherently wrong; it's wrong by the value system with which we judge sports. Sports themselves are by their nature civilized: everyone agrees to follow a certain set of rules. If you don't, that's cheating. Legalizing doping doesn't change those rules as much as remove them altogether, and then it's no longer a sport, but merely entertainment. Right or wrong, we look to sports and to athletes for an inspiration that mere entertainment cannot provide - there is an implicit contract that the sweat and effort we see before us is real and natural.

[92] It has damaged 80% of streams and riparian areas in the western United States. [93] 85% of US land used for grazing livestock is not suitable for farming. [27] Abstaining from meat would help in the restoration of vast US lands more naturally suited to provide habitat for native plants and animals. Read More
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“In warzones, drones are another tool to eliminate this [terrorist group] leadership. Like bullets from rifled weapons that are more accurate for sniper killings than mini-balls from muskets; like tanks that pack more firepower than infantry; like advances in aircraft that proved so devastating against German cities during World War II. Drones, too, are another advance in the way we can strike an adversary with lethal force, a more surgical, high-tech way to kill an enemy in a warzone, but another weapon in the machine of war nonetheless. Questions about the ethics of drones, in warzones, would seem misdirected. We have a common understanding, rules of war, for battlefields. If you hear an adversary’s voice on a radio and fire a piece of artillery against that position, you have acted within the rules of warfare. If you strike with a drone, the delivery tool is different, but the target and result are the same. It often appears that our focus on drones stems more from fascination with new technology than with any real distinction between what a drone is designed to do—eliminate the enemy—and what a conventional airstrike would accomplish.”
01	Is Legal Prostitution a Part of Sexual Liberation?	"""Feminism has always advocated for women to enjoy freedom of choice. Women have made great strides in the courtrooms, the boardrooms, and the bedrooms. But there remains a long way to go. Negative attitudes toward sexuality, in particular, have made it hard for women to be fully liberated. But thanks to feminists, prostitute activists, and their supporters, things are slowly changing. Only when women have their sexual and personal choices protected and respected can they truly be free."""
10	Are Existing Testing Efforts Effective in Detecting the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs?	"""One of the main ways officials enforce the code is by drug testing. The problem for athletes is that no testing regime is infallible. All tests, can and do produce false positives. And with a substance like testosterone which can both occur naturally and as an anabolic steroid, it's even further complicated. Because when testing for testosterone, officials first look at an athlete's T/E ratio, that is the ratio of testosterone in his or her body. If that ratio is higher than 4 over 1, they suspect that an athlete has engaged in doping. The difficulty is that some athletes naturally have elevated testosterone levels."""
01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“Many less-well-off households- particularly minority households and those with low education and earnings – currently save very little and therefore own almost no financial wealth at retirement. As a result, the distribution of bequeathable wealth among retirees in the United States is highly unequal. There is strong evidence that Social Security, which forces the poor to annuitize a large fraction of what would otherwise be their retirement savings, may be contributing to this inequality. In contrast, a system of individual accounts would allow workers to accumulate real and bequeathable wealth and would lead ultimately to greater equality of wealth. Social Security privatization therefore becomes the truly progressive option for reform – one that is most likely to benefit the poor.”
10	"Do the Words ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Improperly Endorse Religion?"	"""For more than two hundred years, many of our expressions of national identity and patriotism have referenced God. The Supreme Court, which opens each session by saying 'God save the United States and this honorable Court,' has affirmed time and again that such official acknowledgments of our Nation's religious heritage, foundation, and character are constitutional. The Department of Justice will continue vigorously to defend the ability of American schoolchildren to pledge allegiance to the flag."""
10	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?	"""We agree that in certain situations it is reasonable and desirable to limit the level of care in these severely disabled and suffering infants: but the direct taking of human life crosses a major boundary line. Almost all civilised societies distinguish between an active act of taking another life and merely standing by and watching someone die. This distinction is recognised by most religions but is particularly felt by physicians and nurses, who have to perform the act, and who for centuries resisted the deliberate taking of human life...   Alternatives to euthanasia in the care of these infants certainly exist. Paediatric palliative care emphasises an interdisciplinary team approach to the physical, social, and psychological needs of the patient and their families, with expert management of pain and associated symptoms. This holistic philosophy of pain control, symptom management, and psychosocial support should be the standard of care for children with life threatening illnesses and resources should be provided for its implementation.   The sole criterion for ending the life of these infants is their poor quality of life. Who gave physicians the right to determine quality of life and to practise euthanasia on that basis? Infants need to be protected by society irrespective of their medical condition and not condemned to die. In many countries physicians have already abandoned the longstanding honourable medical tradition of not deliberately terminating human life, by accepting a policy of active euthanasia in terminally ill competent adults; there is no justification for extending that policy to suffering children."""
01	Do Senior Citizens Feel Comfortable Using Electronic Voting Machines?	"""We were led to believe the elderly voters were going to have the most problems with voting on the machines so we scheduled 2 morning demonstrations in our Calendar House and had 100 plus senior citizens vote on the machines.   Because we were anxious to determine what problems voters would face, we let the seniors vote without assistance just outlining the general operation of the machine. To a person [sic] they had no trouble using the machines and loved them.   Comments like 'great', 'it's about time', 'love them', 'easy to use' were the order of the day.

01	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""The AAFP supported this legislation [Obamacare] for many reasons, not the least of which is its goal of achieving health coverage for nearly everyone in this country...  No one in this country should delay or forego needed care because of cost. Instead, we believe that the nation must:  Provide health care in the broadest sense rather than focusing only on sick care... Address the factors that drive up costs and lower quality... Build up the primary care physician workforce to meet the requirements of everyone who needs care.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act already has made important strides toward achieving these bold and life-saving goals. It will expand insurance coverage by about 30 million people. Although this still falls short of coverage for everyone, the number of uninsured people will be reduced by more than half. It will encourage better health delivery models, emphasize the high value of primary care, support research and demonstrations of what works and what is needed, and it will help evaluate methods for controlling health care costs and improving health care quality."""
01	Does Obamacare Require Payment Cuts to Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare Part C)? - YES	"""Medicare pays private insurers more per enrollee than the program pays for seniors under its traditional structure — a gap that the Affordable Care Act aims to eventually close. The president's health-care law is expected to reduce Medicare Advantage funding by about $156 billion over a decade, according to a 2012 Congressional Budget Office projection. The health insurance industry has sharply criticized program cuts, contending that seniors will see reduced benefits and fewer health care choices as a result.  Medicare Advantage cuts required by the ACA started in 2012, and despite some dire predictions, enrollment in the program increased every year since the ACA was signed in 2010. The ACA's final cuts to the program are supposed to continue each year until 2017. The average monthly premium in 2014 plans were expected to increase $1.64 to $32.60, the Department of Health and Human Services announced last September."""

The Reform of the US Health Care System, when it is fully implemented, will require everyone to purchase a Medical Insurance Policy. This feature is the so-called Individual Mandate that will insure the medical needs of everyone.   However there is no individual Mandate for DENTAL CARE, only a provision for children's dental care after 2014."""
01	Is It Misleading to Label Milk as Free of the Artificial Growth Hormone rBST/rBGH?	"""A number of milk processors have begun to label their products as 'hormone free,' 'rbST free,' or 'rBGH free,' to indicate they come from cows that have not been treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST). We understand that consumers are charged a significant premium for these milk products. The clear implication of these claims, reinforced by the price premium, is that such products are safer or healthier than 'regular' milk.  This practice is in conflict with FDA's determination that milk from cows treated with rbST is no different, in terms of health and safety, from milk from untreated cows. These label claims also appear to be false or misleading under the FDA's interpretation of the law...  FDA in 2003 issued Warning Letters to several milk processors objecting to this practice. Given its recent reappearance and increasing popularity, we suggest that FDA again consider taking action to protect consumers of an essential food."""
10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Rising energy costs have played a role in the current U.S. economic slowdown and security of supply remains an important concern for households, business, and government. Some suggest that enlarging the current U.S. effort to replace conventional fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) with renewables could provide new jobs and help restore strong economic growth...  [N]egative economic consequences… would occur from replacing lower cost energy with higher cost energy [from renewables]...  [P]olicymakers need to promote U.S. energy supplies of all types and avoid unrealistic climate change policies. Allowing increased access to both offshore and on-shore areas for drilling and exploration would also have a positive impact."""
10	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""Before 1954, the Pledge affirmed that we were 'one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.' Indivisible means we can rise above our differences, religious or otherwise. Liberty means the right to act and speak freely no matter what one's faith or philosophy may be. And Justice, of course, means equal rights for all, regardless of whether or not we believe in a deity. The Knights of Columbus - a Catholic men's group - led the lobbying effort to add 'under God.' Now the Pledge is twisted, with divisive religious language that implies true patriots must be believers.   With 'under God' added, the Pledge is not a statement of patriotism. Instead, extremist preachers and politicians point to the language to validate their view that those who don't believe in God don't belong...   Until the Pledge is restored to its inclusive version, we can take it upon ourselves to refuse to participate in what's become a discriminatory exercise."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"The free market should determine minimum wages, not the federal government. A survey by the Small Business Network found that 82% of small businesses agreed that ""the government should not be setting wage rates."" [74] According to Per Bylund, PhD, Research Professor at Baylor University, the federal minimum wage ""disrupts the balance of the market and prohibits the creation of new jobs."" Bylund stated that the free market should determine wages based on the value of work produced so employers can hire the needed number of workers at wage levels that make sense for their businesses. [75] According to Mark J. Perry, PhD, of the American Enterprise Institute, government-mandated minimum wages ""are always arbitrary and almost never based on any sound economic/cost-benefit analysis... [I]n contrast market-determined wages reflect supply and demand conditions that are specific to local market conditions and vary widely by geographic region and by industry."" Perry said market-determined wages result in more employment opportunities for unskilled workers, increased profits for companies, and lower prices for the consumer. [76] Read More"

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Making the Pill OTC would increase the use of hormonal drugs that may disrupt and damage the body. The FDA notes the side effects of the Pill include changes in sexual desire, bleeding between periods, sore breasts, headaches, and nausea. [74] Some medical practitioners believe that pharmaceutical contraceptives in general are harmful because women are not as aware of their bodies or their natural cycles when taking synthetic hormones. [78]Holly Grigg-Spall, health author, stated, “Health problems caused by hormonal contraceptives can appear a few months, a few years or longer into use as each woman processes the synthetic chemicals differently. Yet all women will be changed by these drugs. As a woman’s body changes so does her reaction to the pill. The pill’s repression of vital bodily functions that leads to ill health can build in such a way that years later a woman becomes very sick but can not make the connection.” [78] Lara Briden, ND, a naturopathic doctor, emphasized these concerns are bigger for teens: “Making hormones is not easy. It requires regular ovulation, and that can take a few years to become established. That’s why the early years of menstruation are exactly the wrong time to take hormonal birth control.” [79] Read More

01	Is Poor Representation by Public Defense Attorneys a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""[A] shocking two out of three death penalty convictions have been overturned on appeal. They were overturned because of police and prosecutorial misconduct, as well as serious errors by incompetent court-appointed defense attorneys with little experience in trying capital cases.  How can we contend that we provide equal justice under the law when we do not provide adequate representation to the poor in cases where a life hangs in the balance?...  We, the Congress, must bear our share of responsibility for this deplorable situation. In 1996, we defunded the death penalty resource centers, the State offices which ensure adequate representation to the poor in capital cases...  In short, while others, like Governor Ryan in Illinois, have recognized the flaws in the death penalty, the Congress still just doesn't get it. This system is broken…  It is far too frequent an occurrence that an indigent defendant in a capital case is furnished a lawyer who has never tried a death penalty case.  It is common for these inexperienced attorneys to give up after a client is found guilty and present no evidence at the sentencing phase. This is literally the phase of a trial where a man's life hangs in the balance."""

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""I entertained and had sex with all kinds of men, from the rich and famous, to Hasidic Jewish businessmen, from Mafia gangsters, to police officers. Naturally I had quite a few clients who worked as judges and lawyers.

They came to me racked with stress and tension, and left feeling relaxed and blissful. I could take pride in my work. I'm convinced that without prostitution, the legal system could not function...   I continued to do prostitution for twenty years. I've always been involved in the grass roots movement to decriminalize prostitution--the political cause which is most near and dear to my heart. We've made some baby steps. It's really about time that someone, somehow, challenge the prostitution laws and get them thrown in the garbage where they belong.

01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""We recognize that a comprehensive peace agreement is unattainable right now. We should strive, instead, to establish facts on the ground by beginning to create a two-state reality in the absence of an accord. Imperfect as it is, this plan would reduce tensions and build hope among both Israelis and Palestinians, so that they in turn would press their leaders to obtain a two-state solution. Most important, as Israel celebrates 64 years of independence later this week, it would let us take our destiny into our own hands and act in our long-term national interest, without blaming the Palestinians for what they do or don't do."""
01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	"Armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations, including mass shootings, more deadly. None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 was stopped by an armed civilian. [41] Gun rights activists regularly state that a 2002 mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in Virginia was stopped by armed students, but those students were current and former law enforcement officers and the killer was out of bullets when subdued. [41] Other mass shootings often held up as examples of armed citizens being able to stop mass shootings involved law enforcement or military personnel and/or the shooter had stopped shooting before being subdued, such as a 1997 high school shooting in Pearl, MS; a 1998 middle school dance shooting in Edinboro, PA; a 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, CO; and a 2008 bar shooting in Winnemucca, NV. [42] Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, ""The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.""

The Bill of Rights mentions religion twice, once in prohibiting an establishment of religion (a clear reference to any branch of Protestant Christianity, which was then the dominant religion) and a second time, in guaranteeing the free exercise of all religions.

The HHS final regulation on standards related to essential health benefits implements the deductible provisions described in section 1302(c)(2) for non-grandfathered health insurance coverage and qualified health plans offered in the small group market, including a provision implementing section 1302(c)(2)(C) so that such small group market health insurance coverage may exceed the annual deductible limit if it cannot reasonably reach a given level of coverage (metal tier) without exceeding the deductible limit...  The Departments recognize that plans may utilize multiple service providers to help administer benefits (such as one third-party administrator for major medical coverage, a separate pharmacy benefit manager, and a separate managed behavioral health organization). Separate plan service providers may impose different levels of out-of-pocket limitations and may utilize different methods for crediting participants' expenses against any out-of-pocket maximums...  The Departments have determined that, only for the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2014, where a group health plan or group health insurance issuer utilizes more than one service provider to administer benefits that are subject to the annual limitation on out-of-pocket maximums under section 2707(a) or 2707(b), the Departments will consider the annual limitation on out-of-pocket maximums to be satisfied if both of the following conditions are satisfied:  The plan complies with the requirements with respect to its major medical coverage (excluding, for example, prescription drug coverage and pediatric dental coverage); and  To the extent the plan or any health insurance coverage includes an out-of-pocket maximum on coverage that does not consist solely of major medical coverage (for example, if a separate out-of-pocket maximum applies with respect to prescription drug coverage), such out-of-pocket maximum does not exceed the dollar amounts set forth in section 1302(c)(1)."""

10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“[N]ot all socio-economic households and schools can afford a tablet, mobile apps, and access to WiFi for their school-aged children. For this reason, I am afraid that many families and classrooms will be left behind as tablet technology becomes mainstream. Only higher income households and schools scoring high on standardized tests will be able to afford these new technologies. My other concerns are privacy issues and proper supervision of students as they gain access to the Internet. Teacher and parental supervision are paramount for all age groups to insure that they are not being exposed to improper online content. Teachers and parents must make sure that tablets are being used responsibly by their children and students, and that these devices are being used for educational activities, not just for playing games and online entertainment. We won’t know the affect tablets and computers will have on the quality of education. Goals must be established and educators must make sure that tablets and other mobile teaching devices are producing higher test scores and grades.”
10	"Is it Valid to Look to the Intent of the Founding Fathers in Determining Whether the Words ""under God"" Should Remain in the Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""Had the Founding Fathers possessed the foresight to predict the multitude of interpretations we have tried to read back into their minds, they might have given us carefully crafted dissertations covering everything from the nascent public school movement to public Christmas displays... We must cure ourselves of the desire to invoke the Founding Fathers as the last word on interpretation. That august group gave us merely the first few words, and remarkably few of them at that...  Not only have we already discovered that there is no clear and convincing evidence as to what the Founding Fathers intended when they enacted the establishment clause, but we have also seen that there may well be no original intent at all. The record of congressional debates, ratification debates, commentary, and the like discloses a combination of disinterest and confusion about the meaning of the establishment clause on the part of virtually all the people we could conceivably call Founding Fathers. Their various 'intents' can hardly be synthesized into a coherent, consistent mandate. Thus, while a doctrine of original intent might have some appeal in cases in which we can be absolutely certain as to the nature of the original intentions (assuming such a case exists), without that certainty such a doctrine becomes virtually useless as an authoritative interpretive framework."""
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“In 2018, tenure is no longer necessary. Over the past century, tenure has transformed into an obsolete, protectionist racket that does more harm than good. First and foremost, teacher tenure creates complacency because it guarantees job safety. Unlike almost every other profession, teachers are commonly awarded tenure very early in their careers, which virtually removes accountability and the incentive for excellent job performance. As a result, public schools are inundated with ineffective tenured teachers who put in minimal effort and fail to adequately educate students… As if incompetent teachers in far too many classrooms don’t pose enough of a threat to quality education, the time it takes to actually dismiss an inept teacher is appalling. Furthermore, the sheer cost of the process is a severe and totally unnecessary strain on state and local education budgets… Additionally, tenure places seniority in front of all other factors (including performance) when staffing reductions must be made. This antiquated policy of ‘last-hired, first-fired’ indiscriminately protects veteran teachers and punishes young teachers. Even worse, this backward procedure cripples cutting-edge teaching methods and innovations – which are far more likely to be introduced and honed by young teachers… Tenure is an archaic and sclerotic system that blunts education innovation, teacher accountability and student learning.”

10	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""Known as a slippery slope argument or what one commentator has called the 'thin edge of the wedge' argument, the opponents of assisted-suicide conjure up a parade of horribles and insist that the only way to halt the downward spiral is to stop it before it starts...   This same nihilistic argument can be offered against any constitutionally-protected right or interest. Both before and after women were found to have a right to have an abortion, critics contended that legalizing that medical procedure would lead to its widespread use as a substitute for other forms of birth control or as a means of racial genocide. Inflammatory contentions regarding ways in which the recognition of the right would lead to the ruination of the country did not, however, deter the Supreme Court from first recognizing and then two decades later reaffirming a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in terminating an unwanted pregnancy. In fact, the Court has never refused to recognize a substantive due process liberty right or interest merely because there were difficulties in determining when and how to limit its exercise or because others might someday attempt to use it improperly.   Recognition of any right creates the possibility of abuse. The slippery slope fears of Roe's [Roe v. Wade] opponents have, of course, not materialized. The legalization of abortion has not undermined our commitment to life generally; nor, as some predicted, has it led to widespread infanticide. Similarly, there is no reason to believe that legalizing assisted suicide will lead to the horrific consequences its opponents suggest."""

The US ranks 26th out of 32 for voter turnout among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. [8] In the 2016 presidential election, 55.7% of the American voting-age population cast a ballot. By comparison, Belgium reported the highest OECD voter turnout: 87.2% in the most recent national election. Sweden came second with 82.6%. [8] Among registered voters in the 2016 US presidential election, being ""too busy” or having a conflicting schedule was the third-highest reason cited for not voting, accounting for 14% of registered voters who did not cast a vote (about 2.7 million people). [9] Former Editor-in-Chief of the Northwestern University Law Review, Beau C. Tremitiere, JD, stated, ""The demands of school and work schedules keep millions of Americans, especially those with children or long commutes, from ever getting to their polling stations… The ideal solution is simple: Congress should make Election Day a national holiday, or move Election Day to the weekend."" [10] A holiday would allow more citizens volunteer at polling places or drive the elderly to vote, and make a difference in states where long lines at the polls keep voters waiting for hours.

10	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""As pediatricians and professors dedicated to the prevention of childhood obesity, we were disappointed by the March 2015 American Academy of Pediatrics' Policy Statement on 'Snacks, Sweetened Beverages, Added Sugars, and Schools.'   The [American Academy of Pediatrics'] Committees' endorsement of adding sugar to the milk of millions of schoolchildren conflicts with the majority of leading health organizations' recommendations, such as the American Heart Association, which recommends that children consume only 3 to 4 teaspoons of added sugar per day. If a child drinks a single 8-oz carton of flavored milk at school, he or she will consume the recommended daily amount of added sugar in 1 sitting...   The evidence shows that sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of excessive sugar intake for children and that excessive energy and sugar consumption can lead to obesity and dental caries. In light of these findings, we encourage these committees to critically review their statement and reconsider how flavored milk offerings in schools may affect children's health and well-being."""

10	Does Drinking Milk Inhibit Iron Absorption and Contribute to Anemia?	"""Iron and calcium are two nutrients important for young children's growth and development. Despite suggestions that too much calcium may decrease iron storage in red blood cells, a new study shows higher calcium intakes do not impact iron absorption. Researchers placed preschool children ages 3-5 on two diets: a low-calcium diet (about 500 mg) and a high-calcium diet (about 1,000 mg). The results showed no difference in iron absorption. Additionally, children who increased their calcium intakes also increased their calcium absorption, which may benefit bone growth and development. Milk, cheese and yogurt foods were the primary sources of calcium for children in the study. The authors conclude that kids can benefit from more calcium without negatively affecting their iron absorption or increasing the risk of iron deficiency anemia."""

[T]he clemency consideration should be a meaningful review. If the governor remains as the final-decision maker in death penalty clemency applications, she should meet personally with the attorneys and publicly report an explanation for the clemency decision. This would have the advantage of restoring accountability for the pending execution and would educate the public about the administration of justice in the state.  Clearly, many miscarriages of justice are not corrected through the executive clemency process.

10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Since 1973, legal abortions in America have taken the lives of 55 million people. If 55 million Americans died tomorrow, whoever led the genocide would not get a parade in celebration, bumper stickers in support, or be a viable candidate for political office. Fifty-five million lives equals 17.5% of the country’s current population. It’s a number greater than the population of any state in the Union, and greater than the population of 219 of the world’s country’s [sic] including South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Australia, Argentina, and Canada. Fifty-five million is about the same as the population of the 25 smallest states and Washington D.C. combined… Both science and Scripture are absolutely clear that life begins at conception. Taking a human life is murder, by definition, which makes abortion a murderous act… …Believe it or not, federal legislation forbids the murder of an unborn baby—except in the 55 million instances when it doesn’t. And a father can be convicted of murdering his unborn child without the mother’s consent, but if a woman decides to end her pregnancy against the wishes of the father, that’s her right to choose. Choose murder? Can’t follow all of the logic? Perhaps that’s because it’s illogical… Abortion is not a matter of politics. It’s a matter of life and death, for 55 million and counting. Enough.”
10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“The basis for testing animals prior to human consumption of new medications or releasing new chemicals is that animals offer predictive value for outcomes or conditions in humans. The same is true for using animals in research aimed to find the cause of human disease. In science, predictive value has a very specific meaning and can be calculated. For decades, scientists have known that the positive and negative predictive value for animal models is not useful—the values are so low that scientists know no more about the value or danger of a drug or chemical than they did before testing on animals. Despite this proven lack of value, the process has continued for many reasons. The predictive value of using animals to find causes of, and thereby potential targets for, curing human diseases is even lower. Ethical, human-based research and testing is available and should be more widely implemented.”

10	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""Immigration enforcement by local police would likely negatively effect and undermine the level of trust and cooperation between local police and immigrant communities. If the undocumented immigrant’s primary concern is that they will be deported or subjected to an immigration status investigation, then they will not come forward and provide needed assistance and cooperation. Distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police would develop among legal immigrants as well. Undoubtedly legal immigrants would avoid contact with the police for fear that they themselves or undocumented family members or friends may become subject to immigration enforcement.  Enforcement of federal immigration laws would be a burden that most major police agencies would not be able to bear under current resource levels... The specific immigration status of any particular person can vary greatly and whether they are in fact in violation of the complex federal immigration regulations would be very difficult if not almost impossible for the average patrol officer to determine. At this time local police agencies are ill equipped in terms of training, experience and resources to delve into the complicated area of immigration enforcement.  For example, the Katy, Texas Police Department participated in an immigration raid with federal agents in 1994. A total of 80 individuals who were detained by the police were later determined to be either citizens or legal immigrants with permission to be in the country. The Katy police department faced suits from these individuals and eventually settled their claims out of court."""

One option is that the family of the victim would demand compensation... a sum of money in compensation...The second possibility is that the family of the murderer demand exaction, i.e., then the offender would be killed. And third is to forgive... And it’s quite interesting here, the Koran goes on to say, in the same verse in which it endorses the three part structure, it says, and those who forgive are higher in the sight of God.  Because God has decreed this area to be God’s own, the area of life and what happens when a life is taken away, if you, in fact, punish with the ultimate punishment, the death penalty, you must prove the case per the ways that God has decreed that you prove these cases. Otherwise, you cannot implement the death penalty.

01	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""The nuclear power plant design strategy for preventing accidents and mitigating their potential effects is 'defense in depth'--- if something fails, there is a back-up system to limit the harm done, if that system should also fail there is another back-up system for it, etc., etc. Of course it is possible that each system in this series of back-ups might fail one after the other, but the probability for that is exceedingly small. The Media often publicize a failure of some particular system in some plant, implying that it was a close call on disaster; they completely miss the point of defense in depth which easily takes care of such failures. Even in the Three Mile Island accident where at least two equipment failures were severely compounded by human errors, two lines of defense were still not breached--- essentially all of the radioactivity remained sealed in the thick steel reactor vessel, and that vessel was sealed inside the heavily reinforced concrete and steel lined 'containment' building which was never even challenged...  Risks from reactor accidents are estimated by the rapidly developing science of 'probabilistic risk analysis' (PRA). A PRA must be done separately for each power plant (at a cost of $5 million) but we give typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation. In 2 out of 3 melt-downs there would be no deaths, in 1 out of 5 there would be over 1,000 deaths, and in 1 out of 100,000 there would be 50,000 deaths. The average for all meltdowns would be 400 deaths. Since air pollution from coal burning is estimated to be causing 10,000 deaths per year, there would have to be 25 melt-downs each year for nuclear power to be as dangerous as coal burning."""

Solar energy could produce 100 percent of electricity demanded in the U.S. on .3 percent of the nation's land, while wind power could create 2.6 times the amount of electricity used in the U.S. with turbines in just twelve states.  A change in fuels would also have benefits in the area of transportation. According to the Department of Agriculture, biofuels could make up 37 percent of transportation fuels in the U.S. by 2025. If combined with the use of fuel-efficient vehicles, this percentage could rise to 75 percent. Further advances in technology, such as the use of hydrogen fuel cells, and an increase in the use of hybrid vehicles would create further benefits."""

01	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	Lowering corporate income taxes results in increased international investment in the United States and thus more jobs. According to a working paper published by the OECD, countries with higher corporate tax rates lose revenue in foreign direct investment (FDI) as compared to countries with lower corporate tax rates. [50] A peer-reviewed study published in Applied Economics looked at corporate tax rates and FDI in 85 countries. The study found that a 10% reduction in the corporate income tax rate was associated with an increase in foreign direct investment equivalent to 2.2% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That investment money could be used by US businesses to invest and expand their workforces. [8] Read More

10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	is not an adequate base of research that shows marijuana, in its most common form (smoked), is effective for treating any serious medical condition. Therefore, no major group of medical experts supports the use of smoked marijuana for treatment of health problems… We do not have enough information to reliably estimate the safety of marijuana when used long term. Most studies to date have followed patients for very short periods of time, often less than a week. This is not adequate to assess risk of use for indefinite periods of time. We do know that marijuana can contribute to short- and possibly long-term brain impairment, motor vehicle accidents, risk of addiction and an increased risk of long-term psychosis in vulnerable people.”
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Prohibiting young people from consuming alcohol doesn’t stop them from drinking. But it does make drinking much less safe. Instead of drinking at a bar, for example, students drink secretly in dorm rooms or at clandestine parties, where they are much less likely to be supervised and where drinks spiked with drugs are much more likely. If someone overindulges or becomes ill, their friends are less likely to seek medical and other assistance. Why? Because underage drinking is illegal, and calls for help risk self-incrimination. Moreover, banning the sale of alcohol to people under 21 is certain to encourage binge drinking… Since most college students are unable to buy their own alcohol, they have friends, family members, or even strangers buy it for them. But these people are not always available. This lack of a reliable supply makes young drinkers are more likely to overindulge when alcohol is available. Lowering the drinking age would help mitigate or reverse these effects. With a reliable supply, young drinkers would have less incentive to binge. And when binging did occur, they would be more likely to seek help. Besides being ineffective, the drinking laws are incredibly costly. In 2005 the consequences of the underage drinking (missed work, healthcare costs, etc.) spurred by current policy cost taxpayers $60.3 billion. The U.S. government also spends millions of dollars every year enforcing these ineffective policies.”

The second training devoted more time to role plays, but the presentation of what to do was fast and cursory, and most people had not read the manuals beforehand, resulting in lots of confusion. Little effort was made to explain the purpose of particular documents or requirements; the rush to get through 'what to do' left no time for 'why.'

Other biomass resources show, at best, very low net energy recovery...  The two most popularly suggested energy alternatives, wind and solar, suffer because they're undependable, intermittent sources of energy, and the end product is electricity. We have no way to store large amounts of electricity for use when wind and sunshine are not with us. Geothermal and tidal energy are insignificant energy sources in total but can be locally important. Nuclear energy can be a large power source if the safety aspects can be guaranteed (and this may be possible) -- but again, the end product is electricity. There is no battery pack even remotely in sight that would supply the energy needed to effectively power bulldozers, heavy agricultural equipment such as tractors and combines, or 18-wheelers hauling freight cross-country.  Can electricity be used to obtain hydrogen as a fuel from water? It can, but hydrogen is difficult to store and dangerous to handle. And there is no energy system now visualized to replace kerosene jet fuel, which propels a Boeing 747 about 600 miles an hour nonstop on the 14-hour trip from New York to Capetown (currently the longest plane flight).

This assumption is belied by the production decline in fields throughout the world, such as Exxon's Prudhoe Bay, which continues to decline despite advanced recovery techniques...  There is evidence to suggest that the peak is imminent, if it has not already arrived. Non-OPEC supplies are clearly nearing a peak, with five years of negligible one-to-two percent growth.

01	Should Bottled Water Be Banned? - Top 4 Pros and Cons	Banning bottled water would reduce waste and protect the environment. About 70% of plastic water bottles bought in the United States are not recycled, [1] which means the majority end up in landfills or in the oceans, harming the ecosystem and poisoning animals. Plastic water bottles were the third most commonly collected trash during the Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup behind cigarette butts and plastic food wrappers. [3] It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic waste by weight in the oceans than fish. [4] Almost all plastic water bottles are made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the raw materials for which are derived from crude oil and natural gas. [5] The Pacific Institute found that it took about 17 million barrels of oil to produce enough plastic for the bottles of water consumed by Americans in 2006. [6] Since 2006, American consumption of bottled water has increased 65% from 8.3 billion gallons in 2006 to 13.7 billion gallons in 2017, increasing the need for more plastic water bottles and thus more oil and gas. [7][8] A nationwide ban on bottled water would lead to an estimated 68 billion fewer plastic water bottles being manufactured, purchased, used, and discarded. [2] Between 2012 and 2016, a ban on plastic water bottles in 23 US National Parks prevented (per year) up to 2 million plastic water bottles being purchased and up to 111,743 pounds of PET being produced.

01	Do the Health Insurance Exchanges Benefit Consumers? - DEBATED	"""Consumers will greatly benefit once an exchange is in place. Here's why:  Competition: An exchange will make the state's insurance market more competitive. The exchange will force insurers to compete for customers based on value, instead of luring them with the trickiest fine print. The exchange will have an easy-to-use website that allows consumers to make apples-to-apples comparisons when they shop for health plans. On this level playing field, quality insurers of all sizes—not just the largest and most powerful—will be able to compete.  Transparency: Insurers in the exchange will have to use easy-to-understand language to describe their products—a vast improvement over the confusing jargon that consumers face now. And insurers will be required to share information about plan costs and quality in a standardized way so that consumers can truly understand what they're getting.  Affordability: In the exchange, middle-class consumers (those who earn up to nearly $90,000 for a family of four in 2011) will be eligible for tax credits to help them pay their insurance premiums.  Many people will also receive help with copayments, deductibles, or other cost-sharing. And the exchange will monitor insurers to make sure that they aren't unreasonably increasing their premium rates from year to year."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?

The evidence concerning the positive effects of decriminalization suggests that we can do a great deal better."""

10	Is Homework Beneficial? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Homework disadvantages low-income students. 41% of US kids live in low-income families, which are less likely to have access to the resources needed to complete homework, such as pens and paper, a computer, internet access, a quiet work space, and a parent at home to help. [34][35] They are also more likely to have to work after school and on weekends, or look after younger siblings, leaving less time for homework. [35][25][36] A study by the Hispanic Heritage Foundation found that 96.5% of students across the country said they needed to use the internet for class assignments outside of school, and nearly half reported there had been times they were unable to complete their homework due to lack of access to the internet or a computer, sometimes resulting in lower grades. [37][38] Private tutoring is a more than $6 billion enterprise that further advantages students from wealthier families. [25][39] A study published in the International Journal of Education and Social Science concluded that homework increases social inequality because it ""potentially serves as a mechanism to further advantage those students who already experience some privilege in the school system while further disadvantaging those who may already be in a marginalized position.""

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"The competitive nature of a video game is what arouses aggression, not the level of violent content. A peer-reviewed study in Psychology of Violence determined that the competitive nature of a video game was related to aggressive behavior, regardless of whether the game contained violent content or not. The researchers concluded: ""Because past studies have failed to equate the violent and nonviolent video games on competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action simultaneously, researchers may have attributed too much of the variability in aggression to the violent content."" [125] A follow-up study tracked high school students for four years and came to the same conclusion: the competitive nature of the games led to the increased hostile behavior. [126] Read More"
10	Are Humans Substantially Responsible for Global Climate Change Today?	"""There is no quantitative evidence that varying levels of minor greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4 have accounted for even as much as half of the reconstructed glacial-interglacial temperature changes or, more importantly, for the large variations in global ice volume on both land and sea over the past 650kyr [650,000 years]. This paper shows that changes in solar insolation [amount of solar energy hitting the earth] at climatically sensitive latitudes and zones exceed the global radiative forcings [greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere trapping solar heat] of CO2 and CH4 by severalfold...  [T]he popular notion of CO2 and CH4 radiative forcing as the predominant amplifier of glacial-interglacial phase transitions cannot be confirmed...  Our basic hypothesis is that long-term climate change is driven by insolation changes, from both orbital variations and intrinsic solar magnetic luminosity variations. This implies natural warming and cooling variations."""
01	Is Prostitution a Victimless Crime?	"""It's not difficult for a free society to keep violent crime to a minimum — with little intrusion on individual liberty and at relatively low cost. But governments also prosecute 'victimless' crimes. These are acts that (1) are illegal, (2) involve no intrusion on anyone's person or property, and (3) about which no injured party files a complaint with the police. These acts include such things as prostitution, gambling, and drug use. They are activities in which all parties participate voluntarily...   Either individuals are responsible for their own acts — including their choices of relationships — or the government is responsible for everything you do. There is no middle ground. Giving government the power to outlaw consensual activity allows the politicians to impose any laws they want on you. And they will use that power."""
10	Would Legal Prostitution Better Protect Prostitutes from Violence?	"""Legalisation does NOT reduce violence.   Women who bring charges against pimps and clients will bear the burden of proving that they were 'forced.'

Violence is the nature of sex industry.   It is a cruel lie to suggest that decriminalisation or legalisation of the whole industry will protect prostitutes. It is not possible to protect someone whose source of income exposes them to the likelihood of being raped on average once a week."""

"""It is well known that rBGH increases levels of another growth hormone, IGF-1, which is identical in cows and humans. At elevated levels, IGF-1 is known to increase cancer rates in humans. Dale Bauman's point that the body produces more IGF-1 than is taken in by dietary factors is accurate, as far as it goes. But he completely ignores the fact that even small additional amounts of hormones can have significant effects on human health. Moreover, there is much that is still unknown about IGF-1, especially long-term effects of drinking large quantities of milk at a young age...  Most of the industrialized nations of the world, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and all 25 nations of the European Union, have disallowed the use of rBGH, based primarily on human and animal health concerns. The Codex Alimentarius, the U.N.'s main food safety body, has concluded there is NO consensus that rBGH is safe for human consumption."""
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“[Historical precedent] is precisely is why we maintain a trade and tourism embargo on the Cuban dictatorship. Because, first, it is in the national interest of the United States for there to be a democratic transition in Cuba, as it obviously is in the interest of the long-suffering people of Cuba. Second… it is critical that external pressure be kept for a democratic transition to take place in Cuba once the dictator is no longer on the scene. The gravely ill Fidel Castro might have given up some titles, but he remains the tyrant. At the time of his death, it will be critical for the U.S. embargo to be in place as it is today, with its lifting being conditioned on three fundamental developments: the liberation of all political prisoners; the legalization of all political parties, labor unions and the press; and the scheduling of free elections.”

And, numerous Colorado marijuana regulators have been indicted for corruption… According to the Colorado Department of Public Safety, arrests in Colorado of black and Latino youth for marijuana possession have increased 58% and 29% respectively after legalization. This means that Black and Latino youth are being arrested more for marijuana possession after it became legal… The true impact of marijuana on our communities is just starting to be learned. The negative consequences of legalizing recreational marijuana will be felt for generations… We’ve seen the effects in our neighborhoods in Colorado, and this is nothing we wish upon the nation.”

A case in point is the Sequoia AVC Edge Mk1, a computerized voting machine that will be used in 13 states this year, including in swing states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The so-called direct-recording electronic vote-counting system has long been known to be susceptible to relatively simple hacks that manipulate tallies and ballots...  [T]he hacks might be used to alter a relatively small number of results in swing states, where outcomes have been known to be decided by fewer than a few hundred or a few thousand votes.

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Economic inequality continues to increase in the United States. The richest 1 percent control almost 40 percent of our country’s wealth, while people earning the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour are living near or below the poverty line in almost every state. Women, who make up two-thirds of the minimum wage workforce, are most severely impacted. Increasing wages seems like a no-brainer. Minimum wage raises across the board would put women and men on equal economic footing, as well as spur economic growth. Higher wages put more money in the pockets of more people and boost consumer spending, increasing overall economic activity. Boosting the minimum wage also would help shrink the gender pay gap and the imbalances of power in the workplace that come with it. On average, women earn only about 80 cents per every dollar that a man earns. And the gap is even wider for Black and Latina women.”
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“I am pro-choice because, as a lifelong Republican, I believe that individual rights should be paramount—and that this extends to the rights of individuals to make personal decisions about reproduction. As a mother, of course I am pro-life, and I believe that the government’s role in creating and enforcing reproductive health legislation is to protect individuals’ ability to access all options. While this is the truly Republican thing to do, it is also the right thing to do. The government must not be involved in personal healthcare decisions. Those who oppose contraception and abortion are free to make that choice for themselves and their families, but not for others… Those under the supposedly “pro-life” umbrella falsely believe that outlawing abortion prior to fetal viability will reduce the rate and occurrence of abortions. Decades of data show that this is simply not the case. The actual impact is an increase in later term abortions that risk the life and health of the mother—a decidedly anti-life result. In addition, these efforts are explicitly unconstitutional and a waste of both time and tax dollars in defense of a losing cause, diverting attention from the real work our Congress needs to do to run our country. We know—both from the recent testimony of hundreds of Texan women and from the statistics provided by the CDC and other health organizations—that these kinds of unnecessary intrusions into the private relationships between individuals and their physicians are dangerously out of line with any efforts to promote or protect life. They are similarly out of line with a genuinely conservative philosophy of limited government.”

The right of an American citizen to exercise arguably the most critical expression of citizenship should not be denied. Nor should the decision on whether an American citizen regains the rights to vote be left in the hands of a select few politicians whose decisions are often arbitrary and motivated by partisan politics and corporate interests...

However, the information provided is often misleading and of variable quality, with many advertisements citing inappropriate publications to support their promotional claims. The misuse of scientific evidence erodes trust in true, evidence-based advice and contributes to public confusion… DTCA increases the likelihood of the consumer requesting the advertised product and/or believing they have a condition, resulting in increased prescribing.

01	Is a College Education Worth It?	College education has a high return as an investment. Return on investment (ROI) is calculated by dividing the gain from an investment (here the money earned as a result of a college degree) by the cost of the investment (the money spent on a college degree). A college degree has a return of 15% per year as an investment, larger than the stock market (6.8%) and housing (0.4%). [32] Completing some college, but not earning a degree, resulted in a 9.1% return on investment. [8] If a student spent $17,860 (the average cost of tuition and room and board in 2012-2013 for four years at a public university [33]), that student could expect a 15% return of $2,679 each year.

01	Has DNA Testing Led to Significant Improvements in the Criminal Justice System?	"""In little more than a decade, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) evidence has become the foremost forensic technique for identifying perpetrators, and eliminating suspects, when biological tissues such as saliva, skin, blood, hair, or semen are left at a crime scene. First introduced into evidence in a United States court in 1986 and the subject of numerous court challenges in the ensuing years, DNA evidence is now admitted in all United States jurisdictions...  Moreover, law enforcement agencies and legislatures have come to understand the potential of using DNA testing systematically by constructing DNA databases on a State and Federal level that inventory DNA profiles from new unsolved cases, old unsolved cases, and convicted offenders. As these DNA databanks grow in size, society will benefit even more from the technology's incredible power to link seemingly unrelated crimes and to identify with alacrity suspects who were until then completely unknown to investigators...  A remarkable feature of DNA testing is that it not only helps to convict but also serves to exonerate. A 1995 survey of laboratories reported that DNA testing excluded suspects in about one-fourth to one-fifth of the cases...These suspects were fortunate: Before the advent of DNA testing they might have been indicted on the basis of an eyewitness' statement or other evidence and possibly been convicted on the basis of such proof."""

10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century. It is the accumulation of vast amounts of untaxed church property. In 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled; in 1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time, as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority and through blood. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation, exempting only the last resting place of the dead and possibly, with proper restrictions, church edifices.”

01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""[T]he prospects for a two-state solution are receding. Secretary of State Kerry's sterling efforts have produced regrettably few results, perhaps because he addressed only part of the problem. But the international community cannot give up. Credible polls show that the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians still want a two-state solution. The only alternatives are the status quo or a binational state of some kind. Both are a dead end. The status quo means drift, more settlements, Gaza imprisoned and isolated with more extremism, and Israel retreating to another Masada fortress… There is no secure future in the status quo for Israelis or Palestinians.  As to the binational state or one-state solution, Kerry's withdrawn public reference to apartheid was in fact right. The population trends show that there are at present 6 million Israeli Jews, with a similar and rapidly growing population of Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. If this is to be a Jewish nation, it would, in all likelihood, lead to an apartheid nation of Bantustans, where democracy would be undermined by the treatment of Palestinians as second-class citizens. Israel would be at serious risk of no longer providing a permanent home for the Jews, but of destroying itself through civil strife and international condemnation…  [G]iven leadership and determination, Israelis and Palestinians can still reach a two-state solution and that the dangers for all parties in the alternatives still outweigh the challenges of reaching a peace settlement."""

And until the Florida medical marijuana initiative passed with an astonishing 71.3 percent majority in 2016, I realized I had many misconceptions about the drug. With research, though, I learned that marijuana not only has multiple potential medical uses, but it also has fewer side effects compared to other medications… In addition to pain relief, medical marijuana provides relief to the common conditions associated with chronic pain, such as anxiety/depression and insomnia. With medical marijuana, the pharmacological management for chronic pain can be simplified with lesser need to also prescribe medications for anxiety, depression and insomnia… The addictive effect of marijuana is slight, and there is no risk of death with marijuana withdrawal.”

Not all sports have to be object (like football and baseball), or combat (like boxing and karate). [25] Read More
01	Does Illegal Immigration Disadvantage American Workers?	"""[A]nyone who tells you that immigration doesn't have any negative effects doesn't understand how it really works. When the supply of workers goes up, the price that firms have to pay to hire workers goes down. Wage trends over the past half-century suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at least 3 percent. Even after the economy has fully adjusted, those skill groups that received the most immigrants will still offer lower pay relative to those that received fewer immigrants.   Both low- and high-skilled natives are affected by the influx of immigrants. But because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip. The monetary loss is sizable...   We don't need to rely on complex statistical calculations to see the harm being done to some workers. Simply look at how employers have reacted. A decade ago, Crider Inc., a chicken processing plant in Georgia, was raided by immigration agents, and 75 percent of its workforce vanished over a single weekend. Shortly after, Crider placed an ad in the local newspaper announcing job openings at higher wages."""

Sex workers provide a service which is needed and wanted by many...  I cannot accept that in this day and age our nation should continue to make criminals of sex workers because the Bible says it is wrong. In the first place, Christianity is not the state religion of New Zealand, and even within Christianity there are different interpretations of the Bible and related teachings. Secondly, the only prostitutes directly condemned in the Bible were those who used sex as a method of worship, which is not something commonly practised in this country.  The Bible takes a much stronger stand against adultery than against common whoredom, but I doubt that even the more conservative among us would wish to see adulterers cooling their heels in Auckland Central police station...  And I don't lack a conscience because I believe we would all be better off in a society which had the honesty to accept the job choice that some adults make as valid and worthy of care and compassion, for all our sakes."""

10	Does Illegal Immigration Pose a Terrorist Threat to the United States?	"""Some restrictionists have made arguments that relate the problems of terrorism (such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001) with illegal immigration in the United States. There are some legitimate concerns about terrorism and immigration (as well as tourist visas) on the whole. But illegal immigration along the southern US border is not a contributor to terrorism…   Empirically, the case is simply false. Foreigners who’ve carried out terrorist attacks have entered the United States legally on immigrant, non-immigrant work/study, or tourist visas. While some of them may have been ‘illegal’ in the sense of overstaying their visas, this is a qualitatively different problem than border crossing.    Getting a tourist visa remains considerably easier than getting an immigrant or work/study visa…    In recent history, most terrorism in the United States has been motivated by certain Islamist ideologies. Most illegal immigrants who cross the border to the United States come from Mexico and Latin America, where Catholicism is the main religion. Radical Islam has, if anything, less of a stronghold in these countries than in the United States."""

It all comes down to a very simple reality: It puts other children at risk. If you want to rely on the public trust then you have an obligation to the public trust as well, and part of that obligation is not sending your child to a place with other children if they aren’t immunized against preventable, communicable diseases. I imagine the anti-vaccination movement will be up in arms about this, but here’s the thing: They’re wrong. They’ve been trying to tie vaccines to autism for years, andthey’re wrong. They’ve been saying vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them, but they’re wrong. They say vaccines overtax a baby’s immune system, but they’re wrong.

It’s unlikely the increase was entirely due to improved detection because, according to one review, we would expect to see a plateau, then a reduction in incidence, which has not occurred. The most serious type of brain cancer has increased in parts of the brain near where people hold their phones. Observations that overall increases in brain cancer were not seen after the introduction of cellphones merely serve to illustrate that there can be a considerable lag between exposure to a carcinogen and the cancer’s diagnosis.”

[26] Former US State Department Legal Adviser and current Yale Professor of International Law Harold Koh says that a state engaged in an ""armed conflict or in legitimate self-defense"" is not required to provide targets with legal processing before using lethal force, and a country may target individuals in foreign countries if they are directly participating in hostilities or posing an imminent threat that only lethal force can prevent. [27] The United States also has the right under international law to ""anticipatory self-defense,"" which gives the right to use force against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defense is ""instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation.""

01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	"Private accounts benefit the poor and minorities. In the current system, groups of people with shorter life expectancies (such as the poor and African Americans, for example) effectively have their income transferred to people with longer life expectancies because the latter can collect their benefits for longer.

10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""A lot of people don't have confidence that their votes will be counted as have been cast. We will be using some touch-screen voting machines in California in June, but fewer than we might have. The lawsuit that was filed persuaded some counties from purchasing more electronic voting machines. But really, we're going to have to go back and deal with all of the security risks and the problems that have occurred in other states before we before we get ready to deploy the equipment in November... It has just been astonishing how many problems there have been with the electronic voting equipment."""
01	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""Controlling for a variety of state characteristics, we investigate the impact of the execution, commutation, and removal rates, homicide arrest rate, sentencing rate, imprisonment rate, and prison death rate on the rate of homicide. The models are estimated in a number of different forms, controlling for state fixed effects, common time trends, and state-specific time trends. We find a significant relationship among the execution, removal, and commutation rates and the rate of homicide. Each additional execution decreases homicides by about five, and each additional commutation increases homicides by the same amount, while one additional removal from death row generates one additional homicide."""
01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“I think he will be seen as a stunningly successful president… When I traveled around with him in the country, these are the promises he made: he said, ‘I’ll revive the economy.’ 22 million jobs later, this is the best economy in the history of the world, in the history of capitalism, the finest economic situation any people have ever had. He said, ‘I’ll reduce the deficit by half.’ I thought that was a little optimistic over-promising in the campaign. He’s more than reduced it. He’s now going to pay down the national debt if the Republicans don’t squander it away in a tax cut. ‘I’ll end welfare as we know it.’ Mission accomplished. He said, ‘I’ll put 100,000 cops on the street and cut crime.’ The lowest crime rate in 30 years. He said, ‘I’ll expand trade and be a new kind of Democrat, passing a free trade deal with Mexico and then later with China.’ Mission accomplished on every critical juncture, except health care, where he promised national health insurance… I tell you, it’s the most successful presidency since FDR, maybe LBJ if he hadn’t had Vietnam, but if you look at what the man set out to do and what he accomplished, stack him up against anybody.”
10	Is It Appropriate for Former Election Officials to Work for Electronic Voting Machine Manufacturers?	"""There are conflicts of interest that have called into question the independence of the DRE manufacturers. Among the conflicts:  Alfie Charles left his job as the press secretary for California Secretary of State Bill Jones to become a spokesman for Sequoia in 2002. It was Jones' office that pressed for the passage of the $200 million funding initiative for DRE machines. Kathryn Ferguson, once the election chief in Clark County, Nevada - where Las Vegas lies - has been a lobbyist for Sequoia since 2001. In 2003, Nevada purchased Sequoia voting machines for the entire state. Sandra Mortham was hired as a lobbyist by ES&S to sell DREs in Florida, where she had served as secretary of state from 1995 to 1999.  This revolving door between elected officials and the voting machine companies... makes clear that in many states, the choice to switch to DREs in this election cycle has not simply been a matter of objective decision making, but one where money and political persuasion has held sway."""

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“If teacher tenure is an important obstacle to achievement, Mississippi (with no teacher tenure) should have stellar schools and Massachusetts (with teacher tenure) should have failing ones. Instead, it’s the other way around. Correlation is not causation, of course, but across the country the states without tenure are at the bottom of performance rankings. States with the highest-achieving public schools have tenure (and teacher unions). K-12 teachers with tenure do not have a job for life. What ‘tenure’ means, for them, is due-process procedures for dismissals with cause, instead of capricious or at-will dismissal from their duties. I’ve spoken to countless teachers from Southern states who are afraid to do the things that New York City teachers do all the time – write blogs, write letters to the editor, even show up to a rally – because they could lose their jobs for speaking out. All working people should have such protections.”
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising can cause damage by instigating rapid, widespread stimulation of use of new drugs before harmful effects are fully known. Advertisements exaggerate treatment benefits and use emotive messages to target people with milder health problems, many of whom are unlikely to benefit from the drugs advertised. Advertising leads to higher drug costs and overall health care costs through substitution of new, expensive drugs without treatment advantages.”
01	Do Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails Increase the Likelihood of an Electronic Voting Machine Malfunctioning?	"""Adding a paper printing device to a DRE machine naturally adds another component that can fail, run out of ink, jam, or run out of paper. If DREs are alleged already to be prone to failure, adding a paper trail cannot improve that record. In Brazil in 2003, where a small number of precincts had installed paper trails, failures of the printers delayed voters by as much as 12 hours, a figure that would be catastrophic in the U.S...  The presence of the [paper trail] mechanism increases the load on the machine's power supply and processor and itself increases the probability of failure."""

10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Students, along with teachers and parents, intuitively recognize the value of using paper in learning… Nearly two-thirds of K-12 teachers (64%) feel students comprehend information better and are more engaged (63%) when they read on paper. Close to two-thirds (64%) of K-12 teachers reveal their students even respond better to lessons that are based on paper textbooks. When students hold books in their hands, teachers see more hands raised, and that translates into more participation and engagement… Moms and dads are more likely to help their children with homework when they are working with paper textbooks, written assignments or hands-on crafts (71%). Again, this isn’t a generational preference. Millennial-aged parents, the most proficient with digital technologies, are more likely than other parents (74% vs. 69%) to prefer to help their child with homework on paper as opposed to a computer.”
01	Are DACA and the DREAM Act Good for America?	"""We believe that the young people who would benefit from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) deserve the opportunity to take their full and rightful place in the U.S. The possible changes to the DACA that were recently reported would remove all benefits and force people out of the U.S. - that is simply unacceptable.  Removing DREAMers from classrooms, universities, internships and workforces threaten to put the very innovation that fuels our technology sector at risk. Just as we said with previous Executive Orders on Immigration, the freedom for ideas and innovation to flow across borders is something we strongly believe in as a tech company. More importantly it is something we know is necessary to fulfill our mission to protect and advance the internet as a global public resource that is open and accessible to all.   We can't allow talent to be pushed out or forced into hiding. We also shouldn’t stand by and allow families to be torn apart. More importantly, as employers, industry leaders and Americans -- we have a moral obligation to protect these children from ill-willed policies and practices. Our future depends on it."""
01	Is Legal Prostitution a Legitimate Business?	"""Sex work is legitimate work and problems within the industry are not inherent in the work itself.

Sex workers can only gain the same rights as other workers when the debate is moved from a moral framework and placed in the framework of labour rights."""
01	Should Felons Have to Pay All Fines, Fees, and Restitutions Related to Their Conviction before Regaining Their Vote?	"""If you do the crime, you should do the time -- and pay the fine. But according to a ruling last week by a King County Superior Court... Judge Michael Spearman said a state law requiring felons to pay all fines and court-ordered restitution before they can vote violates the U.S. and state constitutions...   These are felons we're talking about. They chose to break the law. Sorry, but there's a price to pay for that. And this ruling doesn't just apply to fines paid to the state -- it includes court-ordered restitution to a criminal's innocent victims. Who is looking out for their interests?   And why shouldn't states have the right to decide what constitutes full payment of a felon's debt to society, including the restoration of voting rights? In Washington and other states, prisons are already packed. Using fines and restitutions in felony sentencing is good public policy because it offers a rational alternative to long, costly prison sentences."""
01	Is Parallel Testing an Effective Method of Assuring the Accuracy of Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Parallel testing is the only procedure available to detect non-routine code bugs or malicious code on DRE systems. In addition to laboratory testing during the certification process it is essential that DRE systems get tested during real elections, using so-called parallel testing procedures. Parallel testing is needed for two separate purposes: (a) to test the myriad parts of the system that get used during a real election but not in a laboratory testing situation, and (b) to check for the possible presence of malicious code or insider manipulation that is designed specifically to avoid detection in a laboratory or testing situation, but to modify votes surreptitiously during a real election. Where possible, parallel testing should be performed in every jurisdiction, for each distinct kind of DRE system."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In my police career, I met and even developed working relationships with 'working girls.' The work is nothing like Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman.' It is deplorable and in many ways degrades and robs the participants of fragile parts of their humanity...  [M]any prostitutes have been forced or coerced into sex trafficking by abusers. Legalization won't stop that. More than likely, male abusers still will profit from trafficking their victims — this time, in legalized locations facilitated and regulated by the government itself.  Legalization would put lipstick on modern-day slavery and call it another step in the liberation of women.  I would say the idea that prostitution should be legalized is wrong. For those few who suggest otherwise, I would argue sex for money is illegal not just because it's immoral, but because it's just plain bad for women at every level."""
01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Uniforms are a very important part of the school’s identity. It brings so many benefits in terms of moral, discipline and results because it is a leveller of children of all backgrounds. The uniform is exactly that – a uniform – rather than a fashion statement. We have a styling of uniforms for girls that’s more comfortable, practical and more suited for a girl’s shape. There is a move in schools for girls’ skirts to be kept at a decent level. Some schools are moving to mid-calf-length skirts to reflect the workplace and the type of dress these girls will be required to wear in adult life. Fashion and image are very important. These are highly emotional subjects for girls. And as far as girls are concerned it is very important that they don’t have to give in to these sort of pressures so they actually welcome [wearing a uniform]. They like to look smart – which is one of the huge benefits of a uniform – and that also means that they don’t have to rise to stereotypical images and behaviours and therefore can be themselves.”

10	Is Qualification Testing Conducted by Independent and Accredited Entities?	"""The 'independent testing labs,' or ITAs, that test voting systems are not completely independent of the companies that make voting equipment. The ITAs are private, for-profit labs that receive money from voting vendors to test their systems, giving the vendors control over such parts of the testing process as who gets to view the test results. This lack of transparency means that state officials who buy voting machines seldom know about problems that occurred with machines during testing. Until now there has been no oversight of the testing labs and no clearinghouse for tracking problems with voting systems."""
01	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""Not all of the critics of birthright citizenship are xenophobes or hysterics. Nevertheless, the attack on it is ignoble, based on a canard that women are streaming into the United States to bear 'anchor babies' who will secure their own — and, with luck, their parents' — residence in this country. The reality is that conferring citizenship on any child born in the United States — regardless of the immigration status of its parents — is an important affirmation that being an American doesn't depend on bloodlines…  Birthright citizenship is an emblem of equality and inclusion. Many other countries confer citizenship on the basis of bloodlines, what the law calls jus sanguinis. That makes sense when nationality is conceived of primarily in terms of ancestry or tribe or race or ethnicity. But in America, a nation of immigrants, citizenship is defined differently. That principle was established when the 14th Amendment was adopted, and it should not be tinkered with today in an effort to keep out unwanted immigrants. Indeed, the decision to grant citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil was made in part so that members of particular minority groups would not be required to win the favor of the majority to claim the privileges of American citizenship.  Birthright citizenship provides a clear standard that sweeps away questions about whether someone has the proper ethnicity or antecedents to be an American. There are too many examples in history of people being victimized because of who their parents were. There is no good reason to add to them."""
10	Is Golf a Sport?	Golf does not require defense against the player’s opponent. Some people think that if an activity does not involve defense or an opponent trying to affect your performance, then it is not a sport. In hockey, a player can steal the puck and a goalie can block a shot. In football, a pass can be intercepted and someone can be tackled to prevent him from scoring. There is no defense in golf, and participants are unable to impact the outcome of their opponents' scores. Read More
01	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""The economic and social consequences of illegal immigration... are staggering... Illegal aliens have cost billions of taxpayer-funded dollars for medical services. Dozens of hospitals in Texas, New Mexico Arizona, and California, have been forced to close or face bankruptcy because of federally-mandated programs requiring free emergency room services to illegal aliens. Taxpayers pay half-a-billion dollars per year incarcerating illegal alien criminals. Immigration is a net drain on the economy; corporate interests reap the benefits of cheap labor, while taxpayers pay the infrastructural cost... $60 billion dollars are earned by illegal aliens in the U.S. each year. One of Mexico's largest revenue streams (after exports and oil sales) consists of money sent home by legal immigrants and illegal aliens working in the U.S... This is a massive transfer of wealth from America - essentially from America's displaced working poor - to Mexico. The total K-12 school expenditure for illegal immigrants costs the states $7.4 billion annually."""

[F]or the time being, the voters' good sense about the possible scenarios - the advent of new constituencies of prisoners whom politicians court for votes, for instance - still prevails.

10	Election Day National Holiday - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Changing state laws and individual companies’ policies would be more effective ways to help people vote. According to the AFL-CIO, 30 states require employers to allow employees time off for voting. Arizona, for example, allows employees who do not have three consecutive hours before or after work when the polls are open to take paid time off to vote at the start or end of their work days. [26] Creating laws in all states that let people vote before or after work would be more effective than a national holiday, which would quickly be viewed as just another day off to enjoy. [27] Companies including Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Farmers Insurance, Kaiser Permanente, Patagonia, and Walmart have joined Make Time to Vote campaign, which encourages employers to provide paid time off, schedule no meetings on Election Day, and give information on mail-in ballots and early voting.

01	Is Marinol Better Medicine Than Marijuana?	smoked marijuana — which contains more than 400 different chemicals, including most of the hazardous chemicals found in tobacco smoke — Marinol has been studied and approved by the medical community and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the nation’s watchdog over unsafe and harmful food and drug products. Since the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, any drug that is marketed in the United States must undergo rigorous scientific testing. The approval process mandated by this act ensures that claims of safety and therapeutic value are supported by clinical evidence and keeps unsafe, ineffective and dangerous drugs off the market. There are no FDA-approved medications that are smoked. For one thing, smoking is generally a poor way to deliver medicine. It is difficult to administer safe, regulated dosages of medicines in smoked form. Secondly, the harmful chemicals and carcinogens that are byproducts of smoking create entirely new health problems. There are four times the level of tar in a marijuana cigarette, for example, than in a tobacco cigarette.”
10	Would Allowing Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Decrease Fan Turnout, Revenue, and Corporate Sponsorship?	"""A further argument is that sponsors will be deterred if drugs are used in high level sport and that governments will act adversely and withdraw support. There is nothing to support this thesis. Fans come to see Herculean efforts and the fact that competitors may have used drugs has not deterred record attendances. The fans want to be entertained and the popularly held belief that all athletes take drugs has not deterred attendees...  It is difficult to believe that the TV firms who pay such exorbitant amounts of money to televise high level sport would be worried in private at least, that some or all athletes were using drugs...  Fans come to the events to see record breaking performances that often result from the use of drugs. The fans want to see new world records and they want to be entertained.

01	Is There a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Euthanasia involves a death that is intended (not merely foreseen) in order to benefit the person who dies. It differs from physician-assisted suicide undertaken in the interest of the person who dies partly in that it involves a final act or omission by someone other than the patient (e.g., the doctor) in order to end the patient's life.... In active euthanasia, the doctor introduces the cause of the patient's death, e.g., a lethal injection.... Active physician-assisted suicide can involve, for example, the provision of means of death, like pills, that a patient may use. However, it might also involve giving the patient a stimulant to keep him awake so that he can shoot himself. That is, the active assistance need not involve giving a lethal substance."""
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""The IMA [Islamic Medical Association] endorses the stand that there is no place for euthanasia in medical management, under whatever name or form (e.g., mercy killing, suicide, assisted suicide, the right to die, the duty to die, etc.).

I supported the death penalty when I was in the Illinois General Assembly. I spoke for the death penalty. I voted for the death penalty. And I believed in the death penalty...  But since those days, a lot has happened to shake my faith in the death penalty system...  I said that until I can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent person would be put to death, nobody would meet the fate as long as I was Governor... And I won't sign off on any death sentences until I am absolutely certain that the individual, in fact, is guilty and all rights have been preserved and safeguarded...  It was clear to me that when it came to the death penalty in Illinois there was no justice in the justice system. So on January the 31st, I told the citizens of Illinois that I was going to impose a moratorium, because of the grave concerns I had about the state's shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting them on death row. I can't support that system. And its administration, it's proven to be very fraught with error, and it's come awful close to the ultimate nightmare."""

Over 1,000 Israelis were killed and countless thousands wounded – the equivalent of 42,000 fatalities and hundreds of thousands wounded in America if extrapolated from the population size. The situation was desperate….until they built their security fence. After construction of the fence, a double-layer barrier with a security zone in the middle – similar to the San Diego fence, suicide attacks perpetrated by Arab terrorists declined by well over 90%...   It has been said that no fence can stop the determination of illegal immigrants seeking job prospects or drug running and human trafficking opportunities. But nobody is more determined than Hamas terrorists willing to die for their cause of killing Jews. While nothing is full-proof, the double-layered security barrier stopped the terrorists; it will stop illegal immigration."""
10	Should the US Use Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) to Extract Natural Gas?	"""Fracking... imposes large costs on the public. We know that it produces toxic (and radioactive) wastewater that contaminates drinking water; there is reason to suspect, despite industry denials, that it also contaminates groundwater; and the heavy trucking required for fracking inflicts major damage on roads.  Economics 101 tells us that an industry imposing large costs on third parties should be required to 'internalize' those costs — that is, to pay for the damage it inflicts, treating that damage as a cost of production. Fracking might still be worth doing given those costs. But no industry should be held harmless from its impacts on the environment and the nation's infrastructure.  Yet what the industry and its defenders demand is, of course, precisely that it be let off the hook for the damage it causes. Why? Because we need that energy! For example, the industry-backed organization energyfromshale.org declares that 'there are only two sides in the debate: those who want our oil and natural resources developed in a safe and responsible way; and those who don't want our oil and natural gas resources developed at all.'  So it's worth pointing out that special treatment for fracking makes a mockery of free-market principles. Pro-fracking politicians claim to be against subsidies, yet letting an industry impose costs without paying compensation is in effect a huge subsidy. They say they oppose having the government 'pick winners,' yet they demand special treatment for this industry precisely because they claim it will be a winner.  So what you need to know is that nothing you hear from these people is true. Fracking is not a dream come true."""

01	Is the ACLU Good for America?	ACLU has been the pre-eminent protector of the individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights. Today, when there are many other legal organizations and public interest law firms that focus on constitutional issues and the rights of individuals, it can be easy to overlook the role that the ACLU played in defining how Americans understand individual liberty. We sometimes forget that the U.S. Constitution is not self-enforcing; that is, unless a lawsuit is brought that successfully asserts that a governmental action violates the Constitution or Bill of Rights, nothing will happen, and the violation will continue. That means that violations of the rights of people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer will not be redressed. In the 1920’s, when the ACLU was founded, there were no organizations willing to represent people without charge in order to insure government compliance with the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The ACLU represented workers trying to form unions, and was virtually the only predominantly white organization to oppose racism and denounce the then-resurgent Ku Klux Klan. The organization has been instrumental in a majority of important Supreme Court cases protecting free speech, religious liberty, due process and other important rights.”

Conversely, dairy-free diets may slow the progress of prostate cancer.  • Acne: Multiple studies have linked all types of cow's milk to an increased prevalence of acne in both boys and girls...  • Bone loss: Instead of promoting bone health, animal protein in dairy products can have a calcium-leaching effect.

01	Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy? - Top 3 Pros & Cons	"Denying student loan debtors the benefits of bankruptcy is unfair. The US Supreme Court said in 1915 that the benefits of bankruptcy allow debtors to ""start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities."" [8] Famous business leaders, from Henry Ford to President Donald Trump, have used bankruptcy for a fresh start. [9] Car loans, credit card charges, medical bills, and even gambling debts can be discharged in bankruptcy; not allowing educational debt to be discharged is unfair.

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	A meat-centered diet can help with weight loss. It takes fewer calories to get protein from lean meat than it does from vegetarian options. One serving of lean beef (3 oz.) contains as much protein as one serving of beans (1½ cups) or a veggie burger. However, the lean beef has half the calories of beans (180 vs. 374), and 50%-75% fewer calories than the veggie burger. [61] [15] Read More
10	Is There a Moral Difference between Passive and Active Euthanasia?	"""In the case of euthanasia...removing a machine is no different (functionally, morally metaphysically) from removing a biological bodily organ if both systems are performing the same role. Both are cases of disrupting some bodily process. If this disruption leads to death, then both are cases of killing...   Unnecessary suffering only seems to have weight when it is appealed to against technology, against artificiality, a common enough invocation in arguing to free patients from the 'trap of technology'... Even if the patient is in pain, has no chance for recovery, or has lost cognitive functions, no appeal to unnecessary suffering, no appeal to our being inhumane will currently, legally permit us to free this person from the trap of nature.   But if we are cruel in refusing to let nature free patients from the trap of technology, we are both cruel and conceptually blind when we refuse to let technology free patients from the trap of nature... When we remove machines playing these functional roles from hurting and hopeless patients, we kill those 'trapped by technology.' But this is not a bad thing. It is bad when we refuse to grant people trapped by nature the same benefit. """

10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""Drug use is a serious concern, not only for the concepts of integrity and fair play in competitive sports, but because of the health threats to the athletes.

Drug education programs must also continue in a further attempt to curtail the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs by empowering the young athlete with the information and skills to make responsible and healthy decisions."""
10	Should insider trading by Congress be allowed?	"""In my 1966 book [Insider Trading and the Stock Market] I said unequivocally that insider trading by any government officials on information received in the course of their work should be outlawed. The economic consequences of this trading on stock prices will be the same as any other informed trading, but there are many other aspects to the economic argument for legalizing insider trading generally that just will not pass the 'smell test' for government officials.  The compensation argument for corporate insider trading cuts in exactly the opposite direction for government officials. We do not want them to receive extra compensation or outside compensation for doing their jobs. And, of course, all too frequently their access to this information is merely another form of a bribe, and that sure as hell is not legal.  But proof will always be difficult (there are many ways government officials can hide the use of inside information, including using the information as a currency with which to pay off other contacts, thus avoiding buying or selling the securities themselves), and enforcement of any law against insider trading will be minimal at best. You can be sure that the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission] will not actively monitor Congressional trading, and the usual disclosure techniques will rarely elicit sufficient legal proof of a violation of the law.  Ultimately the only thing that will reduce the value of the use of inside information by government officials is for the government to be involved in far, far fewer matters than it is at present, thus curtailing the amount of valuable information the government can force out of citizens."""

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“[I]t cannot be argued that marriage between people of the same sex is un-American or threatens the rights of others. On the contrary, it seems to me that denying two consenting adults of the same sex the right to form a lawful union that is protected and respected by the state denies them two of the most basic natural rights affirmed in the preamble of our Declaration of Independence – liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, I believe, gives the argument of same sex marriage proponents its moral force… Opponents to giving women the vote argued such a change would undermine marriage and other social institutions. I think the institution would be strengthened by the inclusion of more couples who are genuinely committed to each other. But even if you believe marriage would be changed for the worse by same sex unions, I’m not sure it’s a compelling argument for their exclusion. We don’t forbid divorce, a more proven and prevalent threat to the health of our society… Marriage can be a profoundly gratifying state that strengthens the virtue of individuals and societies, and increases the measure and quality of the happiness we enjoy. It seems to me a terrible inequity that any person should be denied that responsibility, and the emotional enrichment it can provide. And I cannot in good conscience exclude anyone who is prepared for such a commitment from the prospect of such happiness.”
10	Is Sexual Orientation Determined at Birth?	some people are under the impression that sexual orientation is an innate, fixed, and biological trait of human beings — that, whether heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual, we are ‘born that way’ — there is insufficient scientific evidence to support that claim. In fact, the concept of sexual orientation itself is highly ambiguous; it can refer to a set of behaviors, to feelings of attraction, or to a sense of identity. Epidemiological studies show a rather modest association between genetic factors and sexual attractions or behaviors, but do not provide significant evidence pointing to particular genes. There is also evidence for other hypothesized biological causes of homosexual behaviors, attractions, or identity — such as the influence of hormones on prenatal development — but that evidence, too, is limited. Studies of the brains of homosexuals and heterosexuals have found some differences, but have not demonstrated that these differences are inborn rather than the result of environmental factors that influenced both psychological and neurobiological traits. One environmental factor that appears to be correlated with non-heterosexuality is childhood sexual abuse victimization, which may also contribute to the higher rates of poor mental health outcomes among non-heterosexual subpopulations, compared to the general population. Overall, the evidence suggests some measure of fluidity in patterns of sexual attraction and behavior — contrary to the ‘born that way’ notion that oversimplifies the vast complexity of human sexuality.”

Currently illegal aliens are supposed to receive a penalty of 6 months for illegally entering the United States, while those who 'aid and abet' those same illegal aliens can get up to five years. Does that make any sense?   The fact is that the lawbreaking illegal alien never receives that six month penalty. The local and state police can't be bothered with the court process and filling their jails with those who will only receive a 6 months jail sentence and be charged with fines they will never pay. If the penalty were harsher and enforced then perhaps illegal aliens will be more reluctant to defy our laws."""
01	Is Sexual Orientation Determined at Birth?	latest and best scientific evidence shows that sexual orientation and expressions of gender identity occur naturally, and pose no threat to societies in which they are accepted as normal variants of human sexuality… There is strong evidence that genes play a role in the determination of sexuality… There is other evidence that, during fetal development, exposure to certain hormones also plays a role… In addition, genetic and hormonal factors generally interact with environmental factors that have yet to be determined, though neither faulty parenting nor exposure to gay individuals causes homosexuality. The preponderance of opinion within the scientific community is that there is a strong biological component to sexual orientation and that genetic, hormonal and environmental factors interact to influence a person’s orientation. There is no scientific evidence that either homosexuality or heterosexuality is a freewill choice.”

Plants used in ethanol production harness the power of the sun to grow. By releasing the energy stored in corn and other feedstocks, ethanol production utilizes solar energy, replacing fossil energy use. A life cycle analysis of ethanol production - from the field to the vehicle - found that ethanol has a large and growing positive fossil energy balance.

That means fewer U.S. born workers are competing for jobs requiring less education, the kind immigrants generally get. So immigrants are replacing, not displacing U.S. born workers. This trend should continue. Of the top 10 occupations with the most projected employment growth, eight do not require a high school diploma, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics."""

So, why should we believe that cognitively disabled patients experience the deprivation differently simply because they receive nourishment through a feeding tube instead of by mouth?...   Yes, it is true that when people are actively dying from terminal disease, they often refuse food and water. The disease makes the food and water repulsive to them. In such circumstances, it is medically inappropriate to force food and water into a person who is actively rejecting it. Indeed, doing so could cause suffering.  But this isn't what is happening to Terri. She isn't dying of cancer. Her body isn't shutting down as part of the natural dying process.

The challenges frequently associated with nuclear power—high costs, waste disposal and proliferation risks—can all, from a technological perspective, be managed. The high cost concerns actually have little to do with the fuel used in a nuclear reactor—they're more related to the rising costs of concrete, steel, copper, and project capital on large, lengthy projects like a nuclear power plant. Many of these same cost concerns apply to virtually every means of generating electricity we have.

A child’s temperaments predispose him or her to enjoy some activities more than other activities. One child will enjoy rough-and-tumble play and competitive team sports (male-typical activities); another will prefer to socialize quietly or play jacks or hopscotch (female-type activities)… The most common reasons given by gay men and lesbians for having felt different from same-sex peers in childhood were sex-atypical preferences and behaviors in childhood–gender nonconformity. In fact, childhood gender conformity or nonconformity was not only the strongest but the only significant childhood predictor of later sexual orientation for both men and women.”
01	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""[T]he rapidly growing engagement of business, civil society, and government in devising and achieving a transition to a hydrogen economy is warranted and, if properly done, could yield important national and global benefits...  Hydrogen technologies are maturing. The world's existing hydrogen industry is starting to be recognized as big — producing one-fourth as much volume of gas each year as the global natural-gas industry. Industry, government, and civil society are becoming seriously engaged in designing a transition from refined petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity to hydrogen as the dominant way to carry, store, and deliver useful energy...  Hydrogen makes up about 75% of the known universe, but is not an energy source like oil, coal, wind, or sun. Rather, it is an energy carrier like electricity or gasoline — a way of transporting useful energy to users. Hydrogen is an especially versatile carrier because like oil and gas, but unlike electricity, it can be stored in large amounts (albeit often at higher storage cost than hydrocarbons), and can be made from almost any energy source and used to provide almost any energy service...  RMI's insights into the full economic value of distributed power suggest that hydrogen fuel cells today can economically displace less efficient central resources for delivering electricity, paving the way for hydrogen use to spread rapidly, financed by its own revenues...  The industrial infrastructure for centralized hydrogen production already exists. Throughout industry, most hydrogen is currently made at large plants and is used at the industrial site or nearby. There are ~1,500 km (~930 miles) of special hydrogen pipelines (720 km or 446 miles in North America) operating at up to 100 bar. Moving hydrogen gas through pipelines takes about half as much of its energy as is currently lost when transporting electricity."""

But the imposition of this punishment can be justified only if we make full use of all available tools to aid in the determination of guilt or innocence."""
01	Sanctuary Cities: Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Sanctuary policies are legal and protected by the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution provides for the separation of federal and state powers. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, the Amendment prevents the ""federal government from coercing state or local governments to use their resources to enforce a federal regulatory program, like immigration,"" and, thus, Congress cannot compel state or local governments to collect immigration status information in order to share it with the federal government. [4][7] Because the data are never collected due to ""don’t ask, don’t tell"" policies, the local and state governments are not in violation of federal law. [4]"

10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“[T]here is one cause of obesity and one only – eating too many calories. Certainly different bodies deal with food in different ways – some people seem able to eat a lot and stay thin whereas others appear to eat little and be overweight. But the fact remains that it is impossible to be obese unless one is taking in too many calories. Genetic, psychological and metabolic factors have all been blamed for obesity. But while these may help to explain why people eat too much, none of them are the cause. There are no medical conditions that cause obesity. Thyroid deficiency does leads to weight increase but, again, only if too many calories are eaten… We need an obesity strategy. It should say simply this: OBESITY IS KILLING MILLIONS, COSTING BILLIONS and the CURE is FREE. EAT LESS.”
10	Has Obamacare Increased Health Insurance Competition? - DEBATED	"""Months after the launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges, large insurance companies such as WellPoint still dominate many local markets -- although smaller insurers are challenging some of the biggest players in some markets, according to data from nine states analyzed by The Huffington Post...  While more than 120 insurance companies are offering coverage through the exchanges, the problem of poor competition isn't solved yet... And HuffPost's analysis comparing insurer market share between 2014 to date and 2011 shows the status quo is mostly holding in several states -- including Rhode Island, California and Connecticut -- where companies with the biggest market shares in 2011 are leading enrollments via the state's exchanges."""

10	Is the ACLU against Christmas or Other Religious Holidays?	recent years, culturally conservative commentators have declared that there is a so-called ‘war on Christmas,’ and in many cases have claimed that the ACLU is leading the charge. This simply isn’t true. Religious expression is a valued and protected part of the First Amendment rights guaranteed to us all. Christmas is pervasive in America, and, except when the government is being used to promote religious beliefs, it is entirely constitutional. While Christmas displays are being placed in front of homes, churches, and businesses across the country, and as carolers go door-to-door with songs of Christmas cheer, these culture warriors say that Christmas is being removed from all public mention and persist with such declarations about a ‘war on Christmas.’ The constitutional rights of people to worship, preach, sing carols, and celebrate Christmas in their churches and with their families and friends — whether in public or in private — is well-protected. The ACLU itself has brought several cases on behalf of people who want to celebrate Christmas. The real question is not whether people can celebrate Christmas (they most certainly can), but whether the government should be promoting religious beliefs and practices (it most certainly shouldn’t). When the smoke of battle clears, Christmas is completely safe.”

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Long ago the gold standard made sense for America, but not today. Its advocates want to turn the clock back to the ‘Roaring 20’s,’ but the economic growth of that decade had little to do with the gold standard and it ended in disaster. America has now been off the gold standard for 40 years and its many flaws have been forgotten. There are excellent reasons it was rejected by right wing icons such as Milton Friedman… Many economists believe adopting a gold standard could decrease the U.S. monetary supply by about half. This would cause massive deflation and could threaten an economic collapse… There is not enough gold in the world for it to be a medium of exchange… Using gold and silver is not going to prevent the government from making bad monetary decisions or creating more debt. The government could still spend too much and it would still have to contend with compounding debt and interest… Gold advocates claim it would give America a fixed monetary base, but gold flows can create huge swings in the broader money supply. Gold would not result in a stable monetary base. There has been a decades long search for price stability, but there are no stable commodities.”

This Court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying.

10	Should Healthcare Resources Be Subject to Rationing?	"""[Daniel] Callahan's call [to ration health care for the elderly] raises the problem known among ethicists and sociologists as the 'slippery slope.' Once the precept that one should do 'all one can' to avert death is given up, and attempts are made to fix a specific age for a full life, why stop there? If, for instance, the American economy experiences hard times in the 1990s, should the 'maximum' age be reduced to 72, 65--or lower? And should the care for other so-called unproductive groups be cut off, even if they are even younger? Should countries that are economically worse off than the United States set their limit, say, at 55?...   In addition to concern about slipping down the slope of less (and less) care, the way the limitations are to be introduced raises a serious question. The advocates of changing the intergenerational allocation of resources favoring rationing health care for the elderly but nothing else. This is a major intellectual weakness of their argument. There are other major targets to consider within health care, as well as other areas, which seem, at least by some criteria, much more inviting than terminating care to those above a certain age. Within the medical sector, for example, why not stop all interventions for which there is no hard evidence that they are beneficial... Why not take the $2 billion or so from plastic surery dedicated to face lifts, reducing behinds and the like?...   If we cannot stop people from blowing $25 billion per year on cigarettes and convince them to use the money to serve the young, shouldn't we at least cut out public subsidies to tobacco growers before we save funds by denying antibiotics to old people? And there is the matter of profits. The high-technology medicine Callahan targets for savings is actually a minor cause of the increase in health care costs for the elderly or for anyone--about 4 percent. A major factor is the very high standard of living American doctors have, compared to those of many other nations... Another important area of saving is the exorbitant profits made by the nondoctor owners of dialysis units and nursing homes. If we dare ask how many years of life are enough, should we not also be able to ask how much profit is 'enough'? This profit, by the way, is largely set not by the market but by public policy."""

Legalize it, and you give law-abiding enterprises a chance to compete...   Moreover, regulated brothels now are operated as legitimate businesses, and so attract professional managers -- as opposed to underworld thugs...

Topping the child pill category is–another surprise!–ADHD meds, though kids increasingly take blood pressure, diabetes and insomnia meds too. (Babies are actually given GERD medicine for spitting up.) Twenty percent of the population is now on five or more prescription medications. Ka-ching. DTC advertising has done two pernicious things. It has created a nation of hypochondriacs with depression, bipolar disorder, GERD, Restless Legs, insomnia, seasonal allergies and assorted pain, mood and ‘risk’ conditions and it has reduced doctors to order takers and gate keepers. Thanks to TV drug ads, patients tell doctors what is wrong with them and what pill they need, coupon in hand. Drug company-funded web sites even give patients talking points to use when they see the doctor, lest they don’t ring up a sale. Selling prescription drugs like soap makes a mockery of a medical school education.”

Many pro golfers smoked while playing (Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Fuzzy Zoeller) or smoked and drank while playing (John Daly). [73] Read More
10	Is Life in Prison without Parole a Better Option Than the Death Penalty?	"""Death penalty opponents often argue that executing criminals is a needless act of inhumanity, since the threat of a sentence of life without parole is just as effective a deterrent to crime. Whatever one thinks of that claim in the abstract, the fact is that no jury has the legal authority to prevent government officials years or decades in the future from offering clemency or parole after all -- or to prevent judges at some later date from finding grounds for a new trial...  Anti-death-penalty groups know, of course, that there is no guarantee that a sentence of life without parole will actually be followed. Potential killers likely know it too. Those of us who believe that the punishment should in some since fit the crime may doubt the prospect of spending two or even more decades behind bars, with the hope of ultimate emancipation... constitutes just retribution for an act of cold-blooded murder... And in a society that doubts its right to impose the ultimate penalty on individuals who have committed the most vicious crimes against their fellow citizens, the horror against committing murder will tend inevitably to erode."""

Yet, nearly 80 percent of these cases are ending with DHS [Department of Homeland Security] ordering these same families deported back to the very dangerous conditions they fled. Disturbingly, it has been reported that as many as 83 Central American immigrants recently denied asylum were murdered within months of their return…   I urge you to immediately end these raids and not deport families back to countries where a death sentence awaits.

Issuers of insurance plans that cover abortions in state exchanges are supposed to collect from enrollees a 'separate payment' for abortion coverage (i.e., the abortion premium) and a 'separate payment' for everything else. Federal funds should only be comingled with the second pot of money.  The language in the law is unambiguous — 'separate payments' are required. Yet, insurance issuers are not collecting separate payments...  Further, under the ACA the abortion premium is supposed to be 'segregated' from any federal subsidies, with issuers filing 'segregation plans' with their state health-insurance commissioner explaining how they will maintain the integrity of taxpayer funding...  [A]t least one state department of insurance was unaware that issuers needed to file their plans for segregating the abortion premium from taxpayer funds with the state.

10	Binge-Watching - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Binge-watching leads to serious physical health problems. Binge-watching requires sitting for hours and hours, which has long been linked to slow metabolism, heart disease, cancer, blood clots, and deep vein thrombosis. [21] [22] If the viewer is hooked on a show, they're more likely to sit on the couch eating unhealthy food and snacking more, which is linked to weight gain and damaged arteries. [22] [23] One study found that binge-watching was related to poorer sleep quality, more fatigue, and insomnia, because of pre-sleep arousal. In other words, getting very invested in the characters and plot of multiple episodes of TV right before bed leaves the viewer thinking about the show more and unable to sleep. [5] A survey found that 45.1% stayed awake all night to binge-watch a show. [24] Researchers have also found that watching three or more hours of TV a day is associated with premature death. [25]

There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way people view the conflict and ways to solve it. That involves acknowledging that Israel has created a one-state reality, and finding ways to make that state equitable rather than a vehicle for the apartheid system that exists today.  This is actually easier than with two states, because issues of separation - borders, settlements, East Jerusalem, resources - no longer become the insurmountable obstacles they currently are.  Nevertheless, the debate over the desirability of one state for both peoples is moot given that the two-state solution is no longer feasible."""

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Violent video games may decrease crime because people are busy playing the games instead of committing violent acts. Some researchers say that violent people often seek out violent video games, and that the time they spend playing the games is taking them off the streets, leading to decreased crime. This is known as the ""incapacitation effect."" [84] Steven Levitt, PhD, economics professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of Freakonomics, stated, ""It just stands to reason that if you find an activity that keeps potential criminals busy for six waking hours a day, then it probably makes sense that they're going to be doing less crime."" [89] One study estimated that this effect leads to about ten fewer crimes per day nationwide. [90] Read More"
10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“When we meet obese people, should we cast them a knowing glance of concern and ask how they are doing? Should we send flowers and ‘get well soon’ cards to obese family members and friends?… If obesity truly is a disease, then over 78 million adults and 12 million children in America just got classified as sick… Everyone has friends and acquaintances who now qualify as diseased. Yet many sensible people, from physicians to philosophers, know that declaring obesity a disease is a mistake. Simply put, obesity is not a disease. To be sure, it is a risk factor for some diseases. But it would be as false to say that everyone who is obese is sick as to say that every normal-weight person is well.”
01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“I think that this president will be seen as one of the most highly qualified, most talented, most skilled political leaders that this country has ever seen. In that measuring stick, he is up there, in my view, with the Ronald Reagan capacity to communicate with the nation, with the John Kennedy capacity to inspire a generation. I think he probably had more sense of politics and policy than we’ll ever see again in a president, and more intelligence about dealing with it. I think people will be talking about William Jefferson Clinton as a president and as a person forever because of the combination of incredible forces that are wrapped up in this man. And we know about the flaws. And we know about the lost promise. And we know about the squandered opportunities. But they also shouldn’t conceal the reality that this was a time of enormous achievement and transformation of the nation…: the diversity, the commitment to diversity, to recognizing and celebrating diversity in our country, to dealing with the post Cold War era in a way that made sense. Where the country was not afraid of exercising leadership, of projecting power and influence at the same time that it developed a very powerful economy at home.”
10	Does Obamacare Fund Abortion Services for Cases Other Than Rape, Incest, or to Save the Life of the Mother? - DEBATED	"""Since 1977, federal law has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, unless the pregnancy is a result of rape, incest, or if it is determined to endanger the woman's life. This rule, also known as the Hyde Amendment, is not a permanent law; rather it has been attached annually to Congressional appropriations bills, and has been approved every year by the Congress...  The ACA reinforces the current Hyde Amendment restrictions, continuing to limit federal funds to pay for pregnancy terminations that endanger the life of the woman or that are a result of rape or incest... State Medicaid programs continue to have the option to cover abortions in other circumstances using only state funds and no federal funds. President Obama issued an executive order as part of health reform that restated the federal limits specifically for Medicaid coverage of abortion."""

10	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""There are many different ways of disenfranchising a person using a voter-verified paper trail. First, people can be disenfranchised in all the normal ways. They can have registrations problems; they can have valid design problems, polling place problems, etc. Second, the paper trail can be lost, stolen, or added to. Third, the equipment can be designed or accidentally set up so it doesn't work, or it slowly changes itself. Finally intentional fraud can be widespread and created in software in such a way that it can be hidden from the voter and from the ballot worker on the day of election and not be remedied later. The final problem is that counting paper cannot be done at the accuracy level that electronic counting can be done. In this way, even if everything is performed correctly, the difficulty of counting the paper electronically will make it impossible to compare electronic outputs with the paper outputs in a way that can determine whether an accurate count has been achieved...  Furthermore, VVPT complicates...the setup, teardown, and operations of the ballot place. It complicates polling place procedures during the vote. It gives extra and difficult tasks for a person to do and increases the problems with the user experience and the user interface. It also increases the length of time of voting, which makes it, with more steps, easier to make mistakes."""
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Obamacare is the single worst piece of legislation that's been passed in the last half-century.

A twenty-seven hundred page bill that wreaks havoc with the private health insurance market, and in the end, doesn't get everybody covered in the first place. Now that is not my view of how to improve the American health care delivery system. If we had the ability to do it, we ought to pull it out root and branch and start over."""
10	Ride-Hailing Apps Such as Uber and Lyft - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Ride-hailing drivers earn low pay that is often below minimum wage. As contract workers, drivers don't receive employee benefits. They also pay for gas and car maintenance, something 44% of drivers say they have a hard time affording. [15][16][17] The Economic Policy Institute says that ""Uber drivers earn less than what 90 percent of workers earn,"" and their hourly compensation ""falls below the mandated minimum wage in nine of 20 major markets."" [15] A 2018 report from economists at UC Berkeley and the New School found that 40% of ride-hailing drivers ""have incomes so low they qualify for Medicaid and another 16 percent have no health insurance; 18 percent qualify for federal supplemental nutrition assistance (nearly twice the rate for New York City workers overall)."" [18] Half of ride-hailing drivers are the main earners for their families and are supporting children [18] Given a median hourly pay of $14.73 for Uber drivers, a 40-hour work week would result in an annual salary of close to $31,000 before vehicle expenses, and about $20,000 after accounting for costs incurred by drivers - right at the poverty threshold for a family of three.

10	Should the United States Authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline to Import Tar Sand Oil from Canada?	"""One month ago, more than 100 North American climate scientists and I warned President Obama and Secretary Kerry that they should reject the proposed Keystone XL pipeline – indeed, that it would greaten the risk of dangerous and potentially irreversible climate changes...   So why on earth is a group of US Senators - mostly Republicans, but a handful of Democrats, too - still trying to circumvent the approval process and double down on climate change generating fossil fuels?...   To those elected officials who believe we should build the Keystone XL pipeline, I ask: Are you committed to keeping global warming below dangerous levels? If so, are you advocating for a moratorium on all other sources of fossil fuel energy? Are you ready for no more coal mining, no more natural gas extraction and no more oil drilling? Because that is what would likely be required if were to avoid truly dangerous changes to our climate and still approve the pipeline...   [B]uilding the Keystone XL pipeline simply makes no sense. It represents an investment in infrastructure that will lock in decades of extraction of dirty, expensive fossil fuels at a time when we need to be rapidly pivoting away from a fossil fuel-driven energy economy."""

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""[A]lternative energy sources have some way to go before they can make substantial contributions to the world's future energy mix, given the current state of their development and the various hurdles they still face. We must also remember that many of these alternatives, such as nuclear or renewables, or even conventional sources such as coal, may be able to meet additional demand in power generation and possibly industry but not in transportation, which of course is a key sector of oil utilization.  Alternatives and their contributions to meeting steadily rising energy demand are needed and welcome, and eventually these fuel sources will become a more important component of global energy supplies. But we must be realistic about the pace of their future development, and understand that for the foreseeable future, their significance in the energy supply mix will continue to be limited."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""The studies reviewed in this report indicate that alternatives cannot provide significant amounts of liquid fuels. Thus it is not feasible to ramp up alternatives to replace oil, even if there are decades to prepare for the occurrence of Peak Oil. There are no significant mitigation options on the supply side regarding the Peak Oil crisis...  Solar power, nuclear energy, and coal are primarily useful for generating electric power, but these energies do not provide liquid fuels needed for transportation or mechanized agriculture, nor do they provide raw materials for manufacturing of 300,000 products, including fertilizer. Electric power from solar, coal, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion will therefore not solve the nation's energy problems...  Because leaders lack a basic understanding of energy sources, the nation will continue to direct attention toward the hydrogen economy, corn ethanol, wind power, and solar energy – even though the most authoritative sources conclude that these are not solutions for the liquid fuels problems facing the nation."""

10	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“Medical and scientific research, as well as overwhelming clinical reports, have clearly demonstrated the potential for risk posed by many commonly administered vaccines. These same reports have indicated that the effectiveness of many of these vaccines has not been adequately proven. Based on such evidence, doctors of chiropractic have been joined by progressive medical doctors and public health administrators in questioning public policy regarding mandatory vaccines… It is the position of The World Chiropractic Alliance that… No person should be forced by government regulation or societal pressure to receive any medication or treatment, including vaccines, against his or her will. This includes mandated vaccines as a requirement for public school admission or for employment eligibility.”
01	Should Marijuana Ever Be Used to Treat Children and Adolescents?	evidence from culture in which children are provided with cannabis [marijuana] for therapeutic purposes (e.g., Jamaica) has failed to detect any specific adverse effects from such use. Moreover, there is powerful anecdotal evidence that some children with hyperactivity or aggressiveness can benefit substantially from cananbis medicines (in non-smoked forms). When used in small doses as directed, cannabis is a much milder drug than Ritalin or many of the other powerful psychotropic agents commonly prescribed for such children these days. Also, one study found that a cannabinoid (delta-8 THC) was safe and effective for treatment of nausea and anorexia due to cancer chemotherapy in children.”
10	Is the ACLU Anti-Christian?	shudder when fellow Christians blithely dismiss the organization as fundamentally biased against them. Some call it the Anti-Christian Liberals Union or the Anti-Christian Litigation Unit. There are other, less friendly acronyms as well. I think the ACLU is wrong to oppose religious expression in the public square, but being wrong is not the same as being evil. More to the point, the ACLU is often right about the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, taking on fights that others refuse. It might surprise some critics that the ACLU defends the free speech and free exercise rights of, well, Christians… The next time a fellow Christian disparages the ACLU, try answering with something like this: ‘Sure, they’re on the wrong side sometimes, but I thank God for the times when they’re right.'”

Now, the 'no, we can't' crowd will spin out doomsday scenarios about runaway costs.

01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“In the early 1970s, I learned about the horrors of intensive animal production… This happened suddenly as a result of reading Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation. I had never heard of a factory farm before and as I turned the pages I became increasingly incredulous, horrified and angry… I can still remember how I felt when I closed Singer’s book. I thought about the delicious pork chops that I loved, the heavenly smell of frying bacon in the morning. And all the roast chicken, casseroled chicken, fried chicken, and chicken soup that I had enjoyed during my life… When I saw meat on my plate, from that moment on, I should think of pain-fear-death. How horrible. And so it was clear. I would eat no more meat. The good news is that vegetarian – and vegan – food is not only good for the environment, the welfare of animals, and human health, but it is also delicious when properly cooked… I recognize that, for many people, giving up meat would be extremely hard. But if everyone knew and faced up to all the facts, most would either opt for drastically cutting their meat consumption and eating only free-range animals, or giving up meat altogether. For the mass production of meat on intensive farms is taking its toll not only, as we have seen, on the well-being of the animal victims, but also on human health. And it is wreaking havoc on the environment whether the animals are factory-farmed or grazed.”
01	Should Cannabidiol (CBD) Be a Medical Option?	(CBD), a constituent of herbal cannabis, has attracted much interest recently as a promising medicine. After being discovered in the early 1970s it was quickly established that CBD has anti-convulsant and anxiolytic properties in animal models and in humans… Work in the 1980s and early 1990s suggested CBD had anti-psychotic properties and could be an effective treatment for schizophrenia… In the last decade or so many other properties of CBD have been characterised… CBD has potent anti-inflammatory properties and is a neuroprotectant… CBD appears to protect, not just neurons, but heart muscle from injury. Several groups in the US and UK are pursuing this line which has massive implications for clinical practice. Perhaps even more dramatic is recent work from Mechoulam’s lab which suggests that CBD can restore normal pancreatic functioning in models of type 1 diabetes. The list of putative indications for CBD include… Neuropsychiatric Anti-inflammatory Neuroprotectant Cardioprotectant Malignancy CBD exhibits an impressive plethora of therapeutic uses, including anticonvulsive, sedative, hypnotic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. CBD is well tolerated in humans, with a profile of very low toxicity, and is devoid of psychoactive and cognitive effects.”
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“The lack of tenure, of due process, of any requirement that a school district only fire teachers for some actual legitimate reason — it interferes with teachers’ ability to do the job they were hired to do. It forces teachers to work under a chilling cloud where their best professional judgment, their desire to advocate for and help students, their ability to speak out and stand up are all smothered by people with the power to say, ‘Do as I tell you, or else.’ Civilians need to understand — the biggest problem with the destruction of tenure is not that a handful of teachers will lose their jobs, but that entire buildings full of teachers will lose the freedom to do their jobs well… Teachers, who answer to a hundred different bosses, need their own special set of protections. Not to help them keep the job, but to help them do it. The public needs the assurance that teachers will not be protected from the consequences of incompetence (and administrators really need to step up — behind every teacher who shouldn’t have a job are administrators who aren’t doing theirs). But the public also needs the assurance that some administrator or school board member or powerful citizen will not interfere with the work the public hired the teacher to do. Tenure is that assurance. Without tenure, every teacher is the pawn and puppet of whoever happens to be the most powerful person in the building today.”
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“[California] cannot show a direct causal link between violent video games and harm to minors… California relies on the research of Craig Anderson and a few other research psychologists whose studies purport to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children. These studies have been rejected by every court to consider them, and with good reason: They do not prove that violent video games cause minors to act aggressively (which would at least be a beginning). Instead, ‘[n]early all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology’ [quoting from Video Software Dealers Association 556 f. 3d, at 964] “ [Editor’s Note: This decision overturned a law passed in California that restricted the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.]
01	Are Votes Cast on Electronic Voting Machines Stored in a Manner That Preserves Voter Anonymity?	"""Since the AVC Edge retains a ballot image record for each voter, it is important that these ballot images not be saved in the order in which they were cast as that would provide the ability to learn how an individual cast their vote. When the AVC Edge allocates storage space for ballot images and write-in data, it takes the following steps to assure storage of this data is sufficiently random to avoid identification of voter data with individual voters:  1. Storage space is allocated in large blocks rather than on a per-voter basis. When an allocation is required, a random number of storage blocks between 50 and 100 are allocated.  2. Access to the storage blocks is via an indirect table of block numbers. This table is shuffled randomly when the blocks are allocated, so that the sequence of storing ballot images with the storage blocks is random.  The randomizing function in the AVC Edge uses a mathematical pseudo-random number generator that is further randomized by the value of the AVC Edge's internal real time clock at a the time of the random number request. The pseudo-random number generator has been reviewed by independent computer experts and been deemed sufficiently random that it would not reasonably be reversible based on the amount of data that would serve as the bases for the reversal."""
10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“One must ask, beyond the basic right to bear arms, why we need to legalize and make it easier to conceal them for those whose motives may not be pure to carry a weapon into a playground or a crowded stadium… Do we want to set in motion a situation in already overarmed and overweaponized cities in which some of us for whatever reasons find it necessary to conceal a weapon from the rest of us and do it with the blessings of the federal government. Do we want to raise our children to believe that you have to carry a gun to protect yourself from people who may be carrying guns?… Who do we really think will be carrying that Glock 39 into a playground or a stadium, a church, a synagogue, or a mosque? It will not be me, and certainly will not be Governor Corzine or any of my colleagues. It will not be anyone in this room. It may very well be the white supremacist who allegedly murdered three Pittsburgh police officers on his front porch with an AK-47. The suicide shooter who murdered ten in an Alabama rampage. The Minnesota man charged with murdering his wife. They were all concealed permit holders.”
10	Are Living Wills a Good Idea?	"""Living wills negate informed consent. Since no one knows the future, by definition their care or noncare instructions must generally be written. Thus, when an incapacitation occurs, the patient's feelings and desires about this specific circumstance may not be known. The living will puts tremendous power into the hands of doctors, who are empowered to decide whether and when the living will takes effect, when treatment should be withdrawn or withheld. Moreover, the decision regarding the type and extent of medical intervention to be withheld is the doctor's. And this power isn't restricted to 'extraordinary care' such as ventilators to assist with breathing, but to any medical intervention--from not treating a curable bacterial infection to withdrawing food and fluids so that the patient starves and dehydrates to death. Thus, with a living will, the check of informed consent is surrendered to medicalized decision making."
10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“I often compare obesity to drowning. Would we consider it a disease if a person were drowning? When someone is drowning, it’s not a problem with their body: Humans cannot be in the water for an arbitrary amount of time, so the problem is a mismatch between the body and the body’s environment. I think drowning and obesity share many important characteristics. Both are about an interaction between a perfectly healthy body and the challenge of an environment in which they are maladapted. In both cases, you’re exposed to something that’s initially a good thing, but you’re exposed to too much of it for too long. In the case of water, you need it, but too much of it for too long and you drown. In the case of food, if you eat too much of it for too long, then you get fat. In both cases, absolutely everybody is vulnerable, but people are vulnerable to varying degrees. If we’re put underwater, eventually all of us will drown, but some of us are able to hold our breath longer than others. I think that’s true about obesity: About 80 percent of the adult population of the United States is either overweight or obese. That indicates that essentially, we’re all vulnerable, but we’re not all vulnerable to the same degree.”
01	Should the ACLU Challenge Government Sponsorship of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA)?	the ACLU considers ‘warrant for legal action’ is the government’s support for discrimination against two groups of citizens: atheists and gays… [S]hould the government provide active aid, assistance, support, and financing to organizations that discriminate against classes of citizens based upon stereotypes and prejudices?… More direct pressure from groups like the ACLU may be the only recourse that public democracy has — which may be why conservatives like Zeiger call them a ‘monster.’ They, after all, place the public goods of equality and citizenship above the private prejudices of bigotry and ‘values.'”

01	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Poor people are impacted by biofuels as consumers in food and energy markets, producers of agricultural commodities in small businesses, and workers in labor markets. The increase in agricultural demand and the resulting increase in agricultural prices will affect poor people in different ways. Some poor farmers could gain from this price increase. However, net buyers of food, which represent the majority of poor people, would respond to high food prices with reduced consumption and changed patterns of demand, leading to calorie and nutrition deficiencies...  Food-calorie consumption will fall the most in Sub-Saharan Africa, where calorie consumption is projected to decrease by more than 8 percent if biofuels expand drastically...  As a result of rising food prices, cuts will likely be made to food expenditures, exacerbating diet quality and micronutrient malnutrition. A study of the effects in an East Asian setting suggests that a 50-percent increase in the price of food, holding income constant, will lead to the decline of iron intake by 30 percent. As a result, the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency among women and children will increase by 25 percent (Bouis 2008)."""

Another 448 megawatts of conventional hydropower and 2,783 megawatts of pumped storage are before the commission in the pre-filing stage, before a license application is submitted...  Electricity generated by conventional hydropower and new ocean, tidal, and in-stream hydrokinetic resources reduces the need for additional generation from fossil fuels and avoids the emissions associated with those resources...

More people would vote if they had more time to cast their ballots… Furthermore, celebrating our democracy publicly would send the message that we value each other’s citizenship as much as we value honoring past presidents.” [13] Donald Green, PhD, Burgess Professor of Political Science at Columbia University, found that nonpartisan community parties celebrating Election Day in 2005, 2006, and 2016 increased voter participation between 2.6 percentage points and about 4 percentage points.

01	Are Mass Deportations a Good Method to Address Illegal Immigration?	"""As I have said repeatedly, our borders are not open to illegal migration; if you come here illegally, we will send you back consistent with our laws and values…   This should come as no surprise. I have said publicly for months that individuals who constitute enforcement priorities, including families and unaccompanied children, will be removed…   I know there are many who loudly condemn our enforcement efforts as far too harsh, while there will be others who say these actions don't go far enough. I also recognize the reality of the pain that deportations do in fact cause. But, we must enforce the law consistent with our priorities. At all times, we endeavor to do this consistent with American values, and basic principles of decency, fairness, and humanity."""
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v. Wade has deformed a great nation. The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. It has aggravated the derogation of the father’s role in an increasingly fatherless society. It has portrayed the greatest of gifts – a child – as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically-dependent sons and daughters. And, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners. Human rights are not a privilege conferred by government. They are every human being’s entitlement by virtue of his humanity. The right to life does not depend, and must not be declared to be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or a sovereign.”

01	Do Athletes Gain an Unfair Advantage by Using Performance Enhancing Drugs?	"""The objects of doping control are clear. The essence of a sporting contest is that it should be fairly conducted, with the competitor's success or failure being the result of natural talents: speed, skill, endurance, tactical awareness - honed, it may be, by instruction, training and body maintenance in its widest sense. The much used metaphor - a level playing field - derives from sport. The use of drugs violates all such notions of equality: the drug taker starts with an unfair advantage. Success becomes the product of the test tube, not the training track. The interests of innocent athletes need protection by punishment of the guilty."""
01	Saturday Halloween - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"A Saturday Halloween would minimize the holiday's negative impact on schools and learning. When Halloween falls on a weekday, students are too distracted to learn. [11] Halloween parties and parades at school exclude kids whose cultures don't celebrate or whose parents can't afford nice costumes. [14] School day Halloween celebrations, which may have sweet treats and loud music, raise potential issues for students with serious food allergies, kids on the autism spectrum, and those with anxiety. [15][16] Students and even teachers sometimes cause disruptions by wearing costumes that are inappropriate, racist, or just plain too scary. [17][18][19] Teachers also struggle to keep students focused the day after Halloween, when they have to wrangle tired and cranky kids. [11] Retired teacher Cookie Knisbaum stated that kids are ""going to be hyped-up from the day before, and they're going to try to bring their candy with them."" [20] Moving Halloween to a Saturday would get the holiday out of the classroom and allow families to decide if and how they want to celebrate."

Today I see reports coming all the time that acknowledge cannabis cardiovascular risks, and the situation may be different.”
01	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	Students who own tablets purchase and read more books than those who read print books alone.

One might speculate then on why they try to keep the source code confidential. The uncharitable view, which appears to have some justification, is that they don't want the public to see how bad their code is. A legitimate reason might be to avoid making matters easy for competitors, but that does not justify withholding information from the public that is necessary to promote confidence in the electoral process...  There is no reason that the ballot setup, display, tabulation and reporting sections of the voting system code should be kept secret, and manufacturers would be wise to accede to public demand in this regard."""
10	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	Taxes: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the gasoline tax by 4.3 cents per gallon, which directly impacted the middle class. [42] The 1993 tax hikes cannot be credited with the economic boom of the 1990s: it was after the Republican Congress passed tax cuts in 1997 that the economy really became stronger and the budget was balanced.

The IOC added that statement after the Jerome Young verdict which still shouldn't affect us because that was 5 years after the Sydney Games.

I'm sure some cops, lawyers and judges sometimes enter this market, but they can never admit it because it would undercut their authority to arrest, prosecute and punish those who gave them release the day before.  Whether one pays to participate in an orgy or to hire the services of a prostitute, I see no reason to bring in the heavy guns of the criminal law. When it comes to sex, I see only one legal rule of any real importance: for sex to be lawful there only needs to be consent, and it should not matter whether consent is secured by direct payment or weeks of expensive courtship with fine dining and false promises."""

10	Has DNA Testing Led to Significant Improvements in the Criminal Justice System?	"""Good DNA material is available in only one in five felony cases: often there is not enough DNA for a sample, or it is old or contaminated. And it is not necessarily proof of guilt or innocence. You can commit vicious crimes without leaving physical evidence behind (as some argue the teenagers did in the Central Park rape case).  Although DNA tests back up convictions roughly half the time, politicians have been slow to embrace a tool that has mainly hit the headlines when it has revealed miscarriages of justice. As recently as 1999, only two states had laws allowing post-conviction DNA tests. Twenty-six have such laws now, but many impose arbitrary restrictions. In Kentucky, only inmates on death row qualify for a post-conviction DNA analysis. And getting such analysis is a haphazard business. Mr King's reprieve was the result of a month-long campaign, at the end of which Mr Scheck (who defended O.J. Simpson) inveigled his way into the governor's office.  Cost plays a part. Laboratory tests on older forensic evidence can cost thousands of dollars. But the main reason seems to be fear. For law-enforcers, DNAanalysis is a Pandora's box: each new 'criminal' proved innocent opens up more doubts about the system that convicted him."""

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Though I was once California's biggest proponent of the death penalty, I now feel compelled to admit the policy is destructive to our great state. What we didn't know then is that the death penalty would become an industry that benefits only attorneys and criminals, and no one else. It's an extreme expense to taxpayers, does not make our communities safer and fails to deliver the justice it promised.  Since the initiative became law, California taxpayers have unknowingly spent more than $5 billion to maintain a death row that now houses 747 convicted criminals. During this time, only 13 people have been put to death, at an eye-popping price tag of $384 million per execution...  New studies conclusively show that the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime. My family and I believed the death penalty would serve as the ultimate warning to criminals, but nearly 40 years of evidence proves it does not work."""

Any Palestinian state would have to be demilitarized, and who, really, would accept that—that's not sovereignty, that's (at best) autonomy, and if you're going to be merely autonomous, why even uphold the fiction of statehood?  Think about it: If you had been militarily occupied and attacked for years by the same country, would you accept a 'sovereign' state which had no ability to defend itself? Palestinians, furthermore, don't just have every reason to be wary of Israel's intentions, and its powerful military, but of many of their neighbors' as well...

10	Should the US Use Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) to Extract Natural Gas?	"""Many fracking additives are toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic. Many are kept secret. In the United States, such secrecy has been abetted by the 2005 'Halliburton loophole,' which exempts fracking from many of the nation's major federal environmental-protection laws, including the Safe Drinking Water Act... Fracking extracts natural salts, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and radioactive materials from the shale, posing risks to ecosystems and public health when these return to the surface. This flowback is collected in open pits or large tanks until treated, recycled or disposed of. Because shale-gas development is so new, scientific information on the environmental costs is scarce. Only this year have studies begun to appear in peer-reviewed journals, and these give reason for pause. We call for a moratorium on shale-gas development [which requires fracking for extraction] to allow for better study of the cumulative risks to water quality, air quality and global climate. Only with such comprehensive knowledge can appropriate regulatory frameworks be developed...  [S]hale gas competes for investment with green energy technologies, slowing their development and distracting politicians and the public from developing a long-term sustainable energy policy. With time, perhaps engineers can develop more appropriate ways to handle fracking-fluid return wastes, and perhaps the technology can be made more sustainable and less polluting in other ways. Meanwhile, the gas should remain safely in the shale, while society uses energy more efficiently and develops renewable energy sources more aggressively."""

On the other hand, it is equally meaningful to speak of the ‘culture’ of homosexuality in animals, since the extent and range of variation that is found (between individuals or populations or species) exceeds that provided by genetic programming and begins to enter the realm of individual habits, learned behaviors, and even community-wide ‘traditions.'”

01	Is Expanding Nuclear Energy Production Necessary to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""In the early 1970s when I helped found Greenpeace, I believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with nuclear holocaust, as did most of my compatriots. That's the conviction that inspired Greenpeace's first voyage up the spectacular rocky northwest coast to protest the testing of U.S. hydrogen bombs in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. Thirty years on, my views have changed, and the rest of the environmental movement needs to update its views, too, because nuclear energy may just be the energy source that can save our planet from another possible disaster: catastrophic climate change.  Look at it this way: More than 600 coal-fired electric plants in the United States produce 36 percent of U.S. emissions -- or nearly 10 percent of global emissions -- of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. Nuclear energy is the only large-scale, cost-effective energy source that can reduce these emissions while continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power...  Wind and solar power have their place, but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply can't replace big baseload plants such as coal, nuclear and hydroelectric. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is too expensive already, and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants. Given that hydroelectric resources are built pretty much to capacity, nuclear is, by elimination, the only viable substitute for coal. It's that simple...  [T]he 103 nuclear plants operating in the United States effectively avoid the release of 700 million tons of CO2 emissions annually -- the equivalent of the exhaust from more than 100 million automobiles. Imagine if the ratio of coal to nuclear were reversed so that only 20 percent of our electricity was generated from coal and 60 percent from nuclear. This would go a long way toward cleaning the air and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Every responsible environmentalist should support a move in that direction."""

10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Raising the minimum wage is a formula for causing unemployment among the least-skilled members of society. The higher wages are, the higher costs of production are. The higher costs of production are, the higher prices are. The higher prices are, the smaller are the quantities of goods and services demanded and the number of workers employed in producing them… [T]he higher the minimum wage is raised, the worse are the effects on poor people. This is because, on the one hand, the resulting overall unemployment is greater, while, on the other hand, the protection a lower wage provides against competition from higher-paid workers is more and more eroded. At today’s minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, workers earning that wage are secure against the competition of workers able to earn $8, $9, or $10 per hour. If the minimum wage is increased… to $10.10 per hour, and the jobs that presently pay $7.25 had to pay $10.10, then workers who previously would not have considered those jobs because of their ability to earn $8, $9, or $10 per hour will now consider them… The effect is to expose the workers whose skills do not exceed a level corresponding to $7.25 per hour to the competition of better educated, more-skilled workers presently able to earn wage rates ranging from just above $7.25 to just below $10.10 per hour.”

That would turn the ‘right’ to bear arms into a mere ‘privilege.’ Likewise, one should not have to be photographed, fingerprinted, or registered before they can exercise their Second Amendment rights.

10	Is There a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""In the recent bioethics literature some have endorsed physician-assisted suicide but not euthanasia. Are they sufficiently different that the moral arguments for one often do not apply to the other? A paradigm case of physician-assisted suicide is a patient's ending his or her life with a lethal dose of a medication requested of and provided by a physician for that purpose. A paradigm case of voluntary active euthanasia is a physician's administering the lethal dose, often because the patient is unable to do so. The only difference that need exist between the two is the person who actually administers the lethal dose - the physician or the patient. In each, the physician plays an active and necessary causal role.  In physician-assisted suicide the patient acts last (for example, Janet Adkins herself pushed the button after Dr. Kevorkian hooked her up to his suicide machine), whereas in euthanasia the physician acts last by performing the physical equivalent of pushing the button. In both cases, however, the choice rests fully with the patient. In both the patient acts last in the sense of retaining the right to change his or her mind until the point at which the lethal process becomes irreversible. How could there be a substantial moral difference between the two based only on this small difference in the part played by the physician in the causal process resulting in death?"""

And it's time to get immediate results...  The Guard is going to support border control efforts. And the Border Patrol, of course, will be in the lead. The Guard will operate surveillance and communications systems. They will install fences and vehicle barriers. They're going to help build patrol roads. They'll analyze intelligence.

Continuing this selective interpretation of civil rights, the ACLU, who loves them some hate crime laws, now doesn’t love hate crime laws if they are used to protect police officers. The ACLU has a long history of supporting hate crime laws, including some intense cheerleading for federal hate crime legislation. Generally speaking, hate crime laws get into the realm of Orwellian thought crimes, where someone’s personal opinions are used to make an existing crime even more illegal. You’d think that an organization claiming to protect civil liberties would be against this kind of thing, but you’d be wrong… The ACLU’s selective support for hate crime laws once again shows what a bulls**t organization they are.

These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, and children...  Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. First developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis.

After extensive review of the 'training' issue, the OIG concludes that the matter does not lie in the caliber or technological experience of the poll worker, but is grounded in the absence of quality training sessions and written training materials. The fact that the County's full shipment of iVotronic machines did not arrive until July is also no excuse for the lack of planning that should have taken place with respect to a training curriculum. Basic training could have taken place with the initial shipment of devices. Obviously, the absence of a quality-training plan affects the successful implementation of any such endeavor."""

These uncertainties are reflected in divergent predictions of climate change made by computer models… But when the dust settles, what we are left with is the evidence. And, in spite of all its complexity and uncertainties, we should not lose track of the simple fact that theory, actual observations of the planet, and complex models – however imperfect each is in isolation – all point to ongoing, potentially dangerous human alteration of climate.”

01	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""[I]n three of the five states above [Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas], incarceration rates for murder and manslaughter were far higher for illegal aliens than for legal residents. Incarceration rates for murder are an imperfect proxy for rates of murders committed (illegal aliens may be more likely to be apprehended, have less competent counsel, etc.), but it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens are more law-abiding than legal residents — at least when it comes to major crimes. And it's even more difficult to contend that Americans' concern about crimes committed by illegal aliens is overblown.   Regardless, comparative crime rates are less important than the absolute number of crimes committed by illegal aliens. Look at California, where approximately 2,430 illegal aliens are in prison just for homicide-related offenses. Even if one assumes that each illegal alien so imprisoned was responsible for just one homicide-related offense, that amounts to about a couple thousand major crimes that, arguably, wouldn't have occurred but for the actors’ unlawful presence in the United States. That translates to thousands of American citizens (and others) across the country slaughtered by individuals who shouldn’t have been here in the first place."""

Now we remember that it was Bill Clinton’s administration that deregulated derivatives, that deregulated telecom, and that put our country’s only strong banking laws in the grave. He’s the one who rammed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through Congress and who taught the world that the way you respond to a recession is by paying off the federal deficit. Mass incarceration and the repeal of welfare, two of Clinton’s other major achievements, are the pillars of the disciplinary state that has made life so miserable for Americans in the lower reaches of society. He would have put a huge dent in Social Security, too, had the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal not stopped him.

[45] The National Women’s Law Center estimates that 62.8 million women have birth control coverage with no out-of-pocket cost. [46] Stuart O. Schweitzer, PhD, UCLA Professor of Health Policy and Management, stated that OTC is “more expensive to consumers than a prescribed drug that’s covered by insurance.” [47] Before Plan B emergency contraception went OTC, the drug cost about $12 for the brand name and $5 for the generic for women using Medicaid. After the drug became OTC, the cost increased to $50 for the brand name and $41 for the generic.

According to the 2015 Social Security Trustees' report, the trust funds will run out of money by 2034.

10	Sanctuary Cities: Top 3 Pros and Cons	Sanctuary policies prevent local and state police officers from doing their jobs. Sanctuary policies prevent police from investigating, questioning, and arresting people who have broken federal immigration law. Many crimes, violent and otherwise, could be prevented if local law enforcement in sanctuary cities could arrest undocumented immigrants for their first crime on US soil—illegal entry into the country—and turn them over to federal law enforcement. [14] According to Heather Mac Donald, JD, Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, many Salvadorian gang members living in Los Angeles entered the United States illegally, but because of sanctuary policies, LA police officers cannot arrest the undocumented immigrants for illegal entry. Instead, law enforcement has to wait for a second crime to be committed to get the criminals off the street. [14]

"""The ideas that 'letting nature take its course' is inherently different from causing death and that a physician's abating life-sustaining treatment [passive euthanasia] at patient request is inherently different from physician-assisted suicide are philosophically untenable. One way to cause death is to 'let' nature take its course. One way for physicians to assist suicide, while remaining within their professional capacities, is for them to write orders that withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment at patient request. The latter claim implies only that it is possible for physicians to assist suicide by acting within their well-recognized authority to abate life-sustaining treatment at patient request. It does not imply that their abating life-sustaining treatment at patient request amounts to, constitutes, is equivalent to assisted suicide. To refute my modest claim, one would have to prove that it is not possible for physicians to assist suicide in this way.

It violates the right to liberty and security, and the prohibition of slavery, of forced labor and of trafficking in persons because millions of women and girls all over the world are held in sexual slavery to meet the demand of even more millions of male buyers of sex, and to generate profits for the capitalists of sex.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""The intentional killing of another person is wrong and as Governor, I will not oversee the execution of any individual. Our death penalty system has been, by all measures, a failure. It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown, or can't afford expensive legal representation.

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“[E]arly, and effectively irreversible, decisions about teacher tenure have real costs for students and ultimately all of society. Teacher tenure, and the related onerous and costly requirements for dismissing an ineffective teacher, have evolved into a system that almost completely insulates teachers from review, evaluation, or personnel decisions that would threaten their lifetime employment. Research shows that this results in serious harm both to individual students and to society, because a small number of grossly ineffective teachers are retained in our schools.”
01	Could Electronic Voting Machine Software Be Programmed to Alter the Outcome of an Election?	"""DRE software, and the associated development and distribution processes, should be designed so that attacks are virtually impossible; but sadly, they are not...  Almost certainly 1% or 2%, or in some cases more, of all votes cast nationally on a particular vendor's equipment could be switched without detection, changing the outcome of many races across the country, including even the presidency in a close election such as we had in 1960 or 2000. There seems to unwarranted presupposition that the goal of an attack would be to rig the outcome of some particular election. A much more powerful attack, and one more suited to the vulnerabilities in DRE technology, would be to change the outcome of a large fraction of all very close elections in the nation, without targeting any particular one...  Contrary to intuition of people not skilled in security analysis, making the software ignore the pre-election test or tests and only initiate itself on election day is easy to do...The only kind of pre- or post-election test that would have any hope of detecting a well-designed fraud embedded in DRE code would be a test that looked exactly like a real election to the software, i.e. a test that takes about 13 hours and has the right kind of vote timing and frequency of human errors, the right range and distribution of votes, and had all the other details exactly right. Even with such a carefully-designed test, fraud still might not be detected because cheating could be randomized so that it is not repeatable, and is therefore difficult to distinguish from a timing bug or operator error...  The easiest mode of attack is to tamper with the software while it is in development, or during upgrades, bug fixes, or other software modifications, so that the tainted code is loaded onto the chips through the regular distribution channels. With that kind of attack, one never has to go near the voting machines, or ever set foot in the counties that use them, in order to swing elections."""

10	Does the Death Penalty Cost Less Than Life in Prison without Parole?

If the costs of the death penalty were to be measured at the time of an execution, that might indeed be true. But as every prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge knows, the costs of a capital case begin long before the sentence is carried out. Experienced prosecutors and defense attorneys must be assigned and begin a long period of investigation and pre-trial hearings. Jury selection, the trial itself, and initial appeals will consume years of time and enormous amounts of money before an execution is on the horizon…  [A]ll of the studies conclude that the death penalty system is far more expensive than an alternative system in which the maximum sentence is life in prison."""

If companies cannot afford to pay a higher minimum wage for low-skilled service employees, they will use automation to avoid hiring people in those positions altogether. Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey, PhD, and Michael A. Osborne, DPhil, stated in a 2013 study that ""robots are already performing many simple service tasks such as vacuuming, mopping, lawn mowing, and gutter cleaning"" and that ""commercial service robots are now able to perform more complex tasks in food preparation, health care, commercial cleaning, and elderly care.""

This debate also needs to recognize practical considerations including significant costs, paper jams and malfunctioning printers, voter delays, difficulty for poll workers, and meaningless receipts.

There was a time when it was considered very desirable, but research has forced us to rethink this recommendation... Dairy products contribute to a surprising number of health problems. They can impair a child's ability to absorb iron and in very small children can even cause subtle blood loss from the digestive tract. Combined with the fact that milk has virtually no iron of its own, the result is an increased risk of iron deficiency...  Cow's milk proteins are a common cause of colic, and now the American Academy of Pediatrics has concluded that there is evidence that cow's milk may well contribute to childhood-onset diabetes.

10	Is Solar Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""Government-backed solar boondoggles are rampant and include such devastating examples as the Solyndra loan, which cost taxpayers $535 million and left 1,100 employees without a job, and the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California, which, despite reaping $1.6 billion in subsidies, produces electricity at a cost three times higher than traditional power and has requested $539 million in additional direct handouts from the federal government...   In spite of government's best efforts to encourage innovation by solar energy companies and encourage Americans to rely more heavily on solar electricity, solar power continues to be a losing proposition. American taxpayers spent an average of $39 billion a year over the past 5 years financing grants, subsidizing tax credits, guaranteeing loans, bailing out failed solar energy boondoggles and otherwise underwriting every idea under the sun to make solar energy cheaper and more popular. But none of it has worked. Solar energy remains prohibitively expensive – often three times more than electricity produced from natural gas or other sources.

In 1980, the short and empirical answer to this question was yes. In 1990, because of improved efficiencies by both farmer and ethanol manufacturer, the answer was, probably not. In 2005 the answer is clearly no...  Several ethanol facilities are today beginning to use wood waste or, in the near future, corn stover, to replace natural gas to meet their thermal energy needs.

The remaining women spoke in more complex terms about subtle changes and reassessments in other-sex and same-sex feelings and behaviors, and many expressed concern that their personal transformations might be misinterpreted as ‘proof’ that most self-identified lesbian/gay/bisexual youth are just confused about their sexuality… The fact that all of the women in the relinquish group… continued to experience same-sex attractions… suggests that same-sex desires are far less amenable to (conscious or unconscious) change than are behavior and identity.

10	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“In the American imagination, the embargo serves mostly to deny us access to Cohibas and Havana Club rum, but its damage to the Cuban people has been, and continues to be, pervasive and profound. It affects their access to everything from electricity to video games to shoes. It has prevented Cubans from buying medical supplies from American companies, from buying pesticides and fertilizer, from purchasing Microsoft Word or downloading Adobe Acrobat. It has restricted how much money Cuban Americans can send to their families on the island… ‘This is a new day — es un nuevo día — between our two countries,’ President Obama announced in March to journalists assembled at the Plaza de la Revolución. But for all the improvements in U.S.–Cuban relations over the past two years, that new day will not really come until the embargo is lifted in its entirety. Certainly the embargo has left deep scars. It has continued for more than half a century, doing its worst damage at times when Cubans were at their most vulnerable, with aggressive enforcement that in critical ways continues to this day.”

The religious factions will go on imposing their will on others unless the decent people connected to them recognize that religion has no place in public policy. They must learn to make their views known without trying to make their views the only alternatives...

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“[E]liminating tenure will do little to address the real barriers to effective teaching in impoverished schools, and may even make them worse… First, firing bad teachers actually makes it harder to recruit new good ones, since new teachers don’t know which type they will be. That risk must be offset with higher salaries — but that in turn could force increases in class size that themselves harm student achievement. Second, while it might seem better to wait on granting tenure, early decisions — not in the first year, but soon after — actually improve student achievement. That’s partly because stable faculties are better for students, but also because an attentive district knows a great deal about which teachers are good and bad after just two years, and waiting longer provides little additional information. Finally, the freedom to fire experienced teachers is valuable only when dismissal rates are very high, say, 40 percent or more. And yet such rates come with costs: The risk of firing good teachers is high, and the impact on a school’s culture is detrimental to learning. In short, while the notion of ‘clearing the stables’ of bad teachers seems attractive, it is almost impossible to get right in practice. No conceivable system can eliminate all ‘grossly ineffective’ teachers, and efforts aimed at doing so can do more harm than good.”

E-cigarettes don't have those gases or tar.

10	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“The events of the Clinton presidency contributed to many of the international problems we now face… When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, most people probably would have assumed that his impeachment would be the most enduring black mark he left on history. Yet… with the events of September 11 it became clear that the Clinton administration’s most damaging legacy had nothing to do with his personal moral recklessness. It concerned his utter failure to safeguard the national interests of the United States by refusing to confront evil with strength and resolve. Today, Bill Clinton may pine over his lost ‘opportunity’ to shine in foreign policy. But he conveniently overlooks the many chances he had to engage the terrorists. If Clinton had had the courage to recognize and act upon them, he could have seized any number of legitimate opportunities to commence the war on terrorism that America was destined to face.”

Once a handful of plants have been successfully built, Wall Street will have the confidence necessary to be more forthcoming with financing.  The good news is that we are already well on our way to ensuring nuclear energy has a beneficial and growing role to play in meeting our nation's energy needs...I am confident that this industry, once it has revitalized, will financially sustain itself.

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""One cannot support the reduction of AIDS infections and support legal prostitution at the same time. Prostitution remains one of the leading vectors for AIDS infection. This is true in the case of both legal and illegal prostitution...   Prostitutes, because of their many partners, have a greatly increased risk of exposure to HIV. They are likewise able to spread HIV to many other partners...  The redefinition of prostitution as 'commercial sex work' is just an attempt to legitimize sex trafficking. It should come as no surprise the ACLU and Planned Parenthood have signed on. While both groups are considered 'pro-woman', it is odd that they support an industry of flagrant abuse of women...  There are a multitude of studies to show the high level of abuse that prostitutes suffer. Women are literally bought and sold as property. The incidence of drug addiction is high among women, partially explaining why they became prostitutes to begin with.  The argument for legalization goes something like this. Prostitution will happen anyway but legalization and regulation will help stem the abuses. The argument has 50,000 foot appeal. Using the same logic, slavery (which still exists in many places) should be legalized so underground slaves can be given some measure of human rights. The fact that the ACLU and the bevy of left-wing international groups don't argue for the legalization of slavery shows the logical inconsistency of their position.  Further, the legalization of abortion has shown that it lead to a radical increase in abortion. The legalization will lead to an untold number of women being forced into sex slavery. Make no mistake, women will be forced into commercial sex work in greater numbers if it were legalized."""

"""Although it is frequently argued that suicide assistance and active euthanasia are morally equivalent, the law in all states draws a clear distinction between these two types of acts. In New York, assisting a suicide, except in certain limited circumstances, is a form of second-degree manslaughter. Euthanasia, however, falls under the definition of second-degree murder, as the defendant intentionally causes the death of the victim through his or her direct acts. Because the consent of the victim is not a defense to murder, euthanasia is therefore prosecutable as murder in the second degree. """
01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“Social Security will be strengthened if modernized to include a system of voluntary personal accounts. Retirement security will be increased through personal accounts because they would facilitate wealth creation for individual participants. Strengthening Social Security to include personal accounts can add valuable protections for widows, divorced persons, low-income households and other Americans at risk of poverty in old age. Personal accounts would permit individuals to seek a higher rate of return on their Social Security contributions, offering higher total expected benefits to individuals with accounts than those lacking them. Partial advance funding of Social Security should be a goal of any effort to strengthen the system. Advance funding within Social Security can best be accomplished through personal accounts rather than direct government investment.

More to the point, are these questions that we want our government asking?… For every house of worship that is exempt from property taxes, taxpayers have to pay more than they would have if a residence or business were on that same piece of land. Do churches not benefit from the same taxpayer-funded benefits that the rest of us enjoy — protection by the police and fire departments, maintenance of roads to and from their places of worship, etc? Why then should they be exempt from these taxes?”
10	Does insider trading contribute to market efficiency?	"""...[I]nsider trading affects stock market prices through what is known as 'derivatively informed trading.' First, those individuals possessing material nonpublic information begin trading. Their trading has only a small effect on price. Some uninformed traders become aware of the insider trading through leakage or tipping of information or through observation of insider trades. Other traders gain insight by following the price fluctuations of the securities. Finally, the market reacts to the insiders' trades and gradually moves toward the correct price. But while derivatively informed trading can affect price, it functions slowly and sporadically. Given the inefficiency of derivatively informed trading, the market efficiency justification for insider trading loses much of its force..."""
01	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“Bill [Clinton] is an extraordinary mixture of easygoing charm and ferocious intellectual capacity. Probably, in terms of political intuition and certainly in terms of turning such intuition into analysis, he is the most formidable politician I ever met. My theory is that, in a curious way, the blessing of his times is the disadvantage of his legacy. As with any period, the years 1993-2000 were full of events, many of them significant. But the world-changing events – 9/11 and the financial crisis – happened in the next presidency. Bill was actually a brilliant president. He made it at times look easy. He ran a good economy; made big reforms; handled… Kosovo with real leadership.”
10	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“As a senior scientist with the National Toxicology Program [NTP], I was one of 22 experts who participated in that IARC evaluation five years ago. At that time we classified cellphone radiation as possibly carcinogenic to humans based on positive associations that had been observed between cellphone radiation and malignant brain tumors and tumors of Schwann cells that surround the auditory nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain (acoustic neuroma)… More recent evidence on health effects of cellphone radiation has strengthened the case for concluding that this radiation poses a cancer risk. The U.S. National Toxicology Program recently reported results from a study in which rats and mice were exposed to cellphone RFR for two years at exposure intensities in the range of cellphone emissions and that did not cause measurable increases in body temperature… The findings of highly malignant and quite rare brain tumors and malignant Schwann cell tumors of the heart in the NTP study present a major public health concern because some of these same types of tumors had been reported in epidemiological studies of adult cellphone users. In addition the NTP reported DNA damage was induced in brain cells of exposed animals.”

Why on God’s earth would I need a computer to connect with the people around me? Why should my relationships be mediated through the imagination of a bunch of supergeeks in California? What was wrong with the pub? And does Facebook really connect people? Doesn’t it rather disconnect us, since instead of doing something enjoyable such as talking and eating and dancing and drinking with my friends, I am merely sending them little ungrammatical notes and amusing photos in cyberspace, while chained to my desk?… Clearly, Facebook is another uber-capitalist experiment: can you make money out of friendship? Can you create communities free of national boundaries — and then sell Coca-Cola to them? Facebook is profoundly uncreative. It makes nothing at all. It simply mediates in relationships that were happening anyway.”
10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""In 1990, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I wrote the Anabolic Steroids Control Act, which added 'anabolic steroids' to Schedule Three of the Controlled Substances Act and began to list a host of substances falling within that definition. In 2004, I proposed legislation to update that law and added the substances 'THG' and 'Andro,' and their chemical cousins, to the list of anabolic steroids.  The reasons for these changes were simple: these substances not only pose great health risks, but they threaten the fundamental integrity of sport and send the wrong message to our kids – that cheating to get ahead is acceptable, no matter the cost.  So I worked hard to ban these substances, educate our youth and professional athletes, and reduce this wrongful behavior in American sports."""

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Older generations often unfairly disparage new things that youth like, such as video games. The ""moral panic"" that many adults feel about video games is an exaggerated sense of public concern, fear, and anxiety over a perceived threat of social corruption. [113] Other examples of moral panic from history include rock and roll, comic books, radio, television, cell phone use, and social media. [114] An Oct. 2013 study in Psychology of Popular Media Culture found that people who had no experience playing video games were six times more likely to believe the games contributed to mass shootings. Older Americans were five times more likely than young people to think that the games caused mass shootings. [116] The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooter, for example, was originally and incorrectly reported to be an avid player of violent video games. Investigators later showed that the shooter's favorite games were Super Mario Brothers, Dance, Dance Revolution, and other non-violent video games. [115] Read More"
01	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Depression, Bipolar Disorders, Anxiety, and Similar Mood Disorders?	patients report significant improvement and stabilization with their bipolar disorder when they utilize adjunctive therapy with medical cannabis. While some mental health professionals worry about the impact of cannabis on aggravating manic states, most bipolar patients trying cannabis find they ‘cycle’ less often and find significant improvement in overall mood. Bipolar disorders vary tremendously in the time spent in the depressive versus manic states. Those who experience extended depressive episodes are more likely to be helped with cannabis. Patients who use cannabis to ‘relax’ may be treating the anxiousness sometimes associated with depression. Cannabis aids the insomnia sometimes present in depression and can improve appetite. Better pain control with cannabis can reduce chronic pain related depression. While cannabis cannot yet be considered a primary treatment of major depression it may improve mood when used under physicians supervision and in combination with therapy and/or SSRI’s.”

Operation is also cheap, compared with nukes, which run on expensive uranium and must be monitored minute by minute so they don't melt down...the price of new nuclear power has risen faster than any other form of power, as a detailed study of coal, gas, wind and nuclear power capital costs by Cambridge Energy Research Associates concluded.  In fact, from 2000 through October 2007, nuclear power plant construction costs - mainly materials, labor and engineering - have gone up 185 percent! That means a nuclear power plant that would have cost $4 billion to build in 2000 would have cost more than $11 billion to build last October...  So much for being a near-term, cost-effective solution."""

As our results show, the inclusion of these young people has contributed to more prosperous local, state and national economies; to safer and stronger communities through increased access to cars and home ownership; and to a more prepared and educated workforce for the future. Ending DACA now would be counterproductive at best and, at worst, cruel. At present, 800,000 lives—as well as the lives of their families and friends—hang in the balance."""

In civilized society, we reject the principle of literally doing to criminals what they do to their victims: The penalty for rape cannot be rape, or for arson, the burning down of the arsonist's house. We should not, therefore, punish the murderer with death... Capital punishment is a barbaric remnant of uncivilized society."""
10	Do Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide Violate the Hippocratic Oath?	"""Because the Hippocratic Oath instructs physicians not to provide a 'deadly drug,' some have concluded that physicians, by their training and moral commitment, must necessarily reject assistance in hastening death. This is not so. The provision in the Hippocratic Oath that prohibits providing a deadly drug did not even reflect accepted medical practice in ancient Greek city-states where, upon request, a physician could provide a lethal drug for a suffering patient. In some sense, physicians who provide assistance in hastening death are adhering to a longstanding understanding of the scope of medical practice: to care for and meet the needs and desires of a patient in all stages of the patient’s life. Significantly, the activities a physician undertakes in providing assistance in hastening death are the same as those often carried out by a physician who oversees a withdrawal of treatment. As a purely medical matter, there is little to distinguish a physician’s activities in withdrawing treatment from activities in hastening death through other means."""

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“School boards operate in a completely different environment today than they did when tenure was established in 1909. Over a century of statutes, regulations and court decisions protect employees from arbitrary dismissal and discrimination. More recently, the School Ethics Act and the School District Accountability Act and regulations added to safeguards against patronage hiring and nepotism. New Jersey’s tenure system has devolved into a lifetime job protection for teachers, regardless of how well they perform in the classroom. The New Jersey School Boards Association believes that our state’s children deserve a public school system that places educational quality above employee job security. Therefore, reforming the current system of lifetime tenure should be at the heart of educational improvement and reform. NJSBA supports replacement of lifetime tenure for school employees with a system of renewable employment contracts.”
10	Is it legal for Congressional representatives to trade securities based on insider information?	"""While trading by Members of Congress or their staff is not exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions, there are distinct legal and factual issues that may arise in any investigations or prosecutions of such cases. Any statutory changes in this area should be carefully calibrated to ensure that they do not narrow current law and thereby make it more difficult to bring future insider trading actions against individuals outside of Congress.”"
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“I [recall] times as a teacher when I thought my students learned the most. It wasn’t when we were intensely preparing for the Regents exams or any other standardized tests. My students were most engaged during project-based learning, when they worked in teams and wrestled with complex topics, such as the decision to drop the atomic bomb during World War II… Those are the kinds of educational experiences that excite students and teachers alike. Teachers don’t want to spend valuable time endlessly preparing for ‘the test.’ They want to guide their students to ask insightful questions, offer well-reasoned opinions, and work diligently until they master content. Those are the types of classroom experiences that unleash students’ ingenuity and reveal their understanding of the material. And that’s the kind of learning that is being stamped out by the current pervasive fixation on testing.”

This would not be visiting the sins of the parents on the children, as is often claimed, since the children of illegal aliens born in the U.S. would not be denied anything to which they otherwise would have a right. Their allegiance should follow that of their parents during their minority. A nation that cannot determine who becomes citizens or believes that it must allow the children of those who defy its laws to become citizens is no longer a sovereign nation. No one is advocating that those who have been granted birthright citizenship be stripped of their citizenship. Equal protection considerations would counsel that citizenship once granted is vested and cannot be revoked; this, I believe, is eminently just."""
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""We are gravely concerned that a one-state 'solution' would both mean the end of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state and create the circumstances for a human rights catastrophe. Despite claims to the contrary, the creation of a binational state would be both radical and antithetical to genuine peace.   The one-state idea marks a departure from the well-established premise of 'two states for two peoples,' a solution supported by a strong majority of both Israelis and Palestinians. Support for a binational state ignores the undeniable fact that Israeli and Palestinian societies are drastically different in terms of economic development, political orientation, and cultural identity—a situation which would not change with the removal of a political border. Given the two sides' history of mutual hostility and resentment, the creation of a single state will likely lead to violent ethnic conflict, a result desired by none but the most radical elements in the region. As a result, a majority of experts across the political spectrum agree that despite difficulties in reaching an agreement, a two-state solution is far preferable to a one-state non-solution."""

For example, software code passes through numerous internal and external checks before use in an actual election, including rigorous certification testing by independent certification bodies. Voting system software is engineered months in advance of actual elections, making it very unlikely for programmers to know who candidates will be and impossible to know how their names will appear on ballots.

The Pledge Protection Act will help restore the system of checks and balances intended by our Founding Fathers.

The fact that various aspects of sex work are treated as criminal conduct in many countries means that sex workers cannot rely on support or protection from the police. For many sex workers, reporting crimes experienced during the course of their work means putting themselves at risk of criminalization and/or penalization on the basis of their involvement in sex work, seizure of their earnings, potential loss of their livelihood through related sanctions and/or monitoring by the police to detect their clients. As a result, sex workers are frequently unable to seek redress for crimes committed against them, thereby offering impunity to perpetrators. In addition, the stigmatized and criminalized status that sex workers experience gives law enforcement officials in many countries the scope to harass, extort and perpetrate physical and sexual violence against them, also with impunity. When they are not threatened with criminalization/penalization, sex workers are better able to collaborate with law enforcement to identify perpetrators of violence and abuse, including human trafficking."""

Young peoples’ drinking is moving to the extremes: between 1993 and 2001, 18-20 year-olds showed the largest increase in binge drinking episodes. This trend should serve as a call to action for parents, educators, and lawmakers, for while moderate consumption represents little harm to young people and may even be psychologically beneficial, excessive and abusive consumption-binge drinking-spells disastrous consequences for our nation’s youth.”

They falsely equate Western European-style socialism, and its government provision of social insurance and health care, with Marxist-Leninist totalitarianism. It offends me, and cheapens the experience of millions who lived, and continue to live, under brutal forms of socialism...  Whatever his faults, I don't see much of a socialist in Mr. Obama or, thankfully, signs of that system in this great nation."""

10	Should Marijuana Be Reclassified as a Schedule II or III Drug?	is listed in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the most restrictive schedule. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the CSA, continues to support that placement and FDA concurred because marijuana met the three criteria for placement in Schedule I under 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1) (e.g., marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision). Furthermore, there is currently sound evidence that smoked marijuana is harmful. A past evaluation by several Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA), concluded that no sound scientific studies supported medical use of marijuana for treatment in the United States, and no animal or human data supported the safety or efficacy of marijuana for general medical use.”
01	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Obamacare means a huge improvement in the quality of life for tens of millions of Americans – not just better care, but greater financial security. And even those who were already insured have gained both security and freedom, because they now have a guarantee of coverage if they lose or change jobs.  What about the costs? Here, too, the news is better than anyone expected. In 2014, premiums on the insurance policies offered through the Obamacare exchanges were well below those originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, and the available data indicates a mix of modest increases and actual reductions for 2015 – which is very good in a sector where premiums normally increase five percent or more each year. More broadly, overall health spending has slowed substantially, with the cost-control features of the ACA probably deserving some of the credit.  In other words, health reform is looking like a major policy success story. It's a program that is coming in ahead of schedule – and below budget – costing less, and doing more to reduce overall health costs than even its supporters predicted…  And this big improvement in American society is almost surely here to stay… Health reform has made America a different, better place."""

01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity. Therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency -- unless that electricity is used to substitute for oil in our transportation system...   Converting our electric system fully to renewables would require us to shut down about 80 percent of our current electricity-generating capacity, much of it low-cost, already paid off and capable of generating electricity for another 25 years or more. Moreover, to reach very high penetration rates of renewable electricity would require that we overcome the principal shortcoming of wind and sunlight: intermittency.  Powering 100 percent of our transportation system would require about 30 percent of the electricity generated in 2006. With a massive effort, using a combination of solar and wind power, we could generate about that much electricity by 2020."""

10	Are DACA and the DREAM Act Good for America?	"""Based on the facts – rather than the myth – it seems pretty clear that the individuals who applied for, and received, DACA were not the oppressed, well-meaning, high-achievers that the media and the open-borders lobby portrayed them to be.   The DACA program was illegal. But it was also bad from a long-term policy perspective. Rewarding people who violate our laws only encourages more people to become lawbreakers. Accordingly, President Trump's decision to cancel the program is a welcome one.   However, that decision does not appear to herald a return to the rule-of-law. The first response from legislators – on both sides of the aisle – was a call amnesty [sic]. Members of the House and Senate have repeatedly asked, 'Would it be fair to deport the DACA 'kids'?' But that’s the wrong question. The one our representatives should be asking is: 'Is it in the national security, public safety and economic interests of the United States to reward 800,000 immigration law violators?' The answer to that question is, 'No' – especially when one realizes that much of the DACA narrative is utterly false.  And the low standards for the DACA program should have every American wondering just exactly who will be given amnesty if the more expansive DREAM Act, or similar legislation, should pass. If history is a guide, expansive amnesty programs are the last thing that will make America great again."""

10	Does the ACLU Fail to Protect the First Amendment Rights of Abortion Clinic Protesters?

In an environment where teens spend around nine hours using some form of online media every day, it doesn’t take long for them to be influenced by an ‘all-about-the-likes’ sense of values that can potentially lead to life-altering decisions… The combination of social media pressure and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that helps us rationalize decisions, control impulsivity and make judgments, can contribute to offensive online posts.”

01	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Hunger, said Amartya Sen, results not from scarcity, but poverty. According to the FAO, there is enough food in the world to supply everyone with a daily 3,500-calorie diet of fresh fruit, nuts, vegetables, dairy and meat. Nonetheless, because they are poor, 824 million people continue to go hungry. In 2000, world leaders promised to halve the proportion of hungry people living in extreme poverty by 2015. Little progress has been made. The world's poorest people already spend 50-80% of their total household income on food...  With every one percent rise in the cost of food, 16 million people are made food insecure. If current trends continue, some 1.2 billion people could be chronically hungry by 2025—600 million more than previously predicted. World food aid will not likely come to the rescue because surpluses will go into our gas tanks. What are urgently needed are massive transfers of food-producing resources to the rural poor; not converting land to fuel production...  Government-subsidies and mandated targets for agro-fuels [industrial scale biofuels] are the perfect answer to this slump in agribusiness profits, growing as oil shrinks, and concentrating market power in the hands of the most powerful players in the food and fuel industries. Like the original Agrarian Transition, the Corporate Agro-fuels Transition will 'enclose the commons' by industrializing the remaining forests and prairies of the world. It will drive the planet's remaining smallholders, family farmers, and indigenous peoples to the cities. This government-industry collusion has the potential to funnel rural resources to urban centers in the form of fuel, concentrating industrial wealth.

10	Did Obamacare Contain Provisions to Reduce Health Care Fraud? – YES	[Editor's Note: Based upon a neutral reading of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and bi-partisan third party analysis, this question seems to have a clear and obvious Pro (yes) answer, and ProCon.org has therefore presented the responses in a single column with no opposing perspective.]
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010 as the signature domestic achievement of the Obama presidency. It was intended to contain costs and achieve near-universal access to affordable health care of improved quality. Now, five years later, it is time to assess its track record… Based on the evidence, one has to conclude that containment of health care costs is nowhere in sight, that more than 37 million Americans will still be uninsured when the ACA is fully implemented in 2019, that many more millions will be underinsured, and that profiteering will still dominate the culture of U.S. health care…  The ACA built upon the flaws of our market-based system and, quite predictably, is failing to contain costs and provide broad access to affordable, quality health care. Corporate interests still trump the common good in U.S. health care. More fundamental reform is required based upon universal access to health care as a right… Until that happens, we can expect continued turmoil and increasing public backlash to a dysfunctional system that places profits over service. It is just a matter of time before the country will be forced to choose between discredited, deregulated markets and a more efficient single-payer system that ensures access to essential health care for all Americans."""

The siege must end. The occupation must end. The violence must end. The rejection of elementary legal and moral principles must end. Only a just solution can bring a permanent peace, and there is today only but one just solution.   The Arabs proposed it before Israel existed, only to have it rejected by the Zionists and their Western benefactors–a single, united, democratic state with a constitution and representative government that recognizes the equal rights of all and protects the rights of the minority.

"""Voluntary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by public school students is a patriotic exercise that acknowledges the religious principles upon which this country was founded. Inclusion of the phrase 'under God' in the Pledge, simply recognizes the historical fact that our founders declared independence and established this nation based on principles that transcend man made laws. The Pledge is not a prayer or any other type of religious exercise.

That shorthand term for 'illegal immigrants' - which they use as a noun, making linguists cringe - is being used repeatedly by reactionary commentators and politicians in every venue available. They rail about 'illegals' on radio talk shows. Hate groups like the Aryan Nation spew vitriol about the 'illegal invasion' in e-mail blasts. Bill O'Reilly and Lou Dobbs drone on about 'illegals' every night. These distinct groups use the same language. The same words. The same phrases. It's an orchestrated effort designed to instill fear in Americans. And it's working.  Throw in other scary words, such as 'invasion' and 'alien,' and it's bound to make people feel scared.

10	Has Obamacare Worsened the Primary Care Physician Shortage? - DEBATED	"""Although the committee was not charged with projecting the future demand for physicians, it reviewed recent projections and analyses of the capacity of the physician workforce to meet the nation's health needs. Some projections suggest imminent physician shortages that could prevent many people from getting needed health services. These analyses raise concerns that the rapid aging of the population and the expansion in health coverage resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will fuel demand for physician services far beyond the current capacity. However, the underlying methodologies and assumptions about the future in these studies are problematic. They generally assume historical provider–patient ratios using existing technological supports and thus have limited relevance to future health care delivery systems or to the need for a more coordinated, affordable, and patient-centered health care system...  Physician workforce analyses that consider the potential impact of changes and improvements in health care delivery draw different conclusions. These studies suggest that an expanded primary care role for physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses, redesign of care delivery, and the use of other innovations, such as telehealth and electronic communication, may ultimately lessen the demand for physicians despite the added pressures of the aging population and coverage expansions."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“I am going to speak today about the most media-hyped environmental issue of all time, global warming… The media have missed the big pieces of the puzzle when it comes to the Earth’s temperatures and mankind’s carbon dioxide (C02) emissions. It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the one degree Fahrenheit temperature increase during the 20th century means we are all doomed. First of all, the one degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the greatest advancement of living standards, life expectancy, food production and human health in the history of our planet. So it is hard to argue that the global warming we experienced in the 20th century was somehow negative or part of a catastrophic trend. Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have continued to ignore is the fact that the Little Ice Age, which resulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold deaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today’s temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend. In addition, something that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the theory that C02 has been the driving force in global warming. Alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began warming at the end of the Little Ice Age in about 1850, long before man-made CO2 emissions could have impacted the climate. Then about 1940, just as man-made CO2 emissions rose sharply, the temperatures began a decline that lasted until the 1970’s, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice age. Let me repeat, temperatures got colder after C02 emissions exploded. If C02 is the driving force of global climate change, why do so many in the media ignore the many skeptical scientists who cite these rather obvious inconvenient truths?”
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“Clamors for the embargo’s lifting persist despite the fulfillment of dissident and exile warnings that diplomatic recognition of the Castro regime would strengthen the oppressors and crush popular dissent. The removal of what little trade sanctions remain is legally and morally unjustified… The oft-repeated rhetoric that the embargo has ‘exacerbated the hardships’ of the Cuban people is untrue. The Castros’ totalitarian system of governance, which has created economic, sociopolitical and spiritual impoverishment, is the veritable culprit, not the embargo. Fifty-five years of global trade with Cuba refutes allegations of enforced isolation.

"""The U.S.-Mexico border stands to become one of the world's most militarized borders, even though the two countries are not at war. Massive increases in appropriations for border security have served only to decrease real security in the U.S., disrupting the quality of life and economies of border communities and eroding human rights in the region. Since the 1993 establishment of border control policies, at least 7,000 immigrants have lost their lives crossing the border."""
10	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	“Clinton didn’t, as he now claims, lead us ‘to a new era of peace.’ He inherited a hard-won peace, failed to lead, and part of his legacy is 9/11. It was understandable (if unfortunate) that in 1992, after the end of the Cold War, the American people would think they could afford a president who would fatuously think it enough to claim to be ‘on the right side of history’ (whatever that means), rather than being willing to make tough decisions.”
01	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""When government acknowledges that it is 'under God,' it acknowledges that it is not the source of our rights and therefore cannot deny them to us. Our rights come from a source higher than and prior to the government - from the Creator himself. A government that declares this is humbler and safer than one that imagines itself to be the source of all our freedoms.  To edit 'under God' out of the Pledge of Allegiance, or the Creator from the Declaration of Independence, would change far more than the wording of two famous utterances. It would shift our entire understanding of where our rights come from...  The government can't and won't tell us who God is; that is in the domain of faith. But the government can and most certainly should affirm what is in the domain of reason - that there is a good and just God who endows the people with rights that the government must respect."""
01	Is Global Oil Production at (or past) Its Peak?	"""Our analysis of the discovery and production of oil fields around the world suggests that within the next decade, the supply of conventional oil will be unable to keep up with demand...  [C]onventional wisdom erroneously assumes that the last bucket of oil can be pumped from the ground just as quickly as the barrels of oil gushing from wells today. In fact, the rate at which any well - or any country - can produce oil always rises to a maximum and then, when about half the oil is gone, begins falling gradually back to zero...  From an economic perspective, when the world runs completely out of oil is thus not directly relevant: what matters is when production begins to taper off...  There is only so much crude oil in the world, and the industry has found about 90 percent of it...  Barring a global recession, it seems most likely that world production of conventional oil will peak during the first decade of the 21st century."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“Facts clearly demonstrate that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea. The case against raising the minimum wage is straightforward: A higher wage makes it more expensive for firms to hire workers. How big an effect does this have on the job market? Economists debate this. But no one argues that increasing the minimum wage increases the number of unemployed workers who find jobs. In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer… Why not support increasing the minimum wage? Because it will make it more expensive for businesses to hire young and low-skill workers at a time of crisis-level unemployment. Because it will not alleviate poverty. Because there are much better alternatives to help poor families, and because the minimum wage is a dishonest approach that hides the true cost of the policy.”
10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	use should not be legalized in any capacity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has NOT recognized or approved the use of marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication. Marijuana is still a Schedule I drug, and as such, is not able to be effectively researched for medicinal purposes. Ultimately, the legalization of marijuana will lower the perception of risk. A lower perception of harm or risk historically leads to an increased usage among youth… Every state that has now legalized marijuana for ‘recreational’ use started by legalizing marijuana for ‘medical’ use. This is a particularly slippery slope in a region and state already so overwhelmed by substance use and abuse.”

01	Are Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Cities, Counties, and States) Good Policy?	"""There is a reason more than 600 cities and counties across our country have some type of sanctuary policy: They work.   We're all better off when everyone, regardless of how they came to this country, is willing to report a crime, enroll their children in school and access vaccines.   There is no legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but generally, it refers to a city or county that chooses to focus its resources on local priorities. Immigration enforcement is the federal government's job. Public safety is local government's job... If someone is too afraid to report that they’ve been raped or robbed because they fear deportation, then a criminal goes free. Everyone is less safe. That’s what happens when President Trump tries to force local police to become deportation agents."""

What is the real number of actual innocents released from death row?  A review of the DPIC [Death Penalty Information Center] 102 case descriptions finds that only about 32 claim actual innocence, with alleged proof to support the claim. 12 of those 32 are DNA cases. That is 32 cases out of about 7,300 death sentences since 1973, or 0.4%...  And there is no proof of an innocent executed within the US since 1900.   Some supporters of a moratorium and death penalty opponents claim that a concern for innocents is why they want to halt executions. Yet, history and reason confirm that an end to executions will result in more innocents harmed and murdered...  At least 8% of those on death row had committed one or more murders prior to the murder(s) which put them on death row, suggesting that with 7,300 sentenced to death, since 1973, that those sent to death row had murdered at least 600 additional innocents after we failed to properly restrain them after their previous murder(s)...  It currently takes nearly 12 years to execute those sentenced to death. And some elected officials are debating a moratorium on executions.

10	"Do the Words ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Improperly Endorse Religion?"	"""Let me give you five reasons why the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional and should be affirmed by the Court as not violating the Establishment Clause.  The Pledge of Allegiance is not in a form of prayer.  The Pledge of Allegiance does not refer to Christianity or any other particular religion.  The religious portion of the Pledge of Allegiance is only two words.  The Pledge of Allegiance was recited unchanged for 50 years before the Court considered the question.  And no one can be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance...  I think that the words 'God save the United States and this Honorable Court,' like the words of the Pledge of Allegiance, echo what our founding fathers thought, and that was that our freedoms, rights and liberties are derived not from government but rather from God granting them to mankind. And in a sense, it's a very Lockean concept. Thomas Jefferson talks about it. And even, of course, in the Declaration of Independence itself...where it's written, 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. Amongst them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'...  Our country was founded on the concepts that the rights of man don't derive from a king and they can't be taken away from us by a king. The rights of mankind, the basic rights of mankind - liberty, freedom, the things that we cherish in this country - derive from a Creator. That's what our founding fathers mean...  It's [the phrase 'under God'] not a theological statement. It is a statement that reflects an historical fact. This is what our founding fathers believed, and so I don't think it presents either a constitutional crisis or a theological one."""
10	Is Large-Scale Wind Power Production Environmentally Friendly?	"""The universal rationale for the massive public commitment to wind power is that it is environmentally benign. But wind power has at least one major environmental problem -- the killing of bird populations -- that has begun to cause serious concern among mainstream environmentalist.  Wind blades have killed thousands of birds in the Unites States and abroad in the last decade, including endangered species, which is a federal offense subject to criminal prosecution...  A distinct air-emission problem of wind capacity is created when a new project is built where there is surplus electricity-generating capacity. Because wind farms require hundreds of tons of energy-intensive materials, virtually all of the air emissions associated with the gas or electricity used to make the materials (such as cement or steel) must be counted against the 'saved' air emissions once the farm comes online and displaces fossil-fuel-generated output...  [T]he air emissions associated with the construction of wind capacity that is not needed to meet either peak or baseload demand would be substantial enough to create an environmental externality [the application of economics to environmental issues such as the effects of an activity (ie. pollution) that are not taken into account when the activity is priced] from the viewpoint of its proponents.  Wind power's land disturbance, noise, and unsightly turbines also present environmental drawbacks."""
01	Does Clemency Serve as a Safeguard in Capital Punishment Cases?	"""The most obvious benefit of clemency is that it provides a 'fail-safe' to correct the mistakes of an imperfect justice system. Although today our legal systems are generally much more refined than the common law systems in which clemency originated, mistakes inevitably occur... In Illinois, executions were recently halted and Governor Ryan established a clemency commission to study the administration of the death penalty after it came to light that since 1990, that state has executed 11 inmates and freed 10 from Death Row... Clearly, as the federal system gears up to reinstate executions, and limits on appeals reduce the ability of judges to ameliorate punishment, there remains a need for clemency in cases of actual innocence, or where there are other questions about guilt."""

For DREs, the 2004 Positive Trust Score was 68%, the 2005 Positive Trust Score was 62%, and the 2006 Positive Trust Score is 68%...  'This year's results show a change back to a higher trust rating for the DREs, which is consistent with the results from 2004.

01	Should the United States Continue to Build a Fence or Wall along the US/Mexico Border?	"""[G]iven the growth in worldwide migration and the emergence of new threats along the southern border, it is essential that the fence be completed and supplemented by other security structures – including walls where appropriate.   To date, sixty-five other countries have built security fences and other barriers to protect themselves from large scale migration and the infiltration of terrorists. Fences do not guarantee security, but they are an integral tool for securing borders and send the message that would-be migrants are expected to enter the country through the proper channels...   Regardless of which approach is taken, securing the southern border is a sound fiscal investment. The overall construction and annual maintenance costs pale when compared to the $113 billion FAIR estimates illegal immigration costs American taxpayers. In fact, if the project only results in a 5 percent reduction in the annual cost of illegal immigration to American taxpayers, and construction and maintenance costs reach the most expensive estimates, it would pay for itself after only six years."""
01	Is the ACLU Good for America?	ACLU has been an essential champion of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, protecting the right of all Americans to freedom of religion and freedom from the state establishment of religion. As a journalist who has written about women’s reproductive health issues for many years, I have had a front row seat at how the ACLU has continually stepped up at pivotal points to protect a woman’s right to privacy, especially her right to control her own body and fertility, and to respond to the demands of her own conscience. With the pace of threats of women’s access to pregnancy termination and birth control services showing no signs of abating, the ACLU’s role in defending those rights is arguably more urgent than ever before.”

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?

Capital cases are given especially close scrutiny at every level, which is why in most cases many years elapse before the sentence is executed. And of course capital cases receive special attention in the application of executive clemency...  As a consequence of the sensitivity of the criminal justice system to the due-process rights of defendants sentenced to death, almost two-thirds of all death sentences are overturned....  [T]hose ideologically driven to ferret out and proclaim a mistaken modern execution have not a single verifiable case to point to, whereas it is easy as pie to identify plainly guilty murderers who have been set free.

10	Should States Issue Driver’s Licenses to Immigrants in the United States Illegally?	"""Many states are offering illegal immigrants a host of goodie bags brimming with benefits at the expense of the American taxpayer. These states are putting their security at risk and undermining federal efforts to control illegal immigration…   Unfortunately, many states have decided to go into the business of encouraging illegal immigration.   Some 605,000 of the roughly 1.4 million drivers’ licenses issued in California last year went to illegal immigrants.   Not only did the state allow aliens to obtain licenses — they actively encouraged it.   After the passage of Assembly Bill 60 on Jan. 2, 2015, the California Department of Motor Vehicles embarked on a widespread information campaign, holding 200 community outreach events at a variety of locations, issuing Spanish-language messages on social media and creating a new page on their website dedicated to the new law.   The cost of this outreach — coupled with the cost of processing the new applicants — is estimated at $141 million over three years. Of course, this cost will be borne by the legal citizens of California. While California clearly wants illegal immigrants to drive, it hasn’t yet made any efforts to require those immigrants to pay taxes."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“[I]t’s worth pausing and considering why political obsession with computerized teacher ratings based upon student [standardized test] scores is bad policy and bad for students… Issues influencing how children score on a single test on a single day are so complicated that undue and inflexible reliance upon growth scores does a real disservice to our children… The success of the opt-out movement in New York and elsewhere demonstrates that parents are realizing that increased reliance on testing for the purpose of rating and firing teachers is bad for children. Anxiety over testing is replacing love of learning. The opt-out movement is growing because the goal of good educational practices is being abandoned by politicians in favor of a witch hunt to find and fire allegedly bad teachers.”
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“The models the IPCC uses for projecting a 3 to 4 degree Celsius increase in temperature all assume large positive (that is, temperature-magnifying) feedbacks from a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere… If the climate system is less sensitive to greenhouse gases than the climate campaign believes, then what is causing plainly observable changes in the climate, such as earlier arriving springs, receding glaciers, and shrinking Arctic Ocean ice caps?… The IPCC downplays theories of variations in solar activity, such as sunspot activity and gamma ray bursts, and although there is robust scientific literature on the issue, even the skeptic community is divided about whether solar activity is a primary cause of recent climate variation. Several studies of Arctic warming conclude that changes in ocean currents, cloud formation, and wind patterns in the upper atmosphere may explain the retreat of glaciers and sea ice better than greenhouse gases… Above all, if the medieval warm period was indeed as warm or warmer than today, we cannot rule out the possibility that the changes of recent decades are part of a natural rebound from the ‘Little Ice Age’ that followed the medieval warm period and ended in the 19th century.”

10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	Lowering MLDA 21 would be medically irresponsible. Alcohol consumption can interfere with development of the young adult brain's frontal lobes, essential for functions such as emotional regulation, planning, and organization. When alcohol consumption interferes with this early adult brain development, the potential for chronic problems such as greater vulnerability to addiction, dangerous risk-taking behavior, reduced decision-making ability, memory loss, depression, violence, and suicide is greater.

"""The results from this study show that a county buying touchscreens will increase their annual expenditures by 57.3%. Owning optical scanners should increase their expected annual costs 16.9%.... One factor that may explain why having touchscreens costs so much more than optical scanners is because the county has to own and maintain so many more machines. We estimate that one optical scanner can handle six voter's votes a minute (or 360 per hour) as they are cast but because it takes a voter at least three minutes to vote with touchscreens it would take at least 18 touchscreens to perform per hour as well as optical scanners."""

01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""How interested are we in fairness in sport? Athletes try to enhance their performance in many ways: coaches, psychologists, dietitians, massage therapists, training at high altitude, skin-tight swimsuits. All of these are used to gain an advantage, which is often unfair because, like drugs, they are available to some – wealthy athletes rather than cheats – but not to everyone.   The Tour de France, a sporting event well known for drug use, would not suddenly become a level contest if drug use disappeared. The race winner has his performance enhanced by the quality of his team...  Given that drugs are significantly cheaper than psychologists, permitting their use might actually level out the playing field for poorer athletes. Finally, if fairness is our major concern we can easily solve the problem by lifting the prohibition – thus making drugs available to all athletes."""

In a survey of women seeking abortions, 72% said they were pregnant because they could not get the contraception they needed, and 32% reported an institutional reason such as the prescription requirement. These obstacles resulted in a 35% increase in contraceptives not being used. [22] The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated: “The most effective way to reduce abortion rates is to prevent unintended pregnancy by improving access to consistent, effective, and affordable contraception... [and a] strategy for improving access to contraception is to allow over-the-counter access to oral contraceptive pills.” [23] The Guttmacher Institute stated that “more and better contraceptive use” caused the 13% decline in abortion rates between 2008 and 2011.

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“The use of drones overseas may have become so convenient, operated as they are from a great distance, that far more ‘collateral damage’ has become acceptable. Collateral damage is a polite way of saying killing innocent civilians… This dramatic increase in the use of drones and the lowered threshold for their use to kill foreigners has tremendous implications for our national security. At home, some claim the use of drones reduces risk to American service members. But this can be true only in the most shortsighted sense. Internationally the expanded use of drones is wildly unpopular and in fact creates more enemies than it eliminates… It is terrifying enough to see how drones are being misused abroad. We must curtail the government’s ability use drones right away lest the massacres in Yemen and Pakistan turn out to be crude training exercises for what the administration has in mind on our own soil.”

The good news is that we have the knowledge, technology, and capacity to make the shift to a renewable energy path—it all hinges on growing solar power.  Solar energy is essential to a renewable energy future. Even after we achieve all possible energy-efficiency gains and take full advantage of other renewable energy sources, such as wind and geothermal, we’ll still need some other way to generate at least 30 percent of our power. (This gap between energy demand and renewable energy supply for all energy, not only electricity, could be as much as 70 percent without aggressive energy efficiency.) That remaining energy must come from solar."""

In the meantime, the ACLU keeps on bringing its absurd First Amendment challenges against the Scouts… The question no one seems to be asking is, who’s better off as a result of these lawsuits? Surely not the 3.2 million Boy Scouts, whose venerable organization is part of the web of voluntary associations once considered the bedrock of American life. If anything, the purpose of the ACLU attacks is to paint Scouts as religious bigots. Other losers are communities themselves, which are forced to sever ties to an organization that helps to build character in young men. It’s been 20 years since the ACLU brought its first suit against the Scouts. If there’s one thing we’ve learned by now, it’s that the ACLU offensive says more about the degraded status of the civil liberties group than it does about the Boy Scouts.”

They own $600 billion in property… The Supreme Court of the United States really needs to take a case about taxing churches because it hasn’t done that since 1970. And since then, religion has become much less popular, especially with younger people… Almost a quarter of us are being forced to subsidize a myth that we’re not buying into. Why am I subsidizing their Sunday morning hobby?… Why, in heaven’s name, don’t we tax religion?”

Under Article I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution, '[e]very natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person's private life.'... This constitutional right of privacy, which exceeds analogous protections under federal constitutional law, includes the right to self-determination with respect to medical treatment, that is, to decide for oneself whether or not to receive such treatment...  The constitutionally protected right to choose or reject medical treatment is not lost by virtue of physical or mental incapacity or incompetence. When the patient can no longer speak, the right may be exercised by a proxy, such as a close family member or friend, upon clear and convincing evidence. A written declaration is presumptively clear and convincing evidence of the patient's wishes. Where, however, a person has not left a written declaration, oral declarations and evidence may constitute clear and convincing evidence of the patient's wishes; the surrogate must make the medical treatment choice that the patient, if competent, would have made...  The Florida legislature has also codified the right to refuse treatment in Chapter 765 of the Florida Statutes. It provides that a health care surrogate or proxy may effectuate the wishes of an incapacitated patient--that is, a patient currently unable to communicate her health care decision--regarding treatment, including a wish to refuse life-prolonging procedures such as artificial nutrition and hydration. The incapacitated patient's right to have her wishes carried out applies even where she has not executed a living will or other written advance directive for health care."""

If nuclear is not considered alternative I am decidedly in the Con camp because I do not believe it is remotely possible to replace fossil fuels with wind, solar, geothermal etc. by themselves. Then there is the question of whether hydroelectricity is 'alternative'. If both hydro and nuclear are not considered alternative then it is doubly impossible to replace fossil fuels with alternatives.   The terms 'renewable', 'sustainable', 'clean', 'green', and 'alternative' tend to be tossed about as if they all mean the same thing when they each have distinct meanings, some of which are less than objective. 'Green', for example, can be a shameless marketing term. 'Clean' is relatively straightforward, meaning there is no pollution involved. Hydroelectric energy is renewable. Nuclear energy is not renewable but it is sustainable.""  [Editor's Note: The term ""alternative energy"" has numerous definitions. On this website ""alternative energy"" refers to any form of energy that is not derived from fossil fuels (oil, coal, or natural gas).

"""Recognizing the unique and intimate nature of religion, the Founding Fathers wisely put religion on a different footing in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment from other forms of speech and observance - mandating strict separation of religion and government to ensure religious freedom for all individuals and faiths. Largely because of the First Amendment's prohibition against government regulation or endorsement of religion, diverse faiths have flourished and thrived in America since the founding of the republic.  Some claim that the First Amendment's Establishment Clause does not really require separation of religion and government because the phrase 'separation of church and state' does not appear in the First Amendment. And others go farther - claiming that the Constitution and our nation's government are based on a particular faith or religious beliefs.  Both claims are false. While it is true that the words 'separation of church and state' do not appear in the Constitution, the writings of key Founding Fathers, other documents from the period, and statements by subsequent U.S. Presidents demonstrate that our government is not based on any religion, and the founders intended a separation of church and state to ensure religious freedom."""

10	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""The nation's founders thought it important to locate the policing function at the local level. Police, they believed, need to be accountable to the communities that know them best. The federal government's co-option of local police for immigration enforcement violates that basic principle and makes policing harder. This approach also tends to mix the functions of criminal law with civil enforcement, resulting in an unappetizing mix that undercuts due-process protections against over-zealous police work and prosecution. The consequences of a simple infraction can suddenly become dire for immigrants and their families and friends, yet basic guarantees like the right to a lawyer and the right to bail and prompt arraignment are not available to those facing deportation.   There is much that needs fixing in the U.S. immigration system and all potential reforms are complex and inevitably controversial.

There are necessarily many intervening pathways between a gene and a specific behavior and even more intervening variables between a gene and a pattern that involves both thinking and behaving. The term ‘homosexual gene’ is, therefore, without meaning, unless one proposes that a particular gene, perhaps through a hormonal mechanism, organizes the brain specifically to support a homosexual orientation.”

10	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“Norwegian researchers conducted a study that took 72 10th grade students, divided them into two groups and gave each a fiction and a non-fiction piece to read. One group was asked to read both texts on a computer screen, while the other group was given hard copies. The study revealed comprehension was clearly stronger among students who read both texts on paper. Researchers argue that’s because reading on paper is inherently a tactile (even multi-sensory!) experience that allows the brain to create a ‘mental map’ of the entire text. Unlike material read on an e-reader or computer screen, students can leaf through a book, quickly see its beginning and end. It’s that process, researchers say, that is crucial particularly when deep comprehension is needed for long and complex texts… Moreover, reading a traditional book provides a respite from the sort of interruptions from texts, games and social media that readers can be bombarded with while attempting to read on a tablet or computer screen. While researchers still have much to learn about children’s preferences and behaviors, it is possible that books deliver a one-of-a-kind, immersive experience that even the most tech-savvy of generations can enjoy, just as readers have for hundreds of years.”
01	Is Wind Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy?	"""Over the last 20 years, the cost of electricity from utility-scale wind systems has dropped by more than 80%. In the early 1980s, when the first utility-scale turbines were installed, wind-generated electricity cost as much as 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Now, state-of-the-art wind power plants can generate electricity for less than 5 cents/kWh in many parts of the U.S., a price that is in a competitive range with many conventional energy technologies...  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is working with the wind industry to develop a next generation of wind turbine technology. The products from this program are expected to generate electricity at prices competitive with natural gas turbines, the least expensive conventional power source."""
01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“There is also the remarkable Reagan record of the second term that includes his three summits with Mikhail Gorbachev that produced the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and set in motion the forces that ended the Cold War without a shot, in Margaret Thatcher’s memorable phrase; his dramatic challenge at the Brandenberg Gate ‘to tear down this wall!’ which came tumbling down some 18 months later; his 1986 tax reform that lowered the top marginal rate from 50 percent to 33 percent, simplified the number of tax brackets, and eliminated hundreds of special interest provisions such as the ‘three martini’ lunch; his leaving office with a final approval rating of 63 percent, the highest of any president to that point… ‘We the people,’ said Reagan, ‘tell the government what to do, it doesn’t tell us.’ The idea of ‘we the people,’ he explained, was the underlying basis for everything he had tried to do as president. And then, having restored Americans’ confidence in themselves and their future, having ignited an unprecedented period of prosperity with his economic reforms, and having ended the Cold War with a treaty and not a nuclear holocaust, he went home, having done his duty and served his country as few presidents have in our history.”
10	Do Poll Workers Receive Adequate Training to Facilitate Elections Conducted on Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Many of the so-called failures of DREs in fact resulted from inadequate training of poll workers in using the equipment. HAVA has created an incentive for counties to rush to procure and begin using DREs. Some jurisdictions have done so without adequate preparation, and have seen failures occur during an election. When machines are tested at the warehouse immediately prior to an election and are found to be working, yet cannot be started on election day morning, it is much more likely that the problem results from unfamiliarity with startup procedures than a sudden and unexplained failure of the equipment."""
01	Is There a Connection between Sexual Orientation and Handedness?	men were, on average, more left-handed than heterosexual women. By contrast, gay men were more right-handed than lesbians or heterosexual men, and lesbians were more left-handed than gay men or heterosexual women. This crossover interaction suggests that a common variable influences sex, sexual orientation, and hand preference.”
10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Considering obesity a chronic disease is a change from the current definition of it as a contributor to chronic diseases, such as diabetes – a change that has already happened in the US in 2013 and in Canada in 2015… Arguments against classifying obesity as a chronic disease include the point that people would have to be treated only because their Body Mass Index is above a certain threshold, even though they may be perfectly healthy. This weakness of basing decisions about one’s health on BMI has, in fact, received much popular attention and was among the main arguments against declaring obesity a chronic disease presented by the American Medical Association’s own Council on Science and Public Health. Evidence has also emerged that individuals can be ‘fat but fit.’ Finally, in more severe cases, once obesity is seen as a chronic disease, individuals may be denied employment or insurance. Classifying obesity as a chronic disease appears to be based on a flawed BMI tool that is ill-equipped to measure fat tissue versus muscle mass; the argument also seems to rest on the unsupported premise that calling it a disease will automatically reduce, if not remove, the stigma. Against this background, it might be wiser to stick with the status quo.”
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“No one disputes that education is unequal in California and the United States. Poorer children and children of color are disadvantaged in the educational system. But the tenure system for teachers is not responsible for this, nor will altering it improve education for those who most need reform… Every year, the states with the highest student performance are states, like Maryland and Massachusetts, with robust protection of teachers. One of the key reasons they are successful is that these states do a better job at getting resources to the neediest students and creating a climate where teachers have the support needed to succeed and therefore stay in the profession. The problem of inner-city schools is not that the dedicated teachers who work in them have too many rights, but that the schools have inadequate resources, the students who go to them are disadvantaged in many ways, and the schools are surrounded by communities that are dangerous, lack essential services and are largely segregated both by race and class. Taking away from teachers the modest job security accorded by tenure will address none of these problems.”

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The next diplomatic formula that will replace the 'two states for two peoples' will be a civilian formula. All the people between the Jordan and the sea have the same right to equality, justice and freedom. In other words, there is a very reasonable chance that there will be only one state between the Jordan and the sea - neither ours nor theirs but a mutual one...  The conceptual framework will be agreed upon - a democratic state that belongs to all of its citizens. The practicable substance could be fertile ground for arguments and creativity. This is an opportunity worth taking, despite our grand experience of missing every opportunity and accusing everyone else except ourselves."""
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause… Our [Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project] results show that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases… We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from human intervention and data adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions… [O]ur record is long enough that we could search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent… How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we’ve tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect — extra warming from trapped heat radiation… our analysis does not depend on large, complex global climate models, the huge computer programs that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.” [Editor’s Note: The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project published the results of its research on Oct. 11, 2011, as four draft papers: “Influence of Urban Heating on the Global Temperature Land Average” , “Earth Atmospheric Land Surface Temperature and Station Quality in the United States” , “Berkeley Earth Temperature Averaging Process” (1MB) , and “Decadal Variations in the Global Atmospheric Land Temperatures” .]
10	Is the ACLU Good for America?	ACLU will assure Muslim clerics and imams the right to pray on planes, fight for an atheist’s rights to remove a cross, stand beside pro-abortionists, help illegal aliens cross our borders, and establish rights for the sexual deviant by forming the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project, but what is it doing for Christians and Christmas censorship? While allegedly fighting against the tyranny of the majority, the ACLU itself rules religiously by litigation, lobbying, and supporting counter-culture Christian movements. So who died and appointed the ACLU as America’s religious constitutional watchdog? Membership for the ACLU is only 500,000. America’s population is 300 million. I think it’s time that we helped them feel their size!”
01	Should State or Local Governments Help Enforce Federal Immigration Laws?	"""The arguments in favor of local-state-federal cooperation on immigration enforcement are straightforward, particularly after the shooting death of Kate Steinle. Cooperation with local police is a significant force-multiplier for DHS because there are 750,000 police officers in the United States, compared to about 5,000 DHS enforcement and removal officers (excluding border personnel). And cooperation is the surest way to ensure the deportation of serious criminals like Lopez-Sanchez, who typically come into the immigration system through an encounter with the police (though in this particular case San Francisco had custody following a transfer from ICE after Lopez-Sanchez had completed a federal prison sentence for illegal re-entry). """
10	Does a Person's Race Affect the Likelihood of Him/Her Receiving the Death Penalty?	"""As of December 2005, there were 37 prisoners under a sentence of death in the federal system. Of these prisoners, 43.2 percent were white, while 54.1 percent were African–American. The fact that African–Americans are a majority of federal prisoners on death row and a minority in the overall United States population may lead some to conclude that the federal system discriminates against African–Americans. However, there is little rigorous evidence that such disparities exist in the federal system…  Americans support capital punishment for two good reasons. First, there is little evidence to suggest that minorities are treated unfairly. Second, capital punishment produces a strong deterrent effect that saves lives.”"
10	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""[E]thanol consumes just 4% of world grain (corn, rice, wheat, soy, etc.). Common sense suggests that food-crop derived biofuels would [play] a similarly small role in overall grain prices...  While I worry that the current mud-fight over food vs. fuel will lead to dangerously blunt policies that would throw out the biofuels baby with the bath water, I worry more that the mud-fight will distract us from doing something serious about world hunger. The argument that we should address the starvation being caused by current high prices through minimizing the production of biofuels from food crops is wrong and distracts us from the real solutions. This argument is basically calling for addressing world hunger by encouraging overproduction here in the U.S. (Less corn ethanol means more supply, more supply means lower prices -- or so the argument goes.) But overproduction in developed countries comes at a high cost to our environment, to farmers around the world, and ultimately to the economies of the countries with the most hungry. Overproduction is what we've had for decades, and it has crushed farmers in developing countries around the world. Subsidized overproduction and the resulting cheap food does trickle down to feed more people, but it's not sustainable -- nor is it the most effective way to feed the poor...  U.S. consumption of meat and oil are ultimately the biggest culprits here. The idea that changing our biofuels policy is the only thing the most affluent country on earth can do to make sure the poorest have enough food is just an abdication of responsibility."""
01	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""Nuclear energy to produce electricity commercially began in the U.S. in 1957. Since then, it has proven itself as one of our safest energy technologies. Safety is a major consideration throughout the design, construction, and operation of a nuclear power plant. Hundreds of systems monitor, control, and support the safe operation of the reactor at each power plant. These systems provide maximum safety and reliability and reduce the chance of an accidental release of radioactivity into the environment...  The nuclear industry has rigid safety standards, which the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] sets and regulates. Utilities operating nuclear power plants must prove to the NRC that each plant can meet these stringent safety standards. Periodic inspections also ensure that each facility operates safely. Utilities face severe financial penalties if NRC inspections show that the plant is not operating in full compliance with federal regulations...  Since 1957, utilities in the U.S. have operated commercial nuclear power plants. During this time, no one in the U.S. has died or been injured as a result of operations at a commercial nuclear power plant. Efforts to ensure that nuclear power plants maintain this safety record are constantly emphasized, and the record compares favorably with all other ways of making electricity."""
10	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""One of my main objections to doping is that it's dangerous. Doping can cause blood clots, hurt our immune system, and it can create strokes and infections. So it's quite dangerous. Secondly, I've treated a number of athletes who have involved with doping and anabolic steroid use, and I can tell you that clinically these people present just like addicts, and we don't need more addicts in sports we don't need more addicts in society. I think this [allowing doping in sports] would be a mistake. I think we would be opening the floodgates. Young people will model and imitate what they see people do. They'll get involved with this at an earlier and earlier stage in life. And then we're going to have some deaths, and some problems, and we're going to feel kind of bad about loosening the regulations.  The purity of sports, the beauty of sports is about athletes competing with a sound mind and a sound body. We don’t want the athlete with the best chemist, best pharmacist, or the best transfusionist to be the champion."""

Therefore the Israelites were prohibited from doing this, not because it was an act between two men but because it was symbolic of pagan ritual. In today’s world this prohibition now has no meaning. We are no longer threatened by Canaanite pagan religion and homosexuality today is not a pagan ritual. Homosexuality in Biblical terms is no longer an issue for us today. As a religious community, there are many scriptural verses that require us to accept and welcome gays and lesbians into our community as equals… ALL people, not just heterosexuals are created in God’s image.”
10	Does Christianity Support the Death Penalty?	"""The Holy See has consistently sought the abolition of the death penalty...  Where the death penalty is a sign of desperation, civil society is invited to assert its belief in a justice that salvages hope from the ruin of the evils which stalk our world. The universal abolition of the death penalty would be a courageous reaffirmation of the belief that humankind can be successful in dealing with criminality and of our refusal to succumb to despair before such forces, and as such it would regenerate new hope in our very humanity."""

01	Dakota Access Pipeline: Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline will help the United States to become more energy independent. There are 2.5 million miles of oil and gas pipelines currently running through the United States. [23] Reducing oil imports from the Middle East, Russia, and elsewhere lowers US dependence on foreign energy, which in turn bolsters national security and creates leverage to push for human rights improvements in oil-producing nations. [30] Oil imports account for nearly two-thirds of the US annual trade deficit, but North Dakota's 251% increase in oil production since 2010 can significantly cut back on the billions of dollars leaving the US economy.

Today, we have record low apprehensions on our southern border. We are spending record amounts--$18 billion a year--to secure it. We have doubled the size of the Border Patrol from 10,000 to 20,000 in the last 10 years, and we have hundreds of miles of walls.   We have also heard from the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Director of the FBI that there is not now, nor has there ever been, a credible terrorist threat on our southern border.

"""James Madison, the father of both the Constitution and the First Amendment, consistently warned against any attempt to blend endorsement of Christianity into the law of the new nation...

Article VI provides that all state and federal officials 'shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.' The First Amendment's Establishment Clause... provides that 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion'--meaning that not only no church but no 'religion' could be made the official faith of the United States. Finally the Free Exercise Clause provides that Congress shall not make laws 'prohibiting the free exercise' of religion...

More cannabinoids are absorbed in inhaled form than in ingested form, since the body attempts to metabolize any ingested medication before absorption.”
10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government, so their tax exemptions are not justified.

Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing. [31] Read More
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“[W]e should also recognize legalization for what it is: the large-scale commercialization and marketing of an addictive — and therefore highly profitable — substance… In states that have legalized, youth marijuana use now exceeds the national average, the black market continues to thrive and employers struggle with more drug-impaired workers than before pot was legalized. More heavy users of marijuana are reporting to drug treatment, and there have been more school infractions among kids caught with pot. Worse still, the only statistically representative national survey on marijuana use found last year that Colorado is the No. 1 state for youth marijuana use in the country. Without action, the marijuana industry is poised to become the next Big Tobacco — a profit-hungry special-interest group looking after profits, not public health.

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely [95% confidence] to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.”

01	Election Day National Holiday - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Making weekday elections a national holiday is a popular idea that would align the US with other countries. Pew Research Center found that 71% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans support making Election Day a federal holiday. [15] A survey showed that US adults would rather have a federal holiday on Election Day than on Christmas Eve, the Friday after Thanksgiving, or St. Patrick's day. [16] The United States is in the minority by holding non-holiday weekday elections. Elections are held on weekends in 27 of the 36 OECD countries. [15] Israel and South Korea make national elections a holiday to avoid economic hardship for voters. The result is voter turnout rates of 72.3% and 77.2% respectively, which is 26-32% higher than the United States. [8][15] A holiday for elections sidesteps the issue of a weekend election, which could conflict with religious obligations. Elections are federal holidays in Singapore, which, when combined with mandatory voting, resulted in a voter turnout of 93.6% for the 2015 election of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. [17] Countries such as France, Mexico, and India also observe federal holidays for elections. [18][19]

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“ACOG has long supported over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives. Birth control is an essential part of women’s health care, and over-the-counter status would help more women benefit from the ability to control their own reproductive health. Of course, decades of use have proven that oral contraceptives are safe for the vast majority of women, and that they are safer than many other medications that are already available over-the-counter… [W]e know from evidence and experience that oral contraceptives are safe enough for over-the-counter access, and do not require any prescription at all. Research has shown that women are very adept at self-screening for any potential risks. And, although some women may be at elevated risk of thromboembolism associated with hormonal contraceptives, we know that pregnancy raises that risk to a larger degree, so the ability to prevent pregnancy actually protects these women. Quite simply, the benefit of facilitating access to birth control is extensive – from helping some women prevent pregnancy reliably for the first time to improving adherence among long-term birth control users.”
10	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""Though logical, such acceptance or legalization of performance-enhancing aids has serious ramifications.

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“All the fear-mongering about the debt and the deficit, all the inflation scares of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, and all the wrong-headed ignorance about bankruptcy and collapse of the dollar are based on the outmoded and archaic economic model called the gold standard… If America were on the gold standard, there would be real constraints on spending, since the U.S. Treasury would only be able to spend what it could borrow or collect in taxes. The Federal Reserve system, in the same way, would only be able to supply money in proportion to the gold it has backing that currency… The funny thing is, mainline economists, pundits, politicians and even President Barack Obama and the U.S. Treasury are all acting as though we were on the gold standard and that we were bound by all of those constraints. We are not… The United States of America is a sovereign country that has a fiat currency. The Federal Reserve can say, Genesis-like, ‘let there be money’ – and money appears… With a fiat money, the Federal Reserve can create and loan trillions of dollars to the business community when those dollars are needed in the midst of a financial crisis, as in 2008. The U.S. Treasury can run fiscal deficits of whatever size is needed to put the unemployed to work… Thank God we are not on the gold standard. If we were, all of those horrible fears would be justified. We would have to institute austerity budgeting, deleverage credit, increase taxes and tighten the money supply… With a fiat currency, we can and should create the buying power necessary to put all the people to work, increase national output and make everyone better off. Issuing this money will not cause inflation unless we are already at full employment. Those 23 million are idle resources who, despite nasty claims to the contrary, want to work.”

01	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	working with AIDS and cancer patients, I repeatedly saw how marijuana could ameliorate a patient’s debilitating fatigue, restore appetite, diminish pain, remedy nausea, cure vomiting and curtail down-to-the-bone weight loss. The federal obsession with a political agenda that keeps marijuana out of the hands of sick and dying people is appalling and irrational. Washington bureaucrats — far removed from the troubled bedsides of sick and dying patients — are ignoring what patients and doctors and health care workers are telling them about real world suffering. The federal refusal to honor public referendums like California’s voter-approved Medical Marijuana Initiative is as bewildering as it is ominous. Its refusal to listen to doctors groups like the California Medical Association that support compassionate use of medical marijuana is chilling. In a society that has witnessed extensive positive experiences with medicinal marijuana, as long as it is safe and not proven to be ineffective, why shouldn’t seriously ill patients have access to it? Why should an old woman be made to die a horrible death for a hollow political symbol?”
10	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""There are compelling reasons for patients to opt out of Obamacare, Medicaid, and even Medicare. The most important reason is poor access to high quality physicians. Few of these currently accept Medicaid patients, and more each day are declining to accept new Medicare patients. A large element of the Obamacare strategy is to expand Medicaid to families with incomes well above the poverty line. A silver lining in the otherwise horrendous Roberts court decision upholding Obamacare is the ability of states to refuse to expand Medicaid, and a large number have taken advantage of this... 'Private' insurance policies available under the Obamacare exchanges will strongly resemble Medicaid, with limited options and poor physician participation. And unless you qualify for subsidies, the premiums will be very high, especially if you are relatively young and healthy...  Also remember that Medicaid and subsidized insurance is effectively a poverty trap, since you are penalized with loss of insurance for earning above a certain level.   Obamacare is turning out to be every bit of the disaster that many of us predicted it would be. Participation will be costly, exposes you to identity theft and loss of confidentiality, and will limit your access to quality medical care. It is time for patients to declare independence from government health care. This will inspire more physicians to opt out, to meet the increased demand for private care."""
10	Can Sexual Orientation Be Successfully Changed?	is highly doubtful that the so-called ‘conversion therapies’ and ‘reparative therapies’ are actually able to change a person’s sexual orientation. Claims about their success are based on scattered anecdotal reports, not on rigorous scientific studies that have been subjected to review by other scientists. Some individuals with a strong motivation to become heterosexual – often based on intense religious beliefs – claim to have changed their sexual orientation as a result of these therapies. Even if their claims about changing are accepted, however, there is no evidence that such change was brought about by the therapy. The change – if it occurred – may well have happened without therapy. And for every story about someone whose sexual orientation was supposedly converted to heterosexuality, there are many other reports of people who tried unsuccessfully to change and who endured a great deal of psychological pain and suffering in the process.”

Right now, coal-fired power plants can remove some of the sulphur from the pollution that the plants spew out of their smokestacks. But the carbon – which is our number one enemy, which is the pollutant that is literally cooking the planet – cannot be effectively captured when power plants burn carbon. The technology simply does not exist.  Besides, show me a clean process for strip-mining, or for mountain-top removal. Coal is not just dirty to burn. It is dirty to mine. The reason we hear all this chatter about clean coal is that the coal industry is dumping millions of dollars into a PR campaign. Clean coal does represent a breakthrough – in the marketing of coal. But it does not represent a breakthrough in the burning of coal.  If we are going to call for clean coal, we may as well promote other fantasy fuels, too. Why not? For instance, let's propose that unicorns pull our cars for us. Let's propose that the tooth fairy bring us our energy at night and leave it under our pillow. All three of those ideas – clean coal, cars pulled by unicorn and the tooth fairy bringing us energy – are equally fanciful and ludicrous."""
01	Mandatory National Service - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Compulsory service would save the government money and provide benefits to all citizens. National service programs are a proven cost-effective method to address critical needs in the country. [16] A report from the Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education found that youth national service programs in the United States cost a total of $1.7 billion annually and returned a value of $6.5 billion, creating a social benefit of 3.95 times more than the cost. For every one dollar of taxpayer money spent on youth service programs, over two dollars of savings resulted. [17] The National Park Service estimates that using a civilian conservation corps to maintain national parks saves an average of 65% and as much as 87% on backlogged projects. [18] Policy Study Associates found that schools that had support from the existing national service program City Year AmeriCorps were two- to three-times more likely to see improvements in English and math proficiency among students. [19] AmeriCorps members helped 25,000 unemployed coal miners in Eastern Kentucky find jobs in other industries and contributed to a 26% decrease in violent crime in Detroit by forming neighborhood watches and escorting kids to school. [20][21] If national service were mandatory, just as jury duty is required of everyone, the number of participants would grow and the resulting benefits would be exponentially higher.

But here's a way to deal with the steroid users: Have everyone take a polygraph test. If you fail, you're out; and publish the results. Then we'll see how many players want to get into the Hall.  Otherwise, if Barry Bonds gets in, then Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Pudge Rodriguez and Rafael Palmiero and anyone else who has credentials has to get in. And if these guys get in under the suspicion that they cheated the game and their ability, then is betting on games the way Pete Rose did really that bad in comparison?

10	Would Increasing Legal Immigration Reduce Illegal Immigration?	"""[A] glaring omission guarantees that the illegal population will continue to grow: Congress and the administration emphasized that illegal immigration should be dealt with separately from legal immigration. Proponents of this approach argue that the two are distinct; that one constitutes lawless behavior, while the other is a lawful process. This view results from a fundamental misunderstanding of how immigration works. In fact, legal and illegal immigration are merely two parts of the same process. And there can be no successful control of illegal immigration without changes and reductions in its legal cousin. Why are they linked? Because the volume of legal immigration has risen together with illegal immigration. Legal immigration increased from 3.3 million in the 1960s to 7.3 million in the 1980s. At the same time, apprehensions of illegal immigrants by the Border Patrol increased from 1.6 million in the 1960s to 11.9 million in the 1980s. It is no coincidence that legal and illegal immigration have risen in tandem. The communities of legal immigrants formed since the mid-60s serve as incubators for illegal immigration by providing housing, jobs and entrée for their compatriots who haven't yet managed to procure a green card."""
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“There is this kind of marketing that is designed to convince people that they need pills. It’s designed to convince them that they need particular pills that happen to be more expensive, or just going on patent rather than coming off. Then, armed with this feeling, the consumer goes to the physician, who often just prescribes the pills. It’s a buyer’s market here. Doctors don’t want to lose patients. They don’t want to say no to patients. They’re, in some sense, too busy to say no to patients. They are forced to see more and more patients more and more rapidly. It’s faster to write out a prescription than it is to try to talk with patient and convince the patient that he or she may have been manipulated by these ads. In addition, the doctors themselves are manipulated by the same ads, and also by what amounts to bribery from the drug companies. The drug companies turn up. They have $8 billion worth of free samples that they give to doctors. The doctors hand out the free samples to patients. It makes the doctor look good. The patient has free samples. But both the doctor and the patient, from that point on, are hooked on that particular drug. And believe me, it’s not going to be a generic, and it’s not going to be a drug that’s just going off patent. It is going to be a new, newly patented, high-price drug. So in a sense, both the doctors and the consumers are sucked into a sort of ‘bait and switch,’ because sooner or later they will have to pay for [that drug.]”

Alternative energy is most developed in countries where government subsidies have been in place for some time. Germany put in place strong incentives in the early part of this decade to encourage demand for solar modules, to encourage installations of wind farms and to support the biofuels industry. Companies in countries with a more progressive alternative energy policy framework therefore developed technology and intellectual property at an earlier state. Other European countries such as Denmark, Spain and Portugal also embraced alternative energy therefore companies tend to be more mature in Europe.

10	Is the ACLU against Christmas or Other Religious Holidays?	ACLU is committed to defending the religious freedom of all Americans and keeping our national tradition of religious diversity alive and well. To protect religious liberty for everyone in America, however, the ACLU is often in the position of defending the minority from the will of the majority. In some instances, this involves challenging nativity displays or the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property. We are a nation founded on religious freedom. As such, the ACLU believes our society should be particularly sensitive to the legitimate complaints that government-sponsored displays and other actions that promote religion are offensive and inappropriate to those who belong to minority faiths and to non-believers. The ACLU believes that no person should be made to feel like an outsider by his or her own government. This in no way infringes upon the rights of individuals — individuals and private groups, after all, have the right to display religious symbols on their own private property. However, the ACLU believes that there are better ways, other than the use of religious displays, for governmental entities to wish their constituents well during the holiday season.”

10	Have Health Insurance Premiums Been Rising at a Faster Rate Under Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""We estimate that, on net, the combination of provisions in the new law will reduce health care spending by $590 billion over 2010–2019 and lower premiums by nearly $2,000 per family. Moreover, the annual growth rate in national health expenditures could be slowed from 6.3 percent to 5.7 percent...  Reducing insurer administration and modernizing the delivery of health care services will each result in reductions in private insurance premiums. Private premiums might be affected by other provisions as well. For example, an excise tax on high-premium health insurance plans, set to take effect in 2018, will introduce a strong financial incentive for insurers to trim benefits and reduce costs below a tax-free threshold of $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. Indexing this cap to the overall rate of inflation in the economy plus one percentage point will encourage insurers to seek out value and efficiency continually, thus placing downward pressure on premiums over time."""

"""Carbon dioxide—the greenhouse gas mainly emitted by human activity—is the major focus of policy discussions to reduce emissions. At a time when the United States faces a projected 25 percent increase in electricity demand by 2030, failure to develop a holistic policy that meets the nation's energy demand, energy security needs and greenhouse gas reduction goals could threaten success on both objectives.  Nuclear power plants produce large amounts of electricity without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases...  Nuclear power plants already play a powerful role in preventing greenhouse gases in the electricity sector. By using nuclear energy rather than fossil fuel-based plants, electric utilities prevented 681 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2006. For perspective, the volume of greenhouse gas emissions prevented at nuclear power plants is equivalent to taking 96 percent of all passenger cars off America's roadways.  A credible program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require a portfolio of technologies and approaches, including the widespread use of nuclear energy."""

Secretary of State Kerry's sterling efforts have produced regrettably few results, perhaps because he addressed only part of the problem. But the international community cannot give up. Credible polls show that the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians still want a two-state solution. The only alternatives are the status quo or a binational state of some kind. Both are a dead end. The status quo means drift, more settlements, Gaza imprisoned and isolated with more extremism, and Israel retreating to another Masada fortress… There is no secure future in the status quo for Israelis or Palestinians.  As to the binational state or one-state solution, Kerry's withdrawn public reference to apartheid was in fact right. The population trends show that there are at present 6 million Israeli Jews, with a similar and rapidly growing population of Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. If this is to be a Jewish nation, it would, in all likelihood, lead to an apartheid nation of Bantustans, where democracy would be undermined by the treatment of Palestinians as second-class citizens.

Alcohol and tobacco are legal, yet they are known to cause cancer, heart failure, liver damage, and more. According to the CDC, six people die from alcohol poisoning every day and 88,000 people die annually due to excessive alcohol use in the United States. [45][168] There are no recorded cases of death from marijuana overdose. [46][47] Three to four times as many Americans are dependent on alcohol as on marijuana. [33] A study in the Lancet ranking the harmfulness of drugs put alcohol first as the most harmful, tobacco as sixth, and cannabis eighth. [48] A national poll found that people view tobacco as a greater threat to health than marijuana by a margin of four to one (76% vs. 18%), and 72% of people surveyed believed that regular use of alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana use.

01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“[T]o protect their health and the health of their families, women facing an unintended pregnancy must have access to safe, legal abortion services without interference from the government. Decisions about childbearing should be made by a woman in consultation with her family and doctor — not by politicians. Access to abortion is legal, constitutionally protected, and consistently supported by a majority of Americans; yet anti-choice organizations and policymakers have made it increasingly harder for women to access needed care. Anti-choice hardliners erode access to abortion through court battles, ballot measures, and burdensome legislative restrictions on abortion services — some extremists even resort to intimidation, harassment, and violence against women and health care providers.”
10	Should the Penny Stay in Circulation? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The process of making pennies is costly both financially and environmentally. At a total per unit cost of 1.82 cents, it costs nearly two pennies to make one penny. [1] Aaron Klein, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department, estimates that the United States could see $1.78 billion in losses over the next 30 years if the penny remains in production. [23] Making pennies also has environmental consequences from mining and transportation. Mining zinc and copper produces carbon dioxide emissions and pollutants, and uses vast amounts of energy. [24] Over the last 35 years, 107 million pounds of carbon dioxide have been emitted due to pennies being delivered from the Mint to banks. [25] A California company called Mike’s Bikes has banned the penny from its registers because ""Making pennies wastes natural resources [and] is toxic to people and the environment."" [26]"
10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	Vegetarians do not live longer. This myth stems from the fact that vegetarians tend to be more health conscious overall, eating a more balanced diet, exercising more, and smoking less than the general population.

01	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Social media is critically important in giving voice to communities who’ve been systemically excluded from media – people of color, women, LGBTQIA people, poor people. By giving people a chance to share their under-covered perspectives with broadcast media, social media has a possible role in making the media ecosystem more inclusive and fair… The power of social media to raise money for candidates, recruit people to participate in marches and rallies, to organize boycotts of products or the overthrow of governments is one of the best-documented – and most debated – powers of social media.”
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“Advances in high band-width satellite communications, sensing technologies – particularly full motion video – combined with existing aircraft technology has allowed armed drones to emerge as the platform of choice in this counter terror mission space. In military operations, these drones are highly capable and sought after by ground forces. They cost roughly $4-5M versus a modern fighter’s $150M. They persist on station for 15-20 hours without refueling, versus 1-2 hours for fighter attack aircraft. They consume 100 gallons of fuel per flight versus 1,000-3,000 gallons for an unrefueled fighter attack aircraft. Their optics provides full motion imagery at far greater distances and altitudes than the human eye, and the crews are not distracted or disabled by the constant duties of flight. Their sensor information can be distributed to fixed and mobile users in real time. Drones offer many advantages over other conventional forces in counter terrorism missions. Basing can be located far from the area of interest without sacrificing time on station. They have far greater mobility than a similar ground or naval capability. Their elevated sensors are generally more effective in locating and pursuing a threat. They can persist in an area for extended periods of time awaiting emergence or a clear opportunity. They can quickly adapt to fixed and mobile targets. These and many other attributes of armed drones make them the leading choice in counter terrorism operations.”
10	Is There Any Safety or Nutritional Difference in Milk from Cows Supplemented with Growth Hormones Such as rBST and Milk from Cows Not Supplemented with Hormones?	"""[Some people] express concern that growth hormones in milk could raise the risk of hormone-related cancers, or lead to higher levels of an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) linked with cancer. But BGH [bovine growth hormone] is a protein hormone, which means that if any does appear in milk, enzymes and acid in our digestive tract destroy it...   If IGF-1 is slightly higher in milk from BGH-treated cows, it represents a tiny fraction of the IGF we all produce each day.

Secretary Sebelius also announced today that, in 2011, over 150,000 primary care providers nationwide received almost $560 million in higher Medicare payments because of the Affordable Care Act. This is another way the Affordable Care Act rewards doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other primary care providers who are central to our health care system...  Today's proposed rule would implement the Affordable Care Act's requirement that Medicaid reimburse family medicine, general internal medicine, pediatric medicine, and related subspecialists at Medicare levels in CY 2013 and CY 2014.

10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Social media encourages aggressive discourse. The louder one is on Twitter, for example, the more followers and attention one receives. The more dramatic the update on Facebook, the more ‘likes’ it will get. Given the brevity of Twitter and its inherent commodification of discourse, deep discussion is discouraged. As such, social media provides the illusion of empowering users when in fact it merely entrenches their views, silos them with like-minded people and encourages rude exchanges with adversaries. The American novelist Jonathan Franzen, known for his critical views on the internet, has called Twitter the ‘ultimate irresponsible medium’ for these reasons.”

That is true for guys who fight oil well fires, tame lions, or do dangerous stunts for the movies, as well.

10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“Companies hire because they need people to compete and keep customers happy, not because of lower tax rates. The same principle applies to hiring. It is incredibly expensive to hire people. You hire people because you need them. You don’t hire them because your taxes are lower. You don’t hire them because you just repatriated cash from a foreign country. You hire them because you have a specific need for them. They are going to help you become more profitable, more productive, more competitive, whatever the reason. No one hires people simply because they have some more cash in the bank… Bottom line is that while CEOs of public companies and financial engineers have good reasons to ask for lower taxes, I don’t see lower taxes creating jobs.”

10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“The social experiment in abortion on demand, imposed by the judiciary in 1973, has disastrously failed by ending the lives of more than 30 million children while damaging the physical and emotional health of millions of women… [A]bortion is a violent deception that results in two victims: the child whose life is destroyed, and the woman who suffers devastating physical and psychological harm… Unfortunately, the Roe v. Wade decision and its progeny have created a cultural ethic that views destruction of innocent human life as an acceptable solution to personal, economic, or social problems. Rather than respecting the dignity of each individual human life and seeking humane and creative solutions to our personal and social problems, Roe [v.

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Amnesty International considers that to protect the rights of sex workers, it is necessary not only to repeal laws which criminalize the sale of sex, but also to repeal those which make the buying of sex from consenting adults or the organization of sex work (such as prohibitions on renting premises for sex work) a criminal offence...  The fact that various aspects of sex work are treated as criminal conduct in many countries means that sex workers cannot rely on support or protection from the police. For many sex workers, reporting crimes experienced during the course of their work means putting themselves at risk of criminalization and/or penalization on the basis of their involvement in sex work, seizure of their earnings, potential loss of their livelihood through related sanctions and/or monitoring by the police to detect their clients. As a result, sex workers are frequently unable to seek redress for crimes committed against them, thereby offering impunity to perpetrators. In addition, the stigmatized and criminalized status that sex workers experience gives law enforcement officials in many countries the scope to harass, extort and perpetrate physical and sexual violence against them, also with impunity. When they are not threatened with criminalization/penalization, sex workers are better able to collaborate with law enforcement to identify perpetrators of violence and abuse, including human trafficking."""

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""I have listened for my whole professional life to a false dialogue. For years, policy makers and opinion leaders have argued over 'solutions' that are unreal or at last tangential: We keep chanting the dirge: one can almost put it to music -- one state or two states.

It is time to drop the nonsense and face the simple facts. They are:   In the 'one state,' the Arabs will be the subjugated minority with few rights and little or any security -- they will be the 'Jews' of an Israeli Germany or an Israeli Imperial Russia, cooped up in ghettos, imprisoned, driven into exile or subjected to a final partition. They, their children and their grandchildren will sporadically resist. Their resistance will call forth more hatred and more reprisal. The cycle will continue.

When asked about homosexuality, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of the international Art of Living movement, said, ‘Every individual has both male and female in them. Sometimes one dominates, sometimes other; it is all fluid.’ Mathematician Shakuntala Devi, in her 1977 book The World of Homosexuals, interviewed Srinivasa Raghavachariar, head priest of the Srirangam temple. Raghavachariar said that same-sex partners must have been cross-sex partners in a former life. The sex may change, he said, but the soul retains its attachments; hence love impels them toward one another.”
10	Should Terri Schiavo's Feeding Tube Have Been Removed?	"""As soon as Terri Schiavo's case moved into the law courts of Florida, the concept of 'life under altered circumstances' went by the boards--and so, necessarily, did any consideration of how to serve such life...  Terri Schiavo's husband and his clinical and legal advisers, believing that hers was now a life unworthy of life, sought, and achieved, its annihilation. Claiming to respect her undocumented wish not to live dependently, they were willing to have her suffer pain and, by specific force of law, to block her caregivers from offering her oral feedings of the kind provided to all terminal patients in a hospice-even to the point of prohibiting mouth-soothing ice chips. Everything else flowed from there. How could such a thing happen? This, after all, is not Nazi Germany... But we in this country have our own, homegrown culture of death, whose face is legal and moral and benignly individualistic rather than authoritarian and pseudo-scientific...  Contemporary bioethics has become a natural ally of the culture of death, but the culture of death itself is a perennial human temptation; for onlookers in particular, it offers a reassuring answer ('this is how X would have wanted it') to otherwise excruciating dilemmas, and it can be rationalized every which way till Sunday. In Terri Schiavo's case, it is what won out over the hospice's culture of life."""

There are millions of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Shintoists, Unitarians, Hindus, Wiccans, Naturists, Agnostics, and Atheists, but Christians comprise roughly 84% of the population. Our constitutional legal system is still based on the Jewish/Christian Bible, not the Koran or other holy book. We still observe Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, as an official holiday. Easter and Christmas still have a special place in the holiday lexicon. The Ten Commandments are still on the wall behind the Supreme Court Justices when they take the bench. Our coins still display the motto 'In God We Trust.'... We live, not under a Christian government, but in a nation where all are free to practice their particular religion, in accommodation with other religions, and in accordance with the basic principles of the nation, which are Christian in origin.

01	Is a College Education Worth It?	“After World War II, the United States economy promised middle-class jobs to high school graduates. As late as the 1970s, more than 70 percent of middle-class jobs still required only high school or less, but between 1973 and 2010, the share of jobs requiring education beyond high school more than doubled, to more than 60 percent from 28 percent. Furthermore, since the ’80s access to college is what has distinguished the middle class from the growing number of low-income Americans. People with at least some college are staying in the middle class or moving up. In addition, the rate of successful family formation has ties to college access; 8 percent of college-educated women bear children out of wedlock, compared to more than 57 percent of women who are not college educated. Our research shows that individuals with college degrees now make 84 percent more over their lifetimes than those with only a high school diploma, up from 40 percent in 1983. Only a third of high school jobs that provide anything close to family-sustaining earnings ($35,000 a year) still exist, and these opportunities are mostly for men in declining industries.”
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	The embargo should be maintained because open travel is insufficient to promote change in Cuba; many democratic countries already allow travel to Cuba with no results. Lifting all travel restrictions to Cuba would not lead to improved conditions or the spread of democracy. More than 2.7 million people from around the world visited Cuba in 2011, including more tourists from Canada than any other country. [14] Despite the steady flow of tourism from western countries, the Cuban government still maintains total control over its people. Most Cuban nationals are banned from tourist areas such as resorts and beaches, so there would be limited contact with US citizens vacationing there. [63] [59] Read More

01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today’s retirees. If you are a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future. Here is why personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver — and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you’ll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. We will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We will make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We will make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. We will make sure a personal account can’t be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits. And we will make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.”
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Motor vehicle crashes are the number one cause of death for persons between 15 and 20 years of age. During the 1980s, the nation saw a reduction in alcohol-related fatal crashes, directly attributable to raising the legal minimum age for the sale and public possession of alcohol to age 21. It is estimated that minimum drinking age laws, imperfect as they are, have prevented nearly 25,000 fatalities since 1975. The fact that a minor, who cannot legally purchase alcohol, has a positive BAC demonstrates that underage drinking and driving remains a problem. Teenage drivers with a BAC between 0.05 and 0.10 percent are far more likely to be killed in single vehicle crashes than sober drivers or older drivers with similar BAC levels. Young drivers comprise about 7 percent of licensed drivers but 16 percent of the alcohol-involved drivers in fatal crashes. In 2005, 23 percent of young drivers killed in motor vehicle crashes had an illegal (0.08 percent or greater) BAC. More than 60 percent of youth alcohol-related crash fatalities occurred in rural areas… Because underage drinking and driving remains a problem, Florida needs comprehensive Age 21 laws.”

10	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Here is what you need to know: [legal and undocumented] immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States…   The 2000 census shows that in all racial categories, immigrants are much less likely to be incarcerated than their U.S.-born counterparts. Men born in Mexico had an incarceration rate five times lower than the U.S.-born population as a whole…   If immigrants were disproportionately likely to commit crimes, we would expect to see higher crime rates when and where immigrants arrive. Yet the opposite holds true. From 1994 to 2007, the number of immigrants per capita living in the United States rose from about 9 to 13 percent of the population. At the same time, FBI reports show that the rate of violent crime declined 34.2 percent. The property crime rate fell 26.4 percent.   Cities with large immigrant populations such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York also experienced declining crime rates during this period. The 2008 California study found that cities with relatively larger inflows of immigrants between 2000 and 2005 tended to see lower rates of violent crime. Contrary to the image of crime spilling across the border, FBI records show that rates of murder and other violent crimes are lower in U.S. cities within 100 miles of the border. The lowest murder rate of any U.S. city over 500,000 is El Paso, Texas."""

10	Is It Misleading to Label Milk as Free of the Artificial Growth Hormone rBST/rBGH?	"""On the one hand is milk from cows never given rbST, which in turn cannot produce milk that has rbST as a matter of fact. The composition claim 'rbST free' is therefore demonstrably true as applied to this milk. On the other hand, milk from cows treated with rbST might contain the artificial hormone, although there is currently no way to determine whether that is the case. But even if rbST is not present in conventional milk, there is still evidence that it contains increased levels of IGF-1 and might be compositionally of a lesser quality. A compositional difference thus exists between the two types of milk, although the extent of this difference—namely whether conventional milk does in fact contain rbST—is still very much an open question... Under these circumstances, we conclude that composition claims like 'rbST free' are not inherently misleading."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	"Vaccines protect the “herd.” Herd immunity (or community immunity) means that when a ""critical portion"" (the percent of people who need to be vaccinated to provide herd immunity) of a population is vaccinated against a contagious disease it is unlikely that an outbreak of the disease will occur so most members of the community will be protected. [61] Children and adults who cannot be vaccinated due to age, poor health (who are immune-compromised or undergoing chemotherapy, for example), or other reasons rely on herd immunity to prevent contraction of vaccine-preventable diseases. [62] An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus' herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease. [123] In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955. [64][124] In 2005, an 18-month-old Amish girl contracted polio and spread the disease to four other unvaccinated children, but, because the community met the herd immunity threshold for the disease, there was no polio outbreak.

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""A Palestinian state of the kind proposed in the two state solution is an existential threat to the state of Israel. Furthermore, it is a historical travesty to expel half a million Jews in order to create a 23rd Arab state. Given that at least four generations of Palestinians have been raised on incitement and hatred of Israel, a weakened Israel with its pre-1967 borders would be an invitation to more war, not a guarantee for peace. Practically, there is no room for two viable states in a territory the size of New Jersey. The logic of having 80% of Israel's population living on the coastal lowlands with a Palestinian state occupying the strategic heights seems unfathomable. The two-state solution has been tried and failed many times. Israel must disabuse itself and the international community of its feasibility."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“By redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, the meaning of marriage will be changed in ways that will loosen the already-impaired link between marriage and parenting; the intergenerational connections of marriage will become attenuated. The notion that marriage is merely a private matter – a ‘common’ that should be open to all – will grow, as the public commitments and expectations of marriage erode. The chaos of sexual irresponsibility (especially infidelity and promiscuity within marriage) will grow, and the moral expectations of the basic institution of society will fade as the sexual ethic of gay and lesbian lifestyles is embraced as marriage. Instability in marriages will increase as the pattern of transitory relationships of same-sex couples is included in the social understanding of what is marriage. Sexual segregation will increase and the historically gender-integrated public institution of marriage will be redefined to include sexual apartheid couples. Instrumentalization of marriage partners will result from the inclusion of the gay lifestyle as an accepted form of the public institution of marriage. The transformative power of including gay and lesbian relationships in the public understanding of marriage will alter the institution of marriage as never before.”
01	Should Healthcare Resources Be Subject to Rationing?	"""Seven U.S. workers in 10 still get health insurance coverage as a fringe benefit of employment. But perhaps not for long. Healthcare spending gobbled up nearly $2 trillion in 2004, and it has grown about 2 1/2 percentage points a year faster than income for decades...   The truth is that sensible rationing may be the only way to make sure that fair access to healthcare for all remains affordable. The U.S. can no longer afford to offer every available service no matter how high the cost or how small the benefit to the patient. Intelligent healthcare rationing -- limiting the availability of care that costs society more to produce than it is worth to patients -- is not a horror to be avoided. It's a regretfully necessary limit to sustain fair access to healthcare that is worth what it costs.   To see the connection between rationing and affordable care for all, one must recognize that insured patients pay little of the cost of their own care when ill. So they quite understandably want everything that might conceivably add even some tiny benefit -- the extra test that provides hardly any information at all, the surgery that is little or no better than watchful waiting, or the costly patented drug that is little or no better than the inexpensive generic...   At current trends, [healthcare] will require more than one-third of the nation's output by 2030. This means we would have to double both income and payroll taxes just to maintain current levels of healthcare for the elderly, disabled and poor. Unless we squeeze out services that are worth less than they cost -- in other words, unless we ration -- even cost-effective care will become unaffordable...   Failure to ration, however, will mean that the cost of caring for the aged, disabled and poor will require astronomical tax increases -- and that working Americans will have less money to spend on anything other than healthcare. Employers will find it increasingly unattractive to sponsor coverage for workers, and workers will refuse increasingly costly coverage. What Winston Churchill said of democracy may also apply to healthcare rationing: the worst system -- except for all the others."""

And Justice, of course, means equal rights for all, regardless of whether or not we believe in a deity. The Knights of Columbus - a Catholic men's group - led the lobbying effort to add 'under God.' Now the Pledge is twisted, with divisive religious language that implies true patriots must be believers.   With 'under God' added, the Pledge is not a statement of patriotism. Instead, extremist preachers and politicians point to the language to validate their view that those who don't believe in God don't belong...

The complicity of governments sustains prostitution. When the sex trade expands, women are less likely to compete with men for jobs.

Moreover, the international marketplace determines supply and demand, so even if we reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East, a supply disruption in that region affects the quantity of U.S. imports. In fact, disruption in output anywhere - an attack on a pipeline in the Niger Delta to a hurricane in the Gulf - affects oil supplies everywhere...  We must change current assumptions by using regulations and tax policy to create incentives and provide government assistance for greener and more sustainable alternatives. Since we can't meet the country's growing need from domestic sources, we will become less secure by relying on foreign sources for substantial portions of our supplies, regardless of our drilling stance.  The Unites States needs to take the lead, or at least be one of the lead nations, in searching for energy alternatives. Our lifestyle of consumption is now creating a race for traditional resources; one we cannot win."""

Even pro-vaccine organizations state that natural vaccination causes better immunity. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that ""It is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines. Whereas immunity from disease often follows a single natural infection, immunity from vaccines occurs only after several doses."" [98] Mayo Clinic states that natural infection ""often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations."" [99] Kurt Perkins, DC, a chiropractor and wellness expert, stated, ""A vaccine violates all laws of natural immune defenses by taking a potential pathogen along with all the TOXIC ingredients (aluminum, formaldehyde, adjuvants, etc.) directly into your blood system. This process would never occur in building natural immunity. That last sentence is kind of an oxy-moron. Immunity is a natural thing. Vaccines are an artificial thing."" [100] Read More"
01	Will Increased Oil Drilling Help the US Solve Its Energy Crisis?	"""We spend almost one billion dollars every day on foreign oil. Much of it is sent to regimes that are hostile to America. That is money we should be investing here. We need to do what we can to reduce the demand we have for foreign oil and increase the energy sources that we can find here at home.  By reducing our dependence on foreign oil, we not only increase our energy - and national - security, but we also create jobs. Every new electric vehicle we produce domestically, every time we explore for new sources of natural gas or oil, we create jobs for Americans and build a stronger American economy.  After decades of dependence, it will not be easy to make the transition away from foreign oil...  Mindful of the accident in the Gulf, we promote domestic oil and gas production in order to reduce America's reliance on foreign fuels and provide necessary protections for coastal areas and marine ecosystems in the event of an accident related to oil and gas drilling activities."""
01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“My opinion on video game violence, which has a very powerful reward system wired into it, is that continued exposure desensitizes people to the experience of violence. But the other big issue, along with the reward structure, is that it teaches them a skill set that they might not otherwise develop, especially the first person shooter games. I have a real problem with giving people, in the name of entertainment, a technology that desensitizes violence, and then teaches you how to commit violence more accurately… and then elevating people’s levels of dopamine… [T]hose studies have been absolutely supported. When you put people on a PET scanner or an functional MRI, their brain lights up like a Christmas tree when they’re doing these games, especially when they hit the reward points that are designed by the gamers to… keep people gaming because that’s how these games make their money. Nothing is engaged in at the levels that I see gaming at, as a form of entertainment or dopamine elevation, unless it’s a narcotic like cocaine for instance. How could you be exposed to something this toxic and have it not affect you?”

Similarly, in Washington, the first year of legalization racked up an incredible $82 million in tax revenue. Colorado has spent the money on a number of programs aimed at improving the standards of education and health in the state. These include school construction, marijuana education, anti-bullying campaigns, public school grants, youth mentoring, drug abuse and treatment, and grants to the Future Farmers of America. All of this has been paid for by the legalization of cannabis over a year in 1 state.”

01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“Multiple lines of independent evidence confirm that human activities are the primary cause of the global warming of the past 50 years. The burning of coal, oil, and gas, and clearing of forests have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by more than 40% since the Industrial Revolution, and it has been known for almost two centuries that this carbon dioxide traps heat. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture and other human activities add to the atmospheric burden of heat-trapping gases. Data show that natural factors like the sun and volcanoes cannot have caused the warming observed over the past 50 years. Sensors on satellites have measured the sun’s output with great accuracy and found no overall increase during the past half century. Large volcanic eruptions during this period, such as Mount Pinatubo in 1991, have exerted a short-term cooling influence. In fact, if not for human activities, global climate would actually have cooled slightly over the past 50 years.”

What I do know is that war should be waged when necessary, and the Iraq War was not. Waging an unnecessary war is a grave mistake.

I have no trust at all in arguments from the pasteurized milk side of the debate; defending their side on the basis that all milk contains 'some' white blood cells and therefore the word 'pus' should not be used...

In May, 2010, a U.S. drone attack killed a popular Deputy Governor of a Yemeni province. In October of last year, two weeks after Obama successfully ordered the death of U.S. citizen Anwar Awlaki, a U.S. drone strike killed his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman… It’s not hard to imagine what ordinary Yemenis think of the U.S., and whether they’d be more sympathetic to Al Qaeda’s message after all of this.”
01	Lowering the Voting Age - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Lowering the voting age to 16 increases voter turnout and develops lifelong voting habits. The United States has one of the lowest voter turnout rates among developed countries. [18] A person who votes in one election has a 13% greater probability of voting in a future election. [19] Researchers say that people who participate in elections when they first reach voting age are likely to develop the habit of voting, and those who don't are more likely to remain nonvoters. [20][21] 16-year-olds are learning about government and civics in high school, and the structured environment would lead to higher turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds as teachers and parents help them overcome typical obstacles for first-time voters, such as the registration process and finding their polling places. [9][22][23] By contrast, many 18-year-olds are in a time of transition, making them less likely to participate in elections. [21][23] Involving young people in voting can have a ""trickle up"" effect that mobilizes their parents and other adults in their households to vote, increasing the overall voter turnout rate.

What about the parents of the kids who are taking steroids? What would do more good for our children, our schools and our neighborhoods is to clean up the behavior of parents.  I am no expert on the process of obtaining anabolic steroids. I seriously doubt, however, that a 13-year-old student athlete has the ability to walk down to the corner drugstore and obtain steroids. For that matter, are we really to believe that just because a professional athlete admits to taking steroids, student athletes across the country are automatically going to have the desire to take steroids? This is an absurd concept. The parents of student athletes who take steroids must play a major role in this process, from encouraging use to procuring the drugs.  If Major League Baseball and other professional sports are serious about addressing the steroid issue for the sake of children, as they have professed, they must be willing to address the behavior and involvement of overzealous parents.

In Jan. 1998, Public Agenda found that 66% of college professors said ""elementary and high schools expect students to learn too little.” By Mar. 2002, after a surge in testing and the passing of NCLB, that figure dropped to 47% ""in direct support of higher expectations, strengthened standards and better tests.” [34] [108] Read More"
10	Would Repealing the 1945 Antitrust Exemption for Health Insurance Companies Lower Premiums? - DEBATED	"""Lawmakers are expected to pass a bill this week [Feb. 2010] that would repeal the federal antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed since 1945 -- a move that makes for little more than a good sound bite...  Removing the exemption won't do much to boost competition or spark a price war among insurers, however... The unfortunate reality in healthcare reform is that there is no quick fix to reducing premiums or even bringing their growth into line with inflation. The ever-increasing cost of insurance reflects the incessant growth in healthcare spending. And the solution is to reduce the supply of money for healthcare, lower the demand for medical services, or do both."""

01	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""Ending birthright citizenship would result in a flood of newly created stateless children. In the United States, that would quickly become a humanitarian crisis…   Around the world—in countries such as Estonia, Burma, Thailand, Côte d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, and many others—some 10 million people are stateless, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. They lack citizenship in the country where they were born, and they have nowhere to go where they can receive legal status. Stateless individuals cannot participate in any political process anywhere. They’re often subject to arbitrary detention. They have limited access to health care and education. They are especially vulnerable to crime and have little legal recourse if they are victimized. They have no economic rights and few job prospects. In extreme cases, as with the Rohingya Muslims of Burma and the Hill Tribe population of Thailand, they’re exposed to increased rates of human trafficking… Without birthright citizenship, the descendants of some undocumented immigrants could be stateless for generations to come."""
01	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""The ACA imposes several burdensome regulations that could potentially harm job and wage growth, including the employer mandate and requirements on the generosity of coverage. Under the ACA, employers with 50 or more full-time employees are required to provide health insurance for their workers or pay a fine. In addition, the ACA enforces rules that govern the type of insurance plans they can provide and restricts their options in choosing low-cost coverage. When employers are required to provide health insurance and their low-cost options are limited, costs will naturally rise and companies will be more responsive to changes in insurance premiums. As a result, employees are less insulated from insurance premium growth, and if premiums rise considerably under the ACA, then employers could be more likely to offset those costs by cutting jobs or wages."""
10	Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""[T]he displacement of existing agricultural production, due to biofuel demand, is accelerating land-use change and, if left unchecked, will reduce biodiversity and may even cause greenhouse gas emissions rather than savings...  Although there are high levels of uncertainty in the data, the science and in the modelling of the indirect effects of biofuels, the balance of evidence shows a significant risk that current policies will lead to net greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity through habitat destruction. This includes effects arising from the conversion of grassland for cropland."""

American consumers will have access to hydrogen energy to the same extent that they have access to gasoline, natural gas, and electricity today. It will be produced cleanly, with near-zero net carbon emissions, and it will be transported and used safely. It will be the 'fuel of choice' for American businesses and consumers...  Hydrogen will be available for every end-use energy need in the economy, including transportation, power generation, and portable power systems. Hydrogen will be the dominant fuel for government and commercial vehicle fleets. It will be used in a large number of personal vehicles and light duty trucks. It will be combusted directly and mixed with natural gas in turbines and reciprocating engines for electricity and thermal energy in homes, offices, and factories. It will be used in fuel cells for both mobile and stationary applications. And it will be used in portable devices such as computers, mobile phones, Internet hook-ups, and other electronic equipment."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The U.S. Government adopted a strong position against legalized prostitution in a December 2002 National Security Presidential Directive based on evidence that prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and fuels trafficking in persons, a form of modern-day slavery. Prostitution and related activities—including pimping and patronizing or maintaining brothels—fuel the growth of modern-day slavery by providing a façade behind which traffickers for sexual exploitation operate.   Where prostitution is legalized or tolerated, there is a greater demand for human trafficking victims and nearly always an increase in the number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery...  Few activities are as brutal and damaging to people as prostitution. Field research in nine countries concluded that 60-75 percent of women in prostitution were raped, 70-95 percent were physically assaulted, and 68 percent met the criteria for post traumatic stress disorder in the same range as treatment-seeking combat veterans and victims of state-organized torture. Beyond this shocking abuse, the public health implications of prostitution are devastating and include a myriad of serious and fatal diseases, including HIV/AIDS...  State attempts to regulate prostitution by introducing medical check-ups or licenses don’t address the core problem: the routine abuse and violence that form the prostitution experience and brutally victimize those caught in its netherworld. Prostitution leaves women and children physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually devastated. Recovery takes years, even decades—often, the damage can never be undone."""
10	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Both the Census-data driven studies and macro-level studies find that immigrants are less crime-prone than natives with some small potential exceptions. There are numerous reasons why immigrant criminality is lower than native criminality. One explanation is that immigrants who commit crimes can be deported and thus are punished more for criminal behavior, making them less likely to break the law.   Another explanation is that immigrants self-select for those willing to work rather than those willing to commit crimes. According to this 'healthy immigrant thesis,' motivated and ambitious foreigners are more likely to immigrate and those folks are less likely to be criminals. This could explain why immigrants are less likely to engage in 'anti-social' behaviors than natives despite having lower incomes. It’s also possible that more effective interior immigration enforcement is catching and deporting unlawful immigrants who are more likely to be criminals before they have a chance to be incarcerated."""

Renewable energy technologies vary widely in their technical and economic maturity, but there is a range of technologies that offer increasingly attractive options. These include wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, ocean, and hydroelectric power. Their common feature is that they produce little or no greenhouse gases, and rely on virtually inexhaustible natural sources for their 'fuel'...  We need to phase out coal and nuclear power. We cannot continue to build coal plants at a time when emissions pose a real and present danger to both ecosystems and people.

01	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""On Monday, the Affordable Care Act turned 5 years old. As a result, non-overage of pre-existing conditions that discriminated against millions of Americans, while saving billions of dollars for insurance companies – gone. The annual and lifetime monetary caps on coverage that created medical catastrophes that bankrupted thousands of families are now gone, too.   Millions of dollars spent by seniors annually because of the dreaded 'doughnut hole' in prescription coverage will soon be gone – another harmful practice ended under the ACA.   The institution of the 80-20 rule, which resulted in millions of dollars being refunded to patients because some insurance companies did not spend enough of premium dollars on actual health care is a phenomenon never seen before the ACA. Because of Obamacare, millions of Medicare recipients and private insurance patients have benefited from preventive care and cancer screenings such as colonoscopy and mammograms, free of co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses.   For all these reasons, the public has millions of reasons to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the ACA."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The analysis seems to support the hypothesis that the rape rate could be lowered if prostitution was more readily available. This would be accomplished in most countries by its legalization. In the United States where prostitution is illegal, the low-end price for most prostitutes is about $200 and the monthly per capita income is $2,820. In Amsterdam, Netherlands where prostitution is legal the price is $30. If prostitution were legalized in the United States it is rational to assume that prices would resemble those in the Netherlands, this would result in...a decrease in the rape rate of 10 per 100,000. The population of the United States if roughly 275 million so this should result is a decrease of approximately 25,000 rapes per year."""
10	Should insider trading by Congress be allowed?	"""A few thoughts:   1. Stock trading by Congressmen and their staffs presents a double-edged conflict of interest. They may vote on the basis of their trading plans or trade on the basis of their voting plans...   2. Congress has lots of access to confidential information, but one key source is its power to investigate. Do we want Congress 'investigating' companies so that members or staffers can get stock tips?   3. Congressional insider trading is a real problem... A study of trading by US Senators found that they were earning rates of returns from stock trading that would make Warren Buffet proud. The study's authors found that 'the senators also appeared to know exactly when to buy or sell their holdings. Senators would buy stocks just before the shares suddenly would outperform the market by more than 25%.' As every investor knows, you can't do that sort of thing routinely without having access to nonpublic information...   Congress often exempts itself from the laws that apply to everybody else. In most cases, we might infer that it is the laws in question that are a bad idea. In this case, however, it is the Congressional exemption that is the bad idea.

10	Is Nuclear Power Safe for Humans and the Environment?	"""Each nuclear reactor has the potential to devastate the region in which it operates. The potential for such devastation lies in the radioactive fuel that fires the nuclear power plant. The radioactive fuel rods, whether inside the reactor or in the spent fuel pool, must be cooled to prevent them from melting down.  If a meltdown were to occur in either the reactor or the spent fuel pool, the accident could kill and injure tens of thousands of people, cost billions of dollars in damages and leave large regions uninhabitable.  [T]he nuclear industry and those that purport to regulate it have down played the potential of such an accident. However, if the nuclear industry is so confident in the 'safety' of its reactors and the long-lived radioactive wastes that they produce, why must the American taxpayer indemnify the industry against the financial consequences of nuclear accident through the Price Anderson Act?  In reality, nuclear power is an inherently dangerous activity. Splitting atoms is the most complicated and dangerous way to produce electricity...  The public should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the mere fact that the U.S. nuclear power industry has not melted down a reactor since Three Mile Island. Operating without a meltdown for a finite period of time does not mean that safety is adequate...  The United States can avoid the next nuclear accident by phasing out the remaining 103 commercial nuclear reactors."""

The death penalty is too costly, the possibility is high that a person who has been wrongfully convicted will be put to death, capital punishment inordinately affects communities of color, the imposition of the death penalty varies greatly from county to county, a low income defendant faces a troubling disadvantage when charged with a capital offense, the death penalty forecloses any possibility of healing and redemption, the death qualification juror requirement inherently and unjustly biases the process against the defendant, and California should follow the lead of other civilized societies who have concluded that the death penalty be abolished."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In order to use labor laws to protect women in the sex industry, the legal status of prostitution and its offshoots--brothel keeping, pimping, soliciting, paying for sex--would need to be re-examined.

But whether or not we approve of sex work or would want our daughters to be thus employed, the moral argument for condemnation starts to fall apart when we consider the conditions of abuse suffered by real women working in the industry. Criminalization has been as unsuccessful in dismantling the sex industry as it has been in eliminating the drug trade and preventing back-alley abortions.  Sex work is here to stay, and by recognizing it as paid labor governments can guarantee fair treatment as well as safe and healthy work environments--including overtime and vacation pay, control over condom use, and the right to collective bargaining."""

There needs to be a paradigm shift in the way people view the conflict and ways to solve it. That involves acknowledging that Israel has created a one-state reality, and finding ways to make that state equitable rather than a vehicle for the apartheid system that exists today.  This is actually easier than with two states, because issues of separation - borders, settlements, East Jerusalem, resources - no longer become the insurmountable obstacles they currently are.

"""Global demand for liquid fuels is expected to increase from 86 MBDOE [Million Barrels per Day of Oil Equivalent] today to 116 MBDOE in 2030.These needs will be met from a variety of sources – principally oil.  The most prominent source of supply today is non-OPEC crude oil and condensate. Over the outlook period, supplies will come from areas of growth – for example, Russia, the Caspian region, and Brazil – as well as some areas of decline, reflecting the maturity of their development, such as the U.S. and the North Sea. In total, non-OPEC crude and condensate supply is likely to reflect a long plateau with a modest downturn after 2020.  Oil sands output will grow rapidly, both from mining and in-situ developments. Supplies are expected to increase from 1 MBD in 2005 to more than 4 MBD in 2030...  Making up the remainder of supplies is OPEC crude supply, which is expected to rise from about 30 MBD today to about 45 to 50 MBD by 2030. Given the sizeable resource base and the capabilities of the industry, meeting this requirement is feasible – however, access to resources and timely investments remain vital to reliable, affordable supplies."""

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Gold, a fundamental, metallic element of the earth’s constitution, exhibits unique properties that enabled it, during two millennia of market testing, to emerge as a universally accepted store of value and medium of exchange, not least because it could sustain purchasing power over the long run against a standard assortment of goods and services… To choose or to reject the true gold standard is to decide between two fundamental options: on the one hand, a free, just, stable, and objective monetary order; and on the other, manipulated, inconvertible paper money, the fundamental cause of a casino culture of speculation and crony capitalism, and the incipient financial anarchy and inequality it engenders. Restoration of a dollar convertible to gold would rebuild a necessary financial incentive for real, long-term, economic growth by encouraging saving, investment, entrepreneurial innovation, and capital allocation in productive facilities… In a free market and its banking system, grounded by the rule of convertibility to gold, new money and credit may be prudently issued only against new production or additional supply for the market, thus maintaining equilibrium between total demand and total supply.

10	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""What is absolutely incredible to me is that someone would honestly argue that we should consider the cost savings to America by killing, or assisting in the suicide, of human beings. It seems almost unfathomable. However, even if we were to consider these figures, the savings only total approximately $10,000 per assisted suicide victim. The total savings of approximately $627 million is less than one percent of the total United States health care expenditures. The reason this figure is so low is because an extremely small percentage of Americans receiving health care would qualify for physician-assisted suicide. We are not talking about the withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining procedures. This is already legal, and widely utilized. We are talking about allowing a competent adult suffering from an incurable illness with less than six months of life to seek the assistance of a physician in actively ending the patient’s life. This number makes up less than 1/3 of 1% of Americans each year, and those who do qualify, and who choose to die by assisted suicide, generally end their lives approximately three weeks before their natural death would have occurred."""

At the county level, many Americans are finding their range of insurer choice is even more constrained. For example, 58% of the nation's counties have only three or fewer insurers offering coverage in their exchange."""
01	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“There’s no mystery behind the rise of digital textbooks. I’ve heard educators heap praise on the interactive, multimedia content for its ability to engage students in new and interesting ways… Digital content also surpasses traditional textbooks by providing students with anytime, anywhere access to course material. Additionally, reading e-books lets students practice screen-specific learning and comprehension skills that will become increasingly important as society shifts even further toward digital texts, both in the classroom and in the world beyond.”

The McCarran–Ferguson Act purports to allow state governmental discrimination against inter-state commerce that would otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. It is this statute that has created the state health care oligopolies and monopolies and which is the cause of all our health care woes...  Congress has, in effect, turned the health insurance market into fifty separate state cartels, and it has allowed the states to cut off choices for citizens buying health insurance.

Unfortunately, if any one of the four machines were to be deployed in Chicago or suburban Cook County as exhibited on March 15, many voters with disabilities, particularly blind voters, would not be able to cast a ballot independently and privately.  A common refrain from the representatives from the voting machine companies when errors and omissions were found in the interface was that in an actual election 'a poll worker would help,'... Beyond turning on a voting machine and orienting a disabled user to the machine's controls, troubleshooting and problem diagnostics may be beyond the level of training and preparation of many poll workers...

10	Is Expanding Nuclear Energy Production Necessary to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""[A] zero-CO2 U.S. economy can be achieved within the next thirty to fifty years without the use of nuclear power and without acquiring carbon credits from other countries. In other words, actual physical emissions of CO2 from the energy sector can be eliminated with technologies that are now available or foreseeable...  The U.S. renewable energy resource base is vast and practically untapped. Available wind energy resources in 12 Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states equal about 2.5 times the entire electricity production of the United States. North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska each have wind energy potential greater than the electricity produced by all 103 U.S. nuclear power plants. Solar energy resources on just one percent of the area of the United States are about three times as large as wind energy, if production is focused in the high insolation areas in the Southwest and West...  Baseload power can be provided by geothermal and biomass-fueled generating stations. Intermediate loads in the evening can be powered by solar thermal power plants which have a few hours of thermal energy storage built in.  Finally, new batteries can enable plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles...  With the right combination of technologies, it is likely that even the use of coal can be phased out, along with nuclear electricity.  Complete elimination of CO2 could occur as early as 2040. Elimination of nuclear power could also occur in that time frame."""

Poor people face a variety of hardships that are addressed with existing anti-poverty measures such as food stamps, medical aid, and child assistance programs. UBI programs often use funds targeting the poor for distribution to everyone in society. According to Robert Greenstein, President of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""[i]f you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you're redistributing income upward. That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.""

[37] Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Finland, France, Italy, and the UK concludes that ""rather than reducing the overall headcount of those in poverty, a BI [basic income] would change the composition of the income-poor population"" and thus ""would not prove to be an effective tool for reducing poverty.""

The one-state idea marks a departure from the well-established premise of 'two states for two peoples,' a solution supported by a strong majority of both Israelis and Palestinians. Support for a binational state ignores the undeniable fact that Israeli and Palestinian societies are drastically different in terms of economic development, political orientation, and cultural identity—a situation which would not change with the removal of a political border. Given the two sides' history of mutual hostility and resentment, the creation of a single state will likely lead to violent ethnic conflict, a result desired by none but the most radical elements in the region.

10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""For our democracy to work well, election systems should produce the best and most convincing evidence that the announced election outcomes are correct... We have learned the hard way that almost any computer system can be broken into by a sufficiently determined, skillful, and persistent adversary. There is nothing special about voting systems that magically provides protection against attack...  Voting system software may be maliciously designed, may contain bugs, or may be changed or replaced at some point during the pre-election roll-out of equipment...  One is thus forced to the conclusion that one can not really trust voting system software very far."""
10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""Far too many states use unreliable and insecure electronic voting machines, and many states have made their situation worse by adding some forms of Internet voting for some voters, which cannot be checked for accuracy at all. Even in states where verifiable systems are used, too often the check on the voting system's function and accuracy is not done. The voting equipment now in use are aging; resources are severely impacted by the state of the economy over the past several years; shortages of both equipment and human resources are likely. After all the effort necessary to overcome the other hurdles to casting a ballot, it is patently unfair that once you get to the ballot box, that the ballot itself fails you. Taken together, these problems threaten to silently disenfranchise voters, potentially in sufficient numbers to alter outcomes."""
10	Lowering the Voting Age - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The 18-29 age group has extremely low voter turnout numbers, suggesting that people aren't ready to vote until later in life. Only 12.5% of 18-year-olds participated in the 2014 midterm election, compared to 42% of the general population. [27] According to the United States Elections Project's analysis of US Census Bureau data, just 16% of eligible voters ages 18-29 voted in the 2014 election, compared to 30% for ages 30-44, 43% for 45-59, and 55% for age 60 and up. [28][29] Over the last 30 years, voter turnout for 18- to 29-year-olds has never exceeded 21% in a midterm election. [29][30] Only 23% of students scored at or above the ""proficient"" level on the last National Assessment of Educational Progress test of civics knowledge and skills. [31] David Davenport, research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said, ""My concern is if 16-year-olds were allowed to vote on any kind of broad scale, what we'd actually be doing is bringing the least politically informed, the least politically experienced, the least mature in terms of making long-term judgments and trade-offs, directly into and potentially affecting our voter turnout and results.""

10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	now, doctors cannot prescribe marijuana, because the FDA has never approved cannabis to treat any medical conditions… Cannabis’s general uselessness as medicine shouldn’t surprise anyone who thinks through the issue.

10	"Do Undocumented Immigrants Pay Their ""Fair Share"" of Taxes?"	"""While it is empirically true that illegal immigrants are hard working, the presumption that they pay their fair share of taxes is not as visibly verifiable or probable...   Although illegal immigrants pay billions of dollars in Social Security taxes, Social Security taxes are not the main source of revenue for state and federal government—income taxes are...[W]hile illegal immigrant workers have less opportunity to avoid Social Security tax withholdings, they do have opportunity and motivation to avoid income tax withholdings.   So, even if an illegal immigrant worker, who in order to reduce tax withholdings had claimed exemptions for dependents living in Mexico, decided to file tax returns, he or she would likely have a larger tax liability than expected. What are the odds that he or she would come up with the money to pay the additional tax bill after the IRS denied the non-qualifying exemptions? And, if the illegal alien falsely claimed that the dependents did live in the U.S., he or she would still be evading his or her fair share of taxes...   By evading taxes, benefiting from taxpayer provided services, and undermining the wage scale of legal workers, it is highly unlikely that illegal immigrants are a net benefit to most Americans."""

When defense spending is included, their costs are only 46 percent those of other households. However, they pay only 28 percent as much in taxes as non-illegal households. As a result, the estimated net cost per illegal household was $2,736. Whether one sees this fiscal deficit as resulting from low tax payments or heavy use of services is a matter of perspective. As already discussed, illegal households comprise 3.6 percent of the total population, but...they account for an estimated 0.9 percent of taxes paid and 1.4 percent of costs."""

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	"Marriage is for procreation and should not be extended to same-sex couples because they cannot produce children together. Allowing gay marriage would only further shift the purpose of marriage from producing and raising children to adult gratification. [19] A California Supreme Court ruling from 1859 stated that ""the first purpose of matrimony, by the laws of nature and society, is procreation."" [90] Nobel Prize-winning philosopher Bertrand Russell stated that ""it is through children alone that sexual relations become important to society, and worthy to be taken cognizance of by a legal institution."" [91] Court papers filed in July 2014 by attorneys defending Arizona's gay marriage ban stated that ""the State regulates marriage for the primary purpose of channeling potentially procreative sexual relationships into enduring unions for the sake of joining children to both their mother and their father... Same-sex couples can never provide a child with both her biological mother and her biological father."" Contrary to the pro gay marriage argument that some different-sex couples cannot have children or don't want them, even in those cases there is still the potential to produce children. Seemingly infertile heterosexual couples sometimes produce children, and medical advances may allow others to procreate in the future. Heterosexual couples who do not wish to have children are still biologically capable of having them, and may change their minds. [98] Read More"

10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Whether we like to admit it or not, social media, in all its forms, has taken a toll on our relationships – particularly our friendships… Social media makes us feel like we know people better than we really do. Let’s get one thing straight: Liking someone’s photos on Instagram does not a friendship make. Genuine relationships take time and communication—preferably face-to-face… Social media misleads us to believe that we have a large, built-in support system. But that support system is merely a number, not real life… The only real way to foster community is to live life with people over time… Social media puts up virtual walls. Most of the time, we don’t air our dirty laundry online for fear of what others might think. We only Instagram our best moments and tweet about the most extraordinary few minutes of our day… Yet, it’s only in our mess, in our brokenness, when we can become fully known. The friends who know us best are those who have seen us at our worst—and loved us any way. Those types of friendships are only crafted through the nitty gritty life moments that we’d all be too embarrassed to divulge on Facebook… We’ve become so obsessed with making sure the story we’re telling on social media looks exciting and beautiful and meaningful that we’ve failed to pay adequate attention to the stories other people are telling. It’s easy for us to be me-focused when social media forces us to play the part. How can we ever be a good friend when we have no room for another person in our carefully crafted lives?”

01	Does the Regular Smoking of Marijuana Cause Lung Cancer or in Any Way Permanently Injure the Lungs?	Cannabis cigarettes a day are associated with the same evidence of acute and chronic bronchitis and the same degree of damage to the bronchial mucosa as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day. Cannabis smoking is likely to weaken the immune system. Infections of the lung are due to a combination of smoking-related damage to the cells lining the bronchial passage and impairment of the principal immune cells in the small air sacs caused by cannabis. The evidence concerning a possible link between cannabis smoking and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has not yet been conclusively established. A number of studies indicate a causal relationship between the two whereas others contradict these findings. Research linking cannabis smoking to the development of respiratory cancer exists although there have also been conflicting findings. Not only does the tar in a cannabis cigarette contain many of the same known carcinogens as tobacco smoke but the concentrations of these are up to 50% higher in the smoke of a cannabis cigarette. It also deposits four times as much tar on the respiratory tract as an unfiltered cigarette of the same weight. Smokers of cannabis and tobacco have shown a greater increase in cellular abnormalities indicating a cumulative effect of smoking both. The THC in cannabis has been shown to have a short term bronchodilator effect. This has lead to suggestions that THC may have therapeutic benefits in asthma. However, the noxious gases, chronic airway irritation or malignancy after long term use associated with smoking would seem likely to negate these benefits.”
10	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“[M]any governments have taken to mandating a whole host of vaccines, including vaccines for non-lethal diseases. Sometimes these vaccine mandates have run amok as when the government mandated a rotavirus vaccine that was later recalled because it was causing intestinal blockage in children. I’m not a fan of government coercion, yet, given the choice, I do believe the benefits of most vaccines vastly outweigh the risks… Each year, before that year’s flu strain is known, the scientists put their best guess into that year’s vaccine. Some years it’s completely wrong. We vaccinate for the wrong strand, the wrong strain of flu vaccine. Yet five states already mandate flu vaccines. Is it really appropriate to mandate a vaccine that more often than not vaccinates for the wrong flu strain? As we contemplate forcing parents to choose this or that vaccine, I think it’s important to remember that force is not consistent with the American story, nor is force consistent with the liberty our forefathers sought when they came to America. I don’t think you have to have one or the other, though. I’m not here to say don’t vaccinate your kids. If this hearing is for persuasion I’m all for the persuasion. I vaccinated myself and I vaccinated my kids. For myself and my children I believe that the benefits of vaccines greatly outweigh the risks, but I still don’t favor giving up on liberty for a false sense of security.”
01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“[C]ompletely eliminating meat and animal products reaps the greatest health benefits. Although different meats have varying amounts of fat, they all contain about the same amount of cholesterol. In addition, diets high in animal protein are associated with high blood cholesterol, thereby raising the risk of heart disease… All animal products contain considerably more concentrated levels of pesticide residue than either vegetables or grains. Like red meat, poultry and fish contain no beneficial carbohydrates, fiber, or phytochemicals… Fish contain substantially more heavy metals (such as lead, mercury, and cadmium) and industrial pollutants (such PCBs, DDT and dioxins) than land animals… In the United States alone, about 10 billion animals are killed each year to be turned into meat. This translates into about 34 animals per person that are needlessly killed each year to appease the human appetite… Conditions on factory farms and at slaughterhouses are deplorable. Most farm animals live in cramped, filthy quarters that do not allow for even the most basic needs such as fresh air, sunshine, sanitary conditions, unrestrained movement, natural mating, suckling offspring, or developing normal social behaviors… There is a common misconception that a vegetarians have a limited array of food choices. Just the opposite is true. Vegetarians commonly eat a wider variety of foods than most meat eaters.”

Georgia voters have overwhelmingly indicated their approval of electronic voting in not one but two independent public opinion studies."""
10	Has DNA Testing Led to Significant Improvements in the Criminal Justice System?	"""The DNA testing and evidence only occurs in a situation where the assailant leaves biological evidence behind. For the most part, we are talking about rape cases where there is semen left that can be tested. There are occasionally non-rape cases where the assailant may have left behind hair fragments or fingernail fragments that are of a sufficient quantity that they can be tested for DNA. But if no biological evidence is left behind, which is what occurs in most cases in the criminal justice system, no DNA testing can occur. The second qualifier is: even among those cases where there is biological evidence left behind that can be tested, if it is not gathered and collected and preserved properly, you will end up with a false test.   So I think the possibilities with DNA testing are immense in terms of being able to exonerate certain people, or on the other hand, definitively indicate that they were the perpetrator. But it still will not be available in somewhere between 70 and 75 percent of the cases in the criminal justice system, perhaps even more. So it is not the silver bullet that is going to solve our criminal justice system problems."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""[A]lternative energy sources have some way to go before they can make substantial contributions to the world's future energy mix, given the current state of their development and the various hurdles they still face. We must also remember that many of these alternatives, such as nuclear or renewables, or even conventional sources such as coal, may be able to meet additional demand in power generation and possibly industry but not in transportation, which of course is a key sector of oil utilization.  Alternatives and their contributions to meeting steadily rising energy demand are needed and welcome, and eventually these fuel sources will become a more important component of global energy supplies. But we must be realistic about the pace of their future development, and understand that for the foreseeable future, their significance in the energy supply mix will continue to be limited."""

01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“Ronald Reagan was a great communicator not because he said things in an unusual way but because he said great things – things that were true and needed saying. Those on the left in his day always thought Reagan had some magical way of expressing himself. He didn’t. It was what he said that was important, not how he said it… Reagan brought a constellation of virtues to the office of the presidency – guts, compassion, humor, a lack of pretension, a willingness to face the world and tell the truth, a willingness to make decisions and stand by them – and his leadership changed the world, and for the better. As president, he was a giant.”
10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	"Animal testing is cruel and inhumane.

I was in Washington as a visiting fellow at a think tank for the first six weeks of the year before having to leave suddenly to take advantage of a fleeting opportunity to get into Iraq before the start of the war.

10	Is It Misleading to Label Milk as Free of the Artificial Growth Hormone rBST/rBGH?	"""Several large dairy producers and food companies have made news recently by getting rid of recombinant bovine growth hormone, also known as rBGH or rBST, from their milk supply. This is great news for consumers, since this genetically engineered growth hormone is known to cause harm to cows and may pose health risks to humans.  In yet another attack on consumers' right to know, Monsanto, the company that makes rBGH under the trade name Posilac, has asked the Food and Drug Administration to restrict the use of labels identifying 'rBGH-free' or 'rBST-free' dairy products. Monsanto claims such labels are 'misleading' to consumers, and infer that dairy products without such a label are inferior. FDA approved the use of voluntary labels more than 12 years ago at the request of dairy companies seeking to respond to customer concerns over the use of the genetically engineered hormone. Since FDA refused to require mandatory labeling of dairy products from cows treated with rBGH, voluntary labeling by non-adopters is the only label consumers can count on to make informed decisions about what to feed themselves and their families.  If Monsanto succeeds in convincing FDA to restrict rBGH-free labeling, consumers will lose valuable information about how their food is produced."""

Capital defendants are often provided with inadequate legal counsel, resulting in unfair and inequitable trials. The death penalty disproportionately impacts the poor and people of color. There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime. A significant danger exists that innocent people have been and will be executed because of errors in the criminal justice system."""

10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""First and foremost, [illegal immigration] it's a source of value added. The total goods and services that they consume through their paycheck, plus all that they produce for their employers, is close to about $800 billion. They're also producing at relatively lower costs because the undocumented population typically gets about 20% less in wages than if they were legalized. That leads to lower prices for us and higher profits to employers. In addition, they're obviously a huge consumer base. We've seen that 90% of the wages that the undocumented population gets are spent inside the U.S. Remittances are sent abroad, but that only represents about 10% of immigrants' income. The numbers are becoming quite huge. We estimate about $50 billion dollars in remittances this year. That means that total consumptive capacity remaining in the U.S. is $400 billion to $450 billion. If you took away the undocumented population, it would be the worst economic disaster in the history of the U.S."""

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Without the ability to use animals in their research, scientists’ efforts would be massively hampered, not only in the direct development of new treatments, but also in the fundamental research which underpins all biomedical knowledge. For example, it was Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley’s work on the nerves of squid that elucidated the basis of nervous transmission; and it was John C Eccles’ work on cats’ spinal cords that first incontrovertibly demonstrated the nature of the synapse, earning him a share of the 1963 Nobel in Physiology, along with Hodgkin and Huxley. Without their work on animals, we would know far less about the workings of our own nervous systems and how to treat them… [R]esearchers have devised many routes of minimizing inter-species variation, such as the use of transgenic animals – genetically altered to replicate human physiology more closely. This has additional benefits, including shorter generation-span, allowing scientists to perform experiments which simply would not be possible using humans (even ignoring ethical concerns)… Claiming that microfluidics and microdosing can analyze drug effects on a full living system is absurd. How can a fluid-based chip replicate the most basic heart, let alone a human one? Microdosing can be useful for studying uptake mechanisms of a drug, but gives extremely limited information on its efficacy at treating a condition. ‘Alternatives’ are already widely used in research, but expecting them to replace animal tests in the near future is hugely naïve.”
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“God designed marriage for humanity. As first described in Genesis and later affirmed by Jesus, marriage is a God-ordained, covenant relationship between a man and a woman. This lifelong, sexually exclusive relationship brings children into the world and thus sustains the stewardship of the earth. Biblical marriage —­­ marked by faithfulness, sacrificial love and joy — displays the relationship between God and his people… Nothing in the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges opinion changes the truth about marriage. What has changed is the legal definition of marriage, which is now at variance with orthodox biblical faith as it has been affirmed across the centuries and as it is embraced today by nearly two billion Christians in every nation on earth. In its role as a moral teacher, the law now misleads Americans about the true nature of marriage. Evangelicals and other followers of the Bible have a heightened opportunity to demonstrate the attractiveness of loving Christian marriages and families. Evangelicals should renew their commitment to the sacrificial love and covenantal faithfulness to which Jesus calls all husbands and wives.”
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	"Tenure makes it difficult to remove under-performing teachers because the process involves months of legal wrangling by the principal, the school board, the union, and the courts.

[2] [4] A 2018 survey by the New York State School Boards Association found that over one-third of school districts declined to pursue dismissal of poorly performing tenured teachers because of the costly and ""cumbersome"" process. [54] In a study of 25 school districts, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute found that it can take between one and six years to remove an experienced tenured teacher, concluding that, ""the line from dismal performance to dismissal has hardly been streamlined.

Officers governed by a §287 (g) agreement must receive adequate training and operate under the direction of federal authorities.

"""The suggestion has been made, however, that the requirement of a paper record to be used for a manual audit can be satisfied by a paper record of votes that is produced for the time after the polls have closed - that is, a printout of what the computer has stored, and that has never been seen by the voter. This interpretation... would make the requirement for a 'manual audit capacity' virtually meaningless.  A paper record consisting solely of ballots printed by the computer after the closing of the polls - and therefore never seen by the voters - would mean that a manual audit or recount would simply amount to reviewing what was stored in the computer. The audit or recount could not manually verify that the computer had accurately recorded the voter's intent, or had accurately stored that information, or had accurately printed out that information. Both an audit and a recount, therefore, would miss the key element of the system - whether the voter's intention had been accurately recorded...  An audit using a record of votes printed post-closing, of course, could not be considered a manual audit of the complete voting system - it would be a partial audit, at best, limited to the math performed by the computer. It would not be an audit of whether the voters' intent was accurately recorded by the computer - and that is the critical issue."""
01	Has Obamacare Improved Medicare? - DEBATED	"""New protections and benefits in the health care law strengthen Medicare, protecting the benefits you've earned and providing more care from your coverage...  The health care law protects the benefits you were promised to ensure you can always get the care you need when you need it.

10	Is Obamacare a Socialist Law? - DEBATED	"""Myth 4: Obamacare is a socialist program. (FALSE)  Reality: Socialism is a system under which the government directly runs a nation's industries. Under this standard, New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority could, arguably, be considered socialist. After all, they represented instances in which the government directly employed people to build and administer power plants and other public works that generated income. Obamacare, on the other hand, will work through private companies. Rather than directly providing health insurance, either through a national program or through some sort of public option, the government will require that people deal with private insurers. Far from competing with private industry, the health care law will likely give it a lot of new customers."""
10	Should the United States Authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline to Import Tar Sand Oil from Canada?	"""I rise in very strong opposition to the legislation on the floor and to the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline...   First and foremost, at a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity and carbon emissions, that it is already causing devastating problems not only in the United States but all over the world in terms of drought, forest fires, flooding, extreme weather disturbances, and rising sea levels, at this moment when the scientific community is so clear about the dangers inherent upon a further dependence on fossil fuels, it is absolutely imperative for the future wellbeing of this country that we listen to the scientists and we begin the path forward to break our dependency on fossil fuel, not accelerate more drilling for the dirtiest oil on the planet...   The Keystone XL Pipeline would move us exactly in the wrong direction. More dependence not only on fossil fuels but on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels imaginable - the dirtiest fossil fuels imaginable. That is crazy. To reject what the scientific community is telling us and then to add insult to injury by going forward aggressively and accelerating the drilling of dirty oil is something that is almost beyond comprehension...   Furthermore, when people talk about this being a jobs program, let's understand that there is no debate that what we are talking about are less than 50 permanent jobs - less than 50 permanent jobs. So to suggest this is some kind of big jobs program is nothing more than a cruel hoax and a misleading hoax to workers in this country who need decent-paying jobs."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“The poisonous essence of this law [NCLB] lies in the mania of obsessive testing it has forced upon our nation’s schools and, in the case of underfunded, overcrowded inner-city schools, the miserable drill-and-kill curriculum of robotic ‘teaching to the test’ it has imposed on teachers, the best of whom are fleeing from these schools because they know that this debased curriculum would never have been tolerated in the good suburban schools that they, themselves, attended. …There are some mediocre teachers in our schools (there are mediocre lawyers, mediocre senators, and mediocre presidents as well), but hopelessly dull and unimaginative teachers do not suddenly turn into classroom wizards under a regimen that transforms their classrooms into test-prep factories.”

Any civil-liberties restrictions imposed may be with us for a very long time… The war on terror is also a war of ideas if we are really serious about preventing further attacks, it is not enough to become better spies… Americans question whether the new anti-terrorism laws are upsetting the system of checks and balances that are fundamental to our democracy, they are fulfilling a civic responsibility. And when others decry the detention of hundreds of immigrants for reasons that have nothing to do with the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they are performing a necessary task.”

And, that was the golden period of the gold standard… I’m known as a ‘gold bug’ and everyone laughs at me, but, why do central banks own gold now?”
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	Diseases and medical conditions are more likely to be treated when consumers see DTC prescription drug ads. According to a 2004 FDA survey, 88% of the physicians who had patients ask about drugs seen in DTC ads reported that the patients had the conditions the drugs treat and were thus able to get treatment. [43] For example, Procrit is a drug used to counteract anemia and can be used to help chemotherapy patients with fatigue. Prior to an ad campaign for the drug, it was rarely prescribed because chemotherapy patients were not reporting fatigue caused by the chemotherapy to their doctors. After seeing the ad, however, patients reported fatigue and could be appropriately diagnosed. [46] In 2007 the FDA approved a drug for fibromyalgia, a condition that previously had no drug treatment, so patients with the condition were made aware of a possible treatment through DTC prescription drug ads and could speak to their doctors in order to receive treatment.

01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“You don’t know unless you measure. Listen, I’ve heard every excuse in the book about measurement. You know, ‘You’re testing too much.’ ‘You’re teaching the test.’ And, you know, ‘Don’t test.’ If you don’t test, you have a system that just shuffles the kids through, and that’s unacceptable. It’s unacceptable to quit on a kid early and just say, ‘Move through, and hope you learn.’ What you’ve got to do is measure to determine where they are, and then you can compare districts and compare States. And as a result of strong accountability measures and good teachers and more funding, the results are positive. The fourth grade math test scores around the Nation are up 9 points since 2000. In other words, we’re beginning to achieve—meet national objectives, which is a more literate group of students. The reading—eighth grade math scores are up 5 points. Fourth graders are now testing above—reading tests are increasing for fourth graders. We’re making a difference.”

01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“The truth is I’m not at all indifferent to the fate of marriage as a whole, but I cannot for the life of me see what terrible damage same-sex marriage would actually do to it. Would it accelerate divorce rates? I cannot see how. The only country with anything like comparable legal protections for gay couples, Denmark, has actually seen lower divorce rates among same-sex couples than among heterosexual ones. In many ways, I think, the inclusion of more people into the institution might actually have the opposite effect, sending a message about matrimonial responsibility and mutual caring to the entire society, rather than to merely 97 percent of it. Would it harm children? Why on earth should it? Are the kids of a heterosexual family going to be harmed by meeting other kids who are the legitimate children of a gay couple down the street?… Here are a few of the advantages of same-sex marriage for the society as a whole that I have laboriously spelled out: lower rates of promiscuity among gay men, more stable homes for the children of gay parents, less trauma in families with gay offspring, lower rates of disease transmission, more independent and self-reliant members of society, etc., etc. These aren’t appeals to sympathy; they’re arguments that same-sex marriage would be good for all of us – and for conservative reasons to boot.”

10	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""Nearly all hydrogen in use today is, itself, being 'produced' by stripping hydrogen from natural gas through steam reformation of methane. There is no technical advantage to reforming methane in preference to electrolysis of water, there is only a price advantage of about a factor of two...  Any serious attempt at a hydrogen economy would promptly overwhelm methane resources and necessarily have to be supplied with electricity-derived hydrogen. And, of course, hydrogen use ends with electricity coming out of a fuel cell. So, hydrogen use is really a loop that starts and ends with electricity. Unfortunately, the efficiency of that electricity to hydrogen to electricity loop is only twenty-five percent... The result is that for every four power plants making electricity, only one plant's electrical output actually ends up being productively used. Three power plants' output is lost simply because hydrogen was part of the process...  There are significant challenges to a hydrogen energy-carrying scheme including materials development, tremendous cost barriers, infrastructure inadequacies and the very low conversion efficiency. While many of hydrogen's problems could presumably be reduced with enough time and effort, the fact remains that the twenty five percent efficiency problem of the electricity to hydrogen to electricity loop is unsolvable. That kind of waste is simply unworkable in a world that is facing the energy-related challenges our's is facing. Societies around this planet will be struggling this century and beyond just to afford to replace their existing GHG-belching stationary sources with clean, non-GHG sources like nuclear, wind, low-head hydro and solar. There certainly will not be an overabundance of clean energy to squander on an inefficient hydrogen loop, particularly when the same tasks can be accomplished directly with the original electricity."""

01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“The contributions of animal research to medical science and human health are undeniable… When the majority of scientists see the work as scientifically justified, and so do the many professional medical and scientific organizations, the expert views cannot be simply dismissed based on wild claims of ulterior motives, self-interest and conspiracy theories. Why is the use of animals in scientific experimentation morally permissible? In my view, it is because the moral status of animals is not equal to that of humans and because opting out of the research condemns our patients (both animal and human) to suffer and die of disease. Stopping the research would be, as Darwin correctly judged, a crime against humanity. I have come to appreciate the compassion animal activists have toward animals. Paradoxically, this compassion does not seem to extent to human patients. Hopefully, animal activists will come to accept that our work is driven similarly by an honest attempt at advancing knowledge and alleviating suffering and disease in the world.”

01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Return the drinking age to 18 — and then enforce the law. The current system, which forbids alcohol to Americans under 21, is widely flouted, with disastrous consequences. Teaching people to drink responsibly before they turn 21 would enormously enhance public health. Now, high school and college kids view dangerous binge drinking as a rite of passage. The current law, passed in all 50 states in the 1980s, was intended to diminish the number of traffic deaths caused by young drunk drivers. It has succeeded in that — but tougher seatbelt and D.U.I. rules have contributed to the decrease, too. Raising the drinking age hasn’t reduced drinking — it’s merely driven it underground, to the riskiest of settings: unsupervised high school blowouts and fraternity parties that make ‘Animal House’ look quaint. This age segregation leads the drinking away from adults, who could model moderation.”

01	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""[T]he allegation that flavored milk contributes to obesity is factually incorrect. The opposite is actually the case: milk drinkers, even those that consume flavored milk, tend to weigh less, not more. According to a study published in 2008 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, kids who drank milk were less likely to be overweight. This finding holds true no matter which flavor of milk kids consumed.   Schools that have removed flavored milk have seen a sharp decline in milk consumption, which is bad news for kids' nutrition since milk contains nine essential nutrients and three nutrients that American children tend to under-consume: calcium, potassium and vitamin D... total milk consumption dropped an average of 35 percent when flavored milk was eliminated. Consumption dropped because fewer students were selecting milk and more milk was thrown away…   Some argue that the nutrients lost when kids stop drinking milk can be replaced by other food sources. But to replace all the nutrients from one serving of flavored milk, schools would need to provide two ounces of cheese, one medium egg, one cup of fortified orange juice and a half cantaloupe over the course of a week. That adds up to a lot of extra calories and cost!   Eliminating excess sugar from kids' diets is a worthwhile goal. The added sugar in flavored milk is miniscule (less than 3% of a kid's daily sugar intake). We need to place the focus on what makes the most difference to a child's overall health. Flavored milk offers a practical way of ensuring that kids get all the nutrients they need, even if it takes a few more grams of sugar to do it."""

We should require illegal immigrants to register with the government to ensure they are paying taxes, learning English, undergoing background checks, and paying restitution for entering our nation illegally. Then, after living under our laws and our rules, we should require they wait for citizenship behind legal immigrants already in line. Finally, after going through this lengthy process -- including paying fines, paying taxes, learning English, and passing an American civics and assimilation exam -- which should take a decade or longer, an illegal immigrant could become a citizen, rather than remaining in the shadows and outside the arm of the law. Most important, we need presidential leadership on this issue to build consensus and craft solutions through constitutional means, not executive fiat."""

10	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""Reasons why Cap and Trade is a Bad Idea:  Cap and trade is designed to increase the price of 85 percent of the energy we use in the United States. That is the point. For it to 'work,' cap and trade needs to increase the price of oil, coal, and natural gas to force consumers to use more expensive forms of energy...  Cap and trade schemes for carbon dioxide have not worked to reduce emissions. Europe's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) began in 2005. The first phase, from 2005 to 2007, did not reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Instead, overall emissions increased 1.9 percent over that period...  Cap and trade will assess a heavy penalty on Canadian oil. Much of the oil we get comes from its vast reserves of oil sands. Because it requires more energy to extract the resources from those sands than it does to produce oil in the Middle East, cap and trade will make Canadian oil more expensive than oil from the Middle East.  Cap and trade, therefore, creates incentives to import more oil from the Middle East, not less. Cap and trade also penalizes domestic oil extraction from oil shale."""

States that put in place a single-payer health system will surpass the coverage of federal law. A single-payer health system, improved Medicare for all, would be universal and would provide the necessary cost controls and savings that would fund comprehensive coverage, including much-needed mental health, dental and vision care.

[57] Reuters reported that of the 500 ""militants"" the CIA believed it had killed with drones between 2008 and 2010, only 14 were ""top-tier militant targets,"" and 25 were ""mid-to-high-level organizers"" of al Qaeda, the Taliban, or other hostile groups. [59] The CIA had killed around 12 times more low-level fighters than mid-to-high-level during that same period.

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	"Gay marriage is contrary to the word of God and is incompatible with the beliefs, sacred texts, and traditions of many religious groups. The Bible, in Leviticus 18:22, states: ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination,"" thus condemning homosexual relationships. [120] In Islamic tradition, several hadiths (passages attributed to the Prophet Muhammad) condemn gay and lesbian relationships, including the sayings ""When a man mounts another man, the throne of God shakes,"" and ""Sihaq [lesbian sex] of women is zina [illegitimate sexual intercourse]."" [121] The Catholic Church, United Methodist Church, Southern Baptist Convention, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, National Association of Evangelicals, and American Baptist Churches USA all oppose same-sex marriage. [119] Two orthodox Jewish groups, the Orthodox Agudath Israel of America and the Orthodox Union, also oppose gay marriage, as does mainstream Islam. [13] [119] According to a July 31, 2003 statement from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope John Paul II, marriage ""was established by the Creator with its own nature, essential properties and purpose. No ideology can erase from the human spirit the certainty that marriage exists solely between a man and a woman…"" [54] Pope Benedict stated in Jan. 2012 that gay marriage threatened ""the future of humanity itself.""

01	Does Obamacare Make Any Changes to Physician Payments through Medicare/Medicaid? – YES	"""Obamacare does not substantially change the general pattern of the government's systems of physician payment but instead expands their reach and adds new regulatory restrictions. For example, beginning in 2010, the new law, with few exceptions, will prohibit physicians from referring Medicare patients to hospitals in which they have ownership.  In 2011, Medicare primary care physicians and general surgeons practicing in 'shortage' areas will receive a 10 percent bonus payment. And primary care physicians participating in Medicaid will get no less than 100 percent of the Medicare payment rates for their services for 2013 and 2014, with the federal taxpayer making up the difference between Medicaid funding and the higher Medicare payment rates. But there is a catch: There is no provision for continued federal taxpayer funding beyond these two years, so states will have to either increase their own Medicaid expenditures substantially or cut back their Medicaid physician payments...  On top of existing payment rules, regulations, and guidelines, the new law creates numerous new federal agencies, boards, and commissions. There are three that have direct relevance to physicians and the practice of medicine:  1. Under section 6301, Obamacare creates a 'non-profit' Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. It will be financed through a trust fund, with initial funding starting at $10 million this year and reaching $150 million annually in fiscal year 2013, with additional revenues from insurance fees. In effect, the institute will be examining clinical effectiveness of medical treatments, procedures, drugs, and medical devices. Much will depend upon how the findings and recommendations will be implemented and any financial incentives, penalties, or regulatory requirements.  2. Under section 3403, there will be an Independent Payment Advisory Board in 2012, with 15 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The board would aim to reduce the per capita growth rate in Medicare spending in accordance with specified targets (based initially on measures of inflation and eventually GDP growth) and make recommendations for slowing growth in non-federal health programs. The board's recommendations would go into effect unless Congress enacts an alternative proposal. An unprecedented cap on Medicare spending, the process would doubtless reduce Medicare physician payment.  3. Under section 3002, the law extends the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative. While it provides incentives for the quality of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries, the program is nonetheless burdened with time-consuming compliance and reporting requirements."""
01	Is Prosecutorial Misconduct a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""Keeping blacks off death penalty juries is a common form of official misconduct. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the death sentence of Jimmy Lee Horton in September of 1991, it censured the District Attorney of the case. In a succession of death penalty cases he had used his preemptory strikes to keep blacks off the juries of black defendants. He even instructed the county clerk how to under-represent blacks and women in the jury pool and not get caught...  Some people are sentenced to death on the basis of untrustworthy testimony from jailhouse snitches. To obtain convictions, prosecutors sometimes rely on the testimony of jailhouse informants who claim to have heard the defendant confess to the crime while incarcerated… prosecutors are required to inform the defense when deals with informants are made. Sometimes they do not…  Prosecutorial misconduct was part of what led Governor Ryan to impose a moratorium on executions in Illinois. Chicago Tribune reporters conducted research on prosecutorial misconduct in Illinois. They identified 381 murder cases reversed on prosecutorial misconduct grounds, such as withholding exculpatory evidence, improper argument, and suborning of perjury, among others.”"

01	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""This country isn't about to end birthright citizenship, the longstanding practice under which children born on U.S. soil are granted citizenship even if their parents came here illegally.   The political will doesn't exist to get a constitutional amendment through Congress followed by ratification by 38 states. It's equally unlikely that even a Congress and White House controlled by Republicans could muster enough support to pass a law pretending the 14th Amendment doesn’t mean what it seems to say.   Among other things, birthright citizenship helps spur assimilation and integration of young immigrants into the larger society. And if they've actually grown up here, how are they less American than anyone else?   Yes, birthright citizenship may attract some pregnant 'birth tourists' who come to this country to have children. But the vast majority of immigrants, legal and illegal, come for other reasons — and mostly for economic opportunity.  It's fine if GOP candidates want to push for tighter restrictions on immigration and stronger enforcement of existing laws. That's the responsible way to reduce birthright citizenship. But it is both futile and counterproductive to go after a right conferring citizenship on people who have spent as much of their lives in this country as the rest of us."""
01	Should the US Use Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) to Extract Natural Gas?	"""Hydraulic fracturing has been a key technology in making shale gas an affordable addition to the Nation's energy supply, and the technology has proven to be a safe and effective stimulation technique. Ground water is protected during the shale gas fracturing process by a combination of the casing and cement that is installed when the well is drilled and the thousands of feet of rock between the fracture zone and any fresh or treatable aquifers... While challenges continue to exist with water availability and water management, innovative regional solutions are emerging that allow shale gas development to continue while ensuring that the water needs of other users can be met and that surface and ground water quality is protected."""
01	Will Alternative Energy Development Increase US Energy Independence and Security?	"""The key to energy independence is to be able to create, capture and store energy from a wide variety of sources. The economic opportunities arise when a variety of solutions are developed that support different environments. Once commercialized, the solutions can be sold around the globe for the same national and environmental security reasons. Alternative energy development is a win-win for everyone on the planet...  There is so much at stake driving the US to achieve energy independence. As the price of a barrel of oil declines, and prices at the gas pump also drop, we cannot be lulled into complacency and reduce the level of urgency in achieving independence. This time around, everyone in the country must play an active role in getting off the petroleum importing rollercoaster. Through a combination of personal conservation and alternative energy usage we can get this country back on track."""
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""International and national bodies have determined that several methods of execution are likely to violate the prohibition of torture, because of the pain and suffering they are likely to inflict on the convicted person. Studies of the severe pain and suffering caused by other methods has continued to extend this list, to the point where it has become increasingly difficult for a State to impose the death penalty without violating international human rights law.   The long and highly stressful period that most individuals endure while waiting on 'death row' for years, or even decades, and frequently in isolation, for an uncertain outcome, has also been referenced as constituting torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment...   Furthermore, when the authorities fail to give adequate information about the timing of executions, they maintain not only the convicted person but also his children and other family members in permanent anticipation of imminent death. This acute mental distress, which may be compounded by failure to return the body to families for burial, or inform them of the location of burial, is unjustifiable...   There are many reasons why we should move away from the death penalty, starting with its capricious and frequently discriminatory application, and its failure to demonstrate any deterrent effect beyond that of other punishments. The severe mental and physical suffering which are inflicted by capital punishment on the person concerned and family members should now be added to the weight of the argument. The use of the death penalty should be ended."""
01	Do Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide Violate the Hippocratic Oath?	"""The aim of medicine is, according to the [Hippocratic] Oath, to heal and not to kill.   The Oath made clear what it means to 'do no harm.' The meaning of 'injury or wrongdoing' was named specifically as abortion, euthanasia, sexual abuse, and breach of confidentiality. In contrast, in postmodern medicine the interpretation of what constitutes 'harm' lies in the eye of the beholder. The Kevorkian spectacle has illustrated this... The jury accepted Kevorkian’s defense that he was only aiming at the relief of suffering and he was set free. No one pointed out the obvious that the means used to relieve suffering was to kill the patient. This case, along with others that followed, contributed to the deconstruction of Hippocratic medicine and the subsequent promotion of postmodern medicine; moving the profession of medicine away from the aim of healing and into the murky waters of relief of suffering through assisted suicide and euthanasia."""
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“[T]he Supreme Court found that a generalized right to privacy it had basically invented, meant that a woman has a constitutional right to snuff out an unborn life, a human being with a beating heart. That’s what a fetus as young as six weeks is. …Some estimates are that as many as 55 million abortions — 55 million — have occurred since the Court acted. In that time, science has given us an ever clearer picture of just how much of a baby a fetus is. At 20 weeks, we now know, these tiny creatures can hear, even recognize a mother’s voice. Their toenails are growing and their hearts beat loud enough to be heard by a stethoscope. The moral case for allowing such beings to be killed grows ever weaker and its advocates resort to ever more absurd euphemisms to describe what they support. They’re not really pro-abortion, they’ve long said, they’re pro-choice. This isn’t about killing unborn babies, it’s about reproductive health. And the biggest chain of abortion clinics in the country refers to itself as Planned Parenthood.”

It projects that Canada will double its current tar sands production over the next decade to more than 1.8 million barrels a day. That rate will mean cutting down some 740,000 acres of boreal forest — a natural carbon reservoir...  Canada's government is committed to the tar sands business...

10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	"Privatizing Social Security would do nothing to solve its impending insolvency, and would actually make it worse. The trust funds are destined for insolvency because the program's cost is increasing at a faster rate than revenue from payroll taxes. The situation will get even worse if a portion of each individual's payroll taxes is diverted away from the Social Security trust funds and into individually controlled retirement accounts, shrinking the funding source for future retirees' benefits. [3] [35] According to a 1997 Brookings Institution analysis, if just 1% of payroll taxes had been diverted to private accounts in 1998, the trust funds would have been insolvent by 2015. [36] William A. Galston, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, said about President George W. Bush's 2005 privatization proposal that ""it was not clear how private accounts were even part of the solution.

Ironically, those who argue that national security concerns are reasons to oppose changing U.S. policy towards Cuba ignore that the embargo has also become somewhat of a U.S. security liability itself.

10	Should the United States Authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline to Import Tar Sand Oil from Canada?

An overwhelming objection is that exploitation of tar sands would make it implausible to stabilize climate and avoid disastrous global climate impacts. The tar sands are estimated (e.g., see IPCC Fourth Assessment Report) to contain at least 400 GtC (equivalent to about 200 ppm CO2). Easily available reserves of conventional oil and gas are enough to take atmospheric CO2 well above 400 ppm, which is unsafe for life on earth. However, if emissions from coal are phased out over the next few decades and if unconventional fossil fuels including tar sands are left in the ground, it is conceivable to stabilize earth's climate."""

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“The gold standard might sound good – who, especially Donald Trump, doesn’t love gold and standards? – but it’s one of the worst economic ideas ever. This is a harebrained policy that no other country uses and not a single surveyed economist thinks is a good idea… Under the gold standard, a dollar is worth a certain amount of gold. And since gold is a commodity whose price swings wildly, a central bank like the Federal Reserve would have to raise and cut interest rates based not on how well the economy is doing, but on what’s going on in the gold market. It’s a good way to run a modern economy into the ground.”

10	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Epilepsy (Seizures)?	recent anecdotal reports of positive effects of the marijuana derivative cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give reason for hope. However, we must remember that these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is lacking. The lack of information does not mean that marijuana is ineffective for epilepsy. It merely means that we do not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment for epilepsy, which is why it should be studied using the well-founded research methods that all other effective treatments for epilepsy have undergone. Such safety concerns coupled with a lack of evidence of efficacy in controlled studies result in a risk/benefit ratio that does not support use of marijuana for treatment of seizures at this time. Healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers are reminded that use of marijuana for epilepsy may not be advisable due to this lack of information on safety and efficacy.”
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would decrease high school enrollment rates and increase drop-out rates. Mark J.

The use of pennies in paying for goods and making change adds time to sales transactions. A study by Walgreen's and the National Association of Convenience Stores found that pennies add 2 to 2.5 seconds to each cash transaction. [27] As a result of that extra time per transaction, the average citizen wastes 730 seconds a year (12 minutes) paying with pennies. [28] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw says that this wasted time costs the US economy around $1 billion annually. [29] An estimate from Citizens to Retire the penny says that the 107 billion cash transactions in the United States annually add up to 120 million hours of time between customers and employees - at a cost of $2 billion to the US economy.

Government space, however, belongs to everyone. The First Amendment requires the government to treat all religions equally and to show no preference towards religious people or non-religious people. The First Amendment has allowed many religions to flourish and helped the U.S. avoid many of the religious conflicts that have torn apart other nations. The ACLU strongly promotes the rights of individuals and religious communities to express their religious beliefs, but recognizes that governments should never become the vehicles for the promotion of one group’s religious beliefs and that government property should not be used for the promotion of religion or non-religion unless it is made available for all beliefs on an equal basis.”

When that happens, the board is empowered to make recommendations to bring costs back into line.

01	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""[L]ow intakes [of calcium] predispose to development of osteoporosis by reducing achieved peak bone mass during growth and by causing or aggravating age-related bone loss later in life…high calcium intakes are recognized as protective against osteoporosis.  It is long established and well understood that milk supports growth; thus, it is evident that milk and milk products are good sources of the nutrients needed for bone development and maintenance.  One sometimes encounters arguments that the protein and sodium of milk somehow negate the potential benefit of its calcium. These speculations are based on the established fact that both protein and sodium lead to increased urinary calcium excretion. However, the negative effects of protein and sodium are observed mainly at low calcium intakes, when, with absorption already operating at an individual's maximum, there is no possibility of increasing calcium extraction from the diet so as to offset an increment in excretory loss...  [E]ven at low calcium intakes, the ratio of the calcium in milk to its sodium and protein content is so high as to offset directly any calciuric effects; that is, even without physiological adjustment, the calcium absorbed exceeds the calcium eliminated by virtue of sodium and protein...a diet low in dairy foods means a diet that is poor in several respects beyond insufficiency of calcium."""

01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Over-the-Counter (OTC) birth control would increase access for low-income and medically underserved populations. Twenty million women live in “contraception deserts,” places with one clinic or fewer per 1,000 women who need government-funded birth control from programs such as Medicare. [11] In underserved communities, women could more easily find a local drug store for medication. 11-21% of sexually active low-income women studied were more likely to use the Pill if it were available OTC. [12] [13]Denicia Cadena, Policy Director for Young Women United in New Mexico, stated: “Our rural communities are most profoundly impacted by our state’s health care and provider shortages. Patients face three- to six-month wait times for any primary care and even longer for specialty care… 11 of the state’s 33 counties have no obstetrics and gynecology physicians.” [3] Birth control can be difficult for many women to obtain, particularly teens, immigrants, women of color, and the uninsured. [3] The National Latina Institute of Reproductive Health stated: “over-the-counter access will greatly reduce the systemic barriers, like poverty, immigration status and language, that currently prevent Latinas from regularly accessing birth control and results in higher rates of unintended pregnancy.” [14] Other medically underserved communities, such as LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and others) people, are more than twice as likely to be uninsured (15% of all LGBT+ compared to 7% of non-LGBT+ people) and more likely to face discrimination in the healthcare industry, resulting in less or no reproductive healthcare.

10	Is Gender Nonconforming Behavior in Children Indicative of Adult Homosexual Orientation?	non-conformity is believed by many researchers and theorists of same-sex sexuality to be the behavioural expression of congenital gender inversion. Hence from such a perspective, a ‘homosexual’, that is, a gender invert, will behave in gender non-conforming ways from early childhood. Childhood gender non-conformity inevitably includes stereotypical activities such as avoidance of rough and tumble play for boys and engaging same for girls, commonly known as tomboy and sissy behaviour… Feminist approaches reject the idea that same-sex sexuality is about gender inversion. This perspective recognises that the sexual self is moulded by social forces and conscious will, that all human beings are born with the potential to be sexual, rather than with a particular sexual orientation, and that the direction of sexual preference, or sexual orientation, is socially determined, and influenced by the values and social arrangements of the dominant culture… The connection between gender non-conformity and adult sexuality, too, is socially constructed.”

10	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""Milk is a primary source of calcium and vitamin D and therefore might be expected to decrease osteoporotic bone loss and fracture risk, yet research has not generally supported this assumption. Evidence from clinical trials and case-control studies has been mixed, and several observational studies found no decrease in risk of bone fracture with higher consumption of milk and dairy foods...  Milk is a good source of both calcium and vitamin D, yet fortified milk also contains significant amounts of vitamin A, which has been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. In this study among postmenopausal women, milk was not associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture, even among those drinking 600 mL.  In conclusion, our study adds to the evidence that adequate vitamin D intake is associated with a lower occurrence of osteoporotic hip fractures in postmenopausal women. A high-calcium diet appears to be of less importance. Although fortified milk is one of the few food sources of vitamin D, high consumption does not appear to substantially reduce the risk of hip fracture, perhaps because of other nutrients in the milk, such as vitamin A, that do not support bone health."""

Practically, there is no room for two viable states in a territory the size of New Jersey.

As welcome as those results would be, they're based on the illusion that renewable fuels are an energy panacea and that the market is ignoring an easy answer that wise politicians can clearly see. But the facts just don't support this. Yes, renewable fuels will constitute a part of our energy mix in the future, but they represent only a tiny fraction of our energy needs and won't lead us out of the economic and environmental wilderness…  Taking into account the EIA's projected increases in electricity demand, the renewable sector would need to grow 19% per year for 22 years consecutively to meet U.S. demand by the year 2030. Clearly, these targets are overly ambitious and impractical…  The government cannot create wealth or jobs; all it can do is take from Peter to pay Paul, opening up a job in 'green industry A' by eliminating one in 'fossil fuel industry B.'"""

10	Does the ACLU Support Child Pornography?	4623 [‘Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2002’] seeks to ban ‘virtual child pornography,’ and prohibit pandering of images as child pornography even if the images are not obscene or child pornography. It creates a whole new category of prohibited speech, prohibits using sexually explicit materials to facilitate offenses against minors, creates extraterritorial jurisdiction, and creates a database of minors who have been exploited in the creation of child pornography. The ACLU opposes child pornography that uses real children in its depictions. Material, however, which is produced without using real children, and is not otherwise obscene, is protected under the First Amendment.” [Editor’s Note: H.R. 4623 – The Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2002 was referred in Oct. 2002 to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. It died in committee without becoming a law.]
10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""Drug use is a serious concern, not only for the concepts of integrity and fair play in competitive sports, but because of the health threats to the athletes. Certainly drug testing programs should continue with increasing numbers of athletes being tested and increasing penalties for detection, since these are most likely means of deterrence. Drug education programs must also continue in a further attempt to curtail the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs by empowering the young athlete with the information and skills to make responsible and healthy decisions."""

01	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Most Americans equate illegal aliens with a higher incidence of crime... in fact, data show that the American public understands the facts better than the academics. Adult illegal aliens represented 3.1 percent of the total adult population of the country in 2003. By comparison, the illegal alien prison population represented a bit more than 4.54 percent of the overall prison population. Therefore, deportable criminal aliens were more than half again as likely to be incarcerated as their share of the population."""
01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Obesity, like alcoholism, depression, and anxiety, is a disease. There are definite medical patterns: hormone imbalances, neurotransmitter deficiencies and nutritional exhaustion that all contribute to obesity. Many of my patients that are obese have underlying medical issues that need to be addressed. I agree that there are behavior patterns that contribute to obesity, but these same behavior patterns are rooted in other biological factors. Stress, the standard American diet and the industrialization of food have all been blamed in the obesity epidemic. While all of these factors contribute to being obese, they also create critical biological imbalances that people cannot overcome, or do not have the tools or knowledge to understand how to change. Diets and exercise regimens often fail simply because the underlying medical pathology has not been addressed. My approach is to evaluate a patient fully, including family history, exhaustive hormone evaluation, nutrient status, and life inventory to understand where to begin in treating this disease. There is no quick weight loss for the obese.”
01	Has Obamacare Improved Medicaid? - DEBATED	"""In [Medicaid] expansion states, the percentage of Medicaid recipients who reported poor access to care declined from 8.5% prior to the expansion to 7.3% after the expansion. For Medicaid recipients in states where there was no expansion, the percentage remained constant at 5.3%. There was also no differences between expansion and control states in terms of increase or decrease of emergency department use. It did not appear that adding new enrollees worsened the access of those persons who were already enrolled in the program...  To improve access for Medicaid patients, the ACA included a provision that requires that Medicaid reimburse primary care providers at Medicare rates during 2013 and 2014."""

10	Should the US Build More Hydropower Dams?	"""Hydropower dams will continue to play a role in our nation's energy portfolio. But we cannot responsibly meet our nation's 21st century energy needs by damming new rivers or by weakening environmental protections designed to protect rivers from harmful dam operations...  Low-power dams (many of which are physically quite large, despite insistence by developers that they are 'small') harm streams in the same ways as dams that produce more power. Multiple low-power dams scattered on multiple streams add up to major environmental impacts that can be greater than that of a single large dam...  Dams disrupt flows, degrade water quality, block the movement of a river's vital nutrients and sediment, destroy fish and wildlife habitat, impede migration of fish and other aquatic species, and eliminate recreational opportunities. Reservoirs slow and broaden rivers, making them warmer. The environmental, economic, and societal footprint of a dam and reservoir may extend well beyond the immediate area, impacting drinking water, recreation, fisheries, wildlife, and wastewater disposal."""

And we learned that their sons are not the only ones at risk. As many as 500,000 teenagers have experimented with steroids...  This legislation is an effort to break the cycle of steroid use that endangers our children. Aspiring young athletes need to know that steroid use in the pros leads to suspension and expulsion, not home run records and adulation. The tough standards in this legislation will reduce the use of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports. And in doing so, the legislation will reduce the use of these dangerous drugs by college and high-school athletes.  There is an absolute correlation between the culture of steroids in the major league clubhouse and the culture of steroids in high school gyms. If we can remove steroids from the clubhouse, we will fix the problems in school locker rooms."""
10	Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?	"""Do not grant amnesty to illegal aliens. Regardless of the penalties imposed, any program that grants individuals who are unlawfully present the legal permission to remain here rewards illegal behavior and is unfair to those who obey the law and go through the regula­tory and administrative requirements to enter the country legally. Those who enter the United States illegally should not be rewarded with permanent legal status or other such benefits, and they should be penalized in any road to citizenship. Those who enter and remain in the country illegally are violating the law, and condoning or encouraging such violations increases the likelihood of further illegal conduct. The only fair way to resolve this problem is to insist that individuals currently in the country who have violated immigration statutes leave and then apply for admission through legal means."""
01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""How interested are we in fairness in sport? Athletes try to enhance their performance in many ways: coaches, psychologists, dietitians, massage therapists, training at high altitude, skin-tight swimsuits. All of these are used to gain an advantage, which is often unfair because, like drugs, they are available to some – wealthy athletes rather than cheats – but not to everyone.   The Tour de France, a sporting event well known for drug use, would not suddenly become a level contest if drug use disappeared. The race winner has his performance enhanced by the quality of his team...  Given that drugs are significantly cheaper than psychologists, permitting their use might actually level out the playing field for poorer athletes. Finally, if fairness is our major concern we can easily solve the problem by lifting the prohibition – thus making drugs available to all athletes."""

Ever try to build a wall on a river, or atop an Indian burial ground, or through the library of a state university? It’s tricky. And once the environmentalists and the EPA get involved, it’s nearly impossible.   Then there’s the fact that no one seems to know what it would cost. In the last six years, estimates for building a fence—which is probably much cheaper than building a wall—have ranged wildly from $1 million per mile to $15 million per mile, depending on where the fence goes. At that price, fencing for 2,000 miles would cost between $2 billion and $30 billion…   [W]alls don’t just keep people out but also pen people in. So those 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here won’t feel so inclined to go home to Mexico for Christmas or Mother’s Day, like they used to, and where there was always a chance that some of them would stay.

10	Are Electronic Voting Machines the Best Way to Provide Access to Language Minorities?	"""Technical experts and advocacy groups have brought to our attention the serious matter of electronic voting systems' ability to process electronic ballots differently when different languages are chosen. Experience has taught us to be wary of differences in the treatment of different ethnic groups, since differences inevitably present opportunities for unjust discrimination. Indeed, there is already evidence that these differences in processing may be discriminating against minority voters.   Votes cast in Spanish were lost during a touch screen machine demonstration to the California legislature, but the system worked properly when English was chosen. Touch-screen review screens failed to display votes properly when Spanish was selected in official parallel testing on election day in Palm Beach County, Florida. In New Mexico, during the 2004 election, electronic ballots in Hispanic and Native American precincts registered three times as many undervotes (no vote cast) as the electronic ballots in Anglo precincts. But when the state switched to paper ballots, the undervote rates in minority precincts were comparable to those in Anglo precincts.   While electronic voting machines promise greater accessibility for voters with limited English proficiency and those who have disabilities, the opportunity they present for ethnic profiling by language choice is unacceptable."""
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“I may be the odd person out, but I always felt advertising to consumers is a reasonable thing for the industry to do. A) There is the First Amendment. You make new products. Why can’t you tell people about it? Why should that industry be forbidden to do it, when the auto industry can advertise SUVs? Right? You can ask yourself. Secondly, we’ve found in research that quite a few patients don’t actually get the drugs. There were these studies on beta blockers that said only about half the patients in America got beta blockers after a heart attack. Well, you could ask, ‘Wouldn’t it have been good if on television they had seen, ‘If your loved one has a heart attack, be sure to ask that he gets beta blockers?” So I think I’m on the industry side on that. The money isn’t that overwhelming. I think it’s something like $8 billion, maybe $10 [billion], that they’re spending on it. Doctors and HMO executives are vexed by this, because you have patients coming to the doctor and say, ‘ want Vioxx,’ or ‘I want this drug or that drug.’ My feeling is, that’s why we have doctors. A good doctor should say, ‘Yes, it’s a drug,’ or say, ‘Actually, let me show you. I have a study here. That drug, for the money, isn’t worth it.’ That is the doctor’s job. So I don’t understand why you would take away freedom of speech to an industry, when it’s so easy to counter it.”

But it is truly about that thing that defines free human beings: the right to self-determination instead of a one-size-fits-all approach in private matters, in those issues that take place in bedrooms and kitchens and hospices. It's a primal demand for a personal sense of control in the face of intrusive government, intrusive medicine and intrusive strangers who think holding a crucifix like a blunt instrument makes them righteous when it really only makes them sanctimonious...  The Schiavo case has asked us to look at our own definition of life, not at some formless notion cobbled out of the Bible, medical textbooks and impersonal sentiment.  ...Once the feeding tube was removed, polls showed that the majority of Americans believed Terri Schiavo should be allowed to die.

His environmental record is probably comparable to Teddy Roosevelt’s in terms of the steps he took to try to protect our environment. On foreign affairs … he preserved the peace and he did it in a way that established the United States as a world leader.

At its root, the lack of health care for all in America is fundamentally a moral issue. The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not have some form of universal health care (defined as a basic guarantee of health care to all of its citizens). While other countries have declared health care to be a basic right, the United States treats health care as a privilege, only available to those who can afford it… Americans purport to believe in equal opportunity. Yet, in the current situation, those who do not have health care are at risk for financial ruin and poorer health, both of which disadvantage them in society and thereby do not give them equal opportunity… The Declaration of Independence states there are certain ‘inalienable rights’, including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If Americans believe in an inalienable right to life, how can we tolerate a system that denies people lifesaving medications and treatments? Similarly, if Americans believe in an inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness, how can we allow millions of dreams to be smashed by the financial and physical consequences of uninsurance?”
10	Was Bill Clinton a Good President?	Education: Clinton's Goals 2000 program did not ensure uniform quality of standards among all the states because he compromised on oversight to get the program passed. The impact therefore varied by state and Clinton never fulfilled his goal of equalizing education standards and improving results for all students. By 2000, six years after IASA was implemented, only 17 states were in full compliance with the standards. [12] Read More
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“The American Academy of Family Physicians recognizes that unintended pregnancies are a major public health concern, accounting for approximately 50% of US pregnancies. Access and cost are commonly cited reasons why women have gaps in contraceptive use or do not use contraception. While oral contraceptive pills are widely considered to be safe and effective medications, they continue to require a prescription for use, further restricting access. The AAFP recognizes that though contraindications to these medications do exist, women have been shown to correctly self-identify contraindications to use when using a standardized check-list. Over 100 countries round the world currently provide oral contraceptive pills over the counter without a prescription. The AAFP supports over-the-counter access to oral contraception without a prescription.”
10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""Amid the blizzard of data concerning immigrants' effects on wages, welfare and municipal budgets, the essential point is this: The latest wave of immigrants -- legal and illegal, skilled and unskilled -- has stimulated enormous economic activity and wealth generation in this country, and it is implausible that the American economy would fare as well without them... Since most immigrants come when they are young and working... they tend not to collect Social Security or Medicare for many years -- even while paying into the systems with payroll taxes, in many cases with phony Social Security numbers (meaning they will contribute but not collect). In fact, illegal immigrants do not get federal welfare benefits of any kind. At the same time they often pay income tax (through paycheck withholdings) and sales tax, thereby helping directly or indirectly to underwrite transportation, health care, education and other services. And while immigrants surely have contributed to some extent to the ranks of the poor, that was also true of previous waves of immigrants; the point is, most of those immigrants didn't stay poor."""
10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	"Social media enables the spread of unreliable and false information. 64% of people who use Twitter for news say that they have encountered something they ""later discovered wasn't true,"" and 16% of Twitter news users say that ""they had retweeted or posted a tweet they later discovered to be false."" [227] A study published in the journal Science found that lies spread six times faster than the truth on Twitter, and ""fake news"" is retweeted more often than true news. [278] In the three months prior to the 2016 US presidential election, false news stories about the two candidates were shared a total of 37.6 million times on Facebook. [269] A federal grand jury indictment announced in Feb. 2018 by special counsel Robert Mueller said that a Russian group created phony social media accounts ""to reach significant numbers of Americans for purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system."" [279] A University of Michigan study found that even when false information is corrected, the number of people who see or share the correction via social media is lower than number who saw or shared the false information in the first place.

01	Should the United States Authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline to Import Tar Sand Oil from Canada?	"""[C]onstruction of the pipeline is necessary to replace the declining imports of heavy crude from Venezuela and Mexico...   [T]he pipeline would substantially reduce American dependency on oil from volatile regions, including the Middle East...   Keystone XL would not appreciably increase global life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. These findings were reinforced by the final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the State Department on Friday.   There are tremendous economic benefits to the United States from an integrated energy strategy. There are more than 900 American companies exporting equipment and supplies to the oil sands; 70 of them are from New York and New Jersey.   The construction of Keystone XL would create 20,000 direct and 118,000 indirect jobs, providing the kind of infrastructure stimulus that your editorials have promoted."""
01	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""It is always possible to modify a voting machine in a laboratory. That proves nothing. The question is whether any tampering is feasible involving a large number of machines under real election conditions. No one has even proposed, let alone demonstrated, a plausible scenario by which that might be done. Each machine is an island never connected to the internet. The software cannot be modified during an election — any tampering would have to be done in advance in a guarded warehouse that is under video surveillance. It can’t be done quickly, either. Machines must be forklifted off high shelves, seals must be broken, new stealth software installed and forged seals applied...  To this day, no evidence exists that any electronic voting machine used in an election in the United States has been tampered with, or even that any attempt has been made to perform such tampering."""
01	Should Victims' Opinions Matter When Considering the Death Penalty?	"""Victims in Connecticut have a constitutional right to make a statement to the court at sentencing, and the Commission strongly believes that victim impact statements are and should be a critical part of the criminal justice process. In many cases, victims’ friends and relatives want the accused to hear and understand the impact that the crime has had on them.  The opportunity to speak at sentencing allows victims to share thoughts and feelings that would not be allowed at the time of trial. The victim impact statement can also make many in the court, including court personnel, the judge, the public and the media, aware of the victim’s perspective. The opportunity to speak on the day of sentencing makes their statement and their perception of their loved one a part of the permanent record of the court...  For victims to have confidence in the criminal justice system, the system must be responsive to their needs and those of their families. A victim’s inability to provide impact statements during the penalty phase limits, in the victim’s view, the information before the court or jury at a time when proper punishment of the accused is being considered."""
10	Are Felons More Likely to Vote for Democrats over Republicans?

01	Should People Who Are Lactose Intolerant Consume Milk Anyway?	"""Individuals vary in their degree of lactose intolerance, but even children and teenagers with primary lactose intolerance can usually consume 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1.5 cups) of milk without experiencing symptoms.   Although the degree of lactose intolerance varies, most people with lactose intolerance do not require a completely lactose free diet. Milk and milk products should not be completely eliminated because they provide key nutrients such as calcium, vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The sociological and psychological data supporting the legal and policy justifications for the decriminalization or legalization of prostitution reveal that the costs of criminal prohibition outweigh the benefits. The evidence concerning the negative impacts of the present criminal status of prostitution supports the conclusion of the San Francisco Committee on Crime that 'we can do little worse by trying something different.' The evidence concerning the positive effects of decriminalization suggests that we can do a great deal better."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“In a multiple-choice, test-driven world, kids are taught that there is always a right answer and moreover that the answer is always given to them. Kids learn early on that they don’t have to think outside the box, they don’t have to be creative, collaborative or be critical thinkers. They just have to be good at memorizing rote facts and eliminating the wrong answers. Of course if they get stuck, just follow the advice my eighth grade son’s principal gives and choose the letter ‘C’… The irony is stultifying. While the Chinese are moving to an education system that innovates, we have transformed ours into a bureaucratic, centralized Politburo that rewards test takers and stifles out-of-the-box thinkers.”
01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“[Reagan] transformed a sputtering U.S. economy into a rocket of growth that led to a generation of prosperity. He restored a neglected U.S. military and its alliances, engineering the eventual defeat of the Soviet empire, without starting a war and without firing a shot. Through it all, he revived America’s spirit, restored our hopes, and strengthened our faith… [H]e cut taxes deeply and equally for everyone, eventually dropping the top rate all the way from 70 percent to 28 percent, while providing enterprises strong incentives to compete and restoring a dollar as good as gold. He fought hard against ever expanding, encroaching bureaucracy, reduced non-defense spending, and eliminated subsidies and price controls… A strong dollar slew double-digit inflation and restored confidence. Lower tax rates encouraged women to enter the workforce in large numbers, many of them starting up new businesses, while minority employment and enterprises also grew. The rising tide of growth gave birth to new industries, propelling America’s technology boom in the 1990s. In short, the American people unleashed the most powerful postwar recovery in history, reducing poverty, raising incomes, and creating a prosperity that benefited every income group, rejuvenated our communities, and lifted up the entire global economy.”
01	Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?	"Corporal punishment is often chosen by students over suspension or detention. When given the choice, students frequently choose corporal punishment because it is a quick punishment that doesn't cause older children to miss class or other activities, or younger children to miss their valued time on the playground. [26] The child's education is not interrupted and make-up work is not required for missed class instruction. Allison Collins, a high school senior at Robbinsville High School in North Carolina, stated she chose corporal punishment over in-school suspension when her phone rang in class. [26] Her principal, David Matheson, stated, ""Most kids will tell you that they choose the paddling so they don't miss class."" [26]"
10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	"OTC birth control pills would decrease birth control choice and access. Vanessa Cullins, MD, obstetrician-gynecologist, noted that there were over 40 brands of birth control pills and “not every formulation will go over the counter."" [73] By making a few choices available OTC, women are more likely to follow the path of least resistance and choose those available at a drug store rather than by prescription, even if it isn’t the right variety of birth control for them. The FDA-approved contraceptive methods that would not be available over-the-counter include IUDs (both copper and with progestin), the implantable rod, and shots such as Depo-Provera, plus sterilization procedures, all of which the FDA states are more effective than the Pill. [74]Journalist Sarah Elizabeth Richards points out, “Women visiting their pharmacists won't have access to the most reliable forms of birth control on the market because those methods, such as implantable rods or intrauterine devices (IUDs), will still require a trip to a doctor's office.” [75] And, even within birth control pill brands, choice will be limited. Most effort is focused on making the progestin-only (also called POP or minipills) OTC, rather than the estrogen and progestin pills (also called combination pills). [76] The most recent data states that only 0.4% of American reproductive-aged women take progestin-only birth control pills, or about 2% of all women who take the Pill. [77] Read More"
10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Regardless of any role animal experiments may have played in the past, the mounting evidence shows that using animals today is largely ineffective in helping us understand human physiology, predict human toxins and find useful drugs. Despite some similarities between humans and non-human animals, medicine now deals with the subtle nuances of physiological mechanisms and genetics that are unique to humans. While animals may be ‘whole models,’ they are the wrong whole models because of inter-species differences. Failures of animal experiments have led to human harm. Moreover, misleading animal experiments may have caused the abandonment of effective drugs and cures. One can’t help wonder: how many people would have been saved if we used more effective human-based testing methods? Animal experimentation is a relic of the past. Instead of wasting time, human and animal lives, and our tax dollars on misleading animal experiments, we must devote our resources into finding and using sophisticated human-based tests that mimic the whole human body. Our lives depend on this.”
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Just as every other industrialized nation has figured out how to provide health care to all their citizens and how to get drug makers to negotiate the prices of their products, each of those countries (with the exception of New Zealand) also bans direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs… All those other countries have it right, and we don’t. Doctors spend precious minutes of ever-shorter office visits explaining to patients why their cholesterol drug is every bit as good as the one they saw on television, or why feeling sad at the death of a loved one doesn’t require an antidepressant. Hawking medications to the public encourages rapid adoption of new products that may be no better — or even worse — than older, unadvertised generic drugs. [T]his advertising promotes only the most expensive products, it drives prescription costs up and also encourages the ‘medicalization’ of American life — the sense that pills are needed for most everyday problems that people notice, and many that they don’t.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""So is the solar revolution finally here? Not quite. Even after a decade of rampant growth solar energy still barely moves the needle in the U.S. energy mix. In fact, solar merely equals the amount of electricity that the nation generates by burning natural gas captured from landfills…  The biggest sources are the old standbys. Oil still reigns supreme at 36 quadrillion Btu, natural gas at 26 quads, nuclear 8. Hydropower and biomass bring up the rear at 2.6 and 2.7 quads. Wind is just 1.5 quads. And coal — the great carbon-belching demon of the global energy mix — its contribution is 19 quads. That’s nearly 8 times all the nation's wind and solar generation combined…  For all the talk of 'grid parity' the simple reality is that even combined with far more power generation from natural gas, renewable alternatives will need decades to push out coal. And the irony will be that as demand for coal lessens, it will become cheaper and cheaper, making it even more attractive for the coal-burning power plants that survive the coming cull…  Coal has gotten immensely cleaner over the past generation. And new and better ways will be found to extract energy from coal without sending its dangerous byproducts into the environment. It's scalable and reliable in ways that renewable energy sources simply aren't. In short, unless we’re willing to put up with blackouts that freeze grandma in the winter and melt her in the summer, coal will remain a mainstay of U.S. power generation for decades to come."""
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“[L]owering the drinking age would be harmful in two ways. First, young people, those most likely to be harmed from drinking, will have greater access to alcohol. Second, lowering the drinking age may lead to lowered perception of risk. When perception of risk from a particular substance decreases, prevalence rates tend to increase. If the perception of risk is increased, then drinking quantity and frequency may decrease. For example, my colleagues and I found that compared to Caucasians, African-Americans tend to report later initiation to alcohol, lower rates of use, engage in less heavy drinking and show slower increases in rates of drinking across adolescence and young adulthood. These racial differences may be in part because perception of risk is stronger among African-American parents and peers, and they consider alcohol more harmful than their white counterparts.”

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Studies claiming a causal link between video game violence and real life violence are flawed. [34] Many studies failed to control for factors that contribute to children becoming violent, such as family history and mental health, plus most studies do not follow children over long periods of time. [95][10] Video game experiments often have people playing a game for as little as ten minutes, which is not representative of how games are played in real life. In many laboratory studies, especially those involving children, researchers must use artificial measures of violence and aggression that do not translate to real-world violence and aggression, such as whether someone would force another person eat hot sauce or listen to unpleasant noises. [84][94] According to Christopher J. Ferguson, PhD, a psychology professor at Stetson University, ""matching video game conditions more carefully in experimental studies with how they are played in real life makes VVG's [violent video games] effects on aggression essentially vanish.""

In plans that do provide non-excepted abortion coverage, a separate payment for non-excepted abortion services must be made by the policyholder to the insurer, and the insurer must deposit those payments in a separate allocation account that consists solely of those payments; the insurer must use only the amounts in that account to pay for non-excepted abortion services."""
01	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. Ingredients, such as thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum, can be harmful in large doses but they are not used in harmful quantities in vaccines. Children are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they are exposed to in vaccines. [46] Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. [46] With the exception of inactivated flu vaccines, thimerosal (a mercury compound) has been removed or reduced to trace amounts in vaccines for children under 6 years old. [47] The FDA requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the CDC and the FDA to make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safe.

My admiration for relaxed European attitudes toward sex comes to an excruciatingly cacophonous halt on the issue of legalized prostitution.  Women's-rights activists believe the German government's sanctioning of sex services for World Cup visitors will drive the illicit international trade in sex trafficking. This, in turn, could force thousands of unwilling women into prostitution.  Whether women enter the sex trade willingly or not, no government should sanction prostitution.

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“There is no need for a civilized society to tolerate the type of gun-related violence that Americans seem to accept as normal. The solution to gun-related crime isn’t further arming the public. It involves enacting comprehensive gun control laws that prohibit many forms of gun ownership, significantly curtailing or eliminating access to and the ability to purchase guns, and implementing programs in which the government confiscates or purchases illegal guns already in circulation among the public. For those firearms that are legal, ownership should be tied not only to background checks, but to extensive and mandatory training in the safe use and storage of weapons. In an era of extreme concern about national security, Americans need to recognize that one of the greatest threats to national security is their own heavily armed population. Unfortunately, our proven inability to handle widespread gun ownership suggests strongly that the way to do this is to deeply restrict access to and ownership of most types of guns.”
01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“The president [George W. Bush] had the right idea, but he used the wrong word. When he used the word privatization, it scared the daylights out of a lot of people… The right word is personalization. Empower individuals to have a greater say over their money.

On the other hand, we have to see a signal back from the Cuban government that it is following through on releasing political prisoners, on providing people their basic human rights, in order for us to be fully engaged with them. And so far, at least, what we haven’t seen is the kind of genuine spirit of transformation inside of Cuba that would justify us eliminating the embargo… And as long as I’m President I will always be prepared to change our Cuba policy if and when we start seeing a serious intention on the part of the Cuban government to provide liberty for its people. But that’s always my watchword, is are we seeing freedom for the Cuban people to live lives of opportunity and prosperity. If we are, then we’ll be supportive of them.” [Editor’s Note: Prior to Mr. Obama’s Sep. 28, 2011 Pro position above, his position was Con as indicated by his Jan. 20, 2004 statement in the opposite column.]
10	Has Obamacare Significantly Reduced the Risk of Medical Bankruptcy? - DEBATED	"""Even with subsidies, insurance premiums are ever less affordable, and for those who need health care, out-of-pocket spending creates significant financial hardships. Since reform under the Affordable Care Act closely mirrors that of Massachusetts, their current experience with medical bankruptcy portends the future of medical bankruptcy throughout the United States.  The Massachusetts experience shows that merely providing insurance coverage to the majority of the population is not enough. The quality of the insurance coverage is crucial. In 2009, 89% of Massachusetts debtors and all their dependents had health insurance at the time of filing, yet the insurance was not effective in reducing the rate of medical bankruptcy below levels that already existed before the full implementation of the Massachusetts health reform program."""
01	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Overwhelming scientific consensus says human activity is primarily responsible for global climate change. The 2010 Anderegg study found that 97-98% of climate researchers publishing most actively in their field agree that human activity is primarily responsible for global climate change.

[7] The 2013 Cook review of 11,944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the position that humans are responsible for global warming. [1] A separate review of 13,950 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found only 24 that rejected human-caused global warming. [5] A survey by German Scientists Bray and Von Storch found that 83.5% of climate scientists believe human activity is causing ""most of recent"" global climate change.

10	Are Felon Disenfranchisement Laws a Form of Racial Discrimination?	"""The frequently heard charge is that disenfranchising felons is racist because the felon population is disproportionately black. But the mere fact that blacks make up a lopsided percentage of the nation's prison population doesn't prove that racism is to blame.   Is the mostly male population of the prisons evidence of reverse sexism? Of course not: men commit the vast majority of serious crimes - a fact no one would dispute - and that's why there are lots more of them than women behind bars.   Regrettably, blacks also commit a disproportionate number of felonies, as victim surveys show. In any case, a felon either deserves his punishment or not, whatever his race. If he does, it may also be that he deserves disenfranchisement. His race, in both cases, is irrelevant."""
10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn. To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demiglace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living.

The body, these waterheads imagine, is a temple that should not be polluted by animal protein. It’s healthier, they insist, though every vegetarian waiter I’ve worked with is brought down by any rumor of a cold. Oh, I’ll accommodate them, I’ll rummage around for something to feed them, for a ‘vegetarian plate’, if called on to do so. Fourteen dollars for a few slices of grilled eggplant and zucchini suits my food cost fine… Like I said before, your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.

01	Should Felons Who Have Completed Their Sentence (Incarceration, Probation, and Parole) Be Allowed to Vote?	"""Felon disenfranchisement is obviously not a strategy of penal deterrence, for it deters no one; or individual rehabilitation, for it clearly educates and reforms no one; or even meaningful punishment, as it is not part of sentencing but is simply imposed on all convicts, regardless of the character of their offense. Rather, it is a strategy of mass electoral suppression, a point that becomes especially vivid when we consider that 1.7 million former offenders have been permanently disenfranchised in eight states, disproportionately in the Deep South."""
10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would encourage companies to outsource jobs to countries where costs would be lower. According to the Statistic Brain Research Institute, 2,382,000 US jobs were outsourced in 2015 with 44% of companies saying they did so to reduce or control costs. [84] A 2014 study of 400 US Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) by Campbell Harvey, PhD, J. Paul Sticht Professor of International Business at Duke University, found that 70% of CFOs would ""increase contracting, outsourcing, or moving actual production outside the United States"" if the minimum wage were raised to $10 an hour.

01	Is Obesity a Disease?	"Obesity can be a genetic disorder such as sickle-cell anemia and Tay-Sachs, which are classified as diseases. Researchers have identified 79 genetic syndromes associated with obesity. [60][61] Studies have shown that obesity can be inherited like height. [5][6] Genetic disposition plays a large role in determining if a person will be obese. [5][6] A May 2014 study published in the Journal of Molecular Psychology linked higher rates of obesity to the ""fat mass and obesity association"" (FTO) gene. [56] The FTO gene reportedly lowers activity in the part of the brain that ""controls impulses and the response to the taste and texture of food,"" so people with the gene are more likely to eat more fatty foods and eat more impulsively as they age. [56] A 1990 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on body mass in twins not raised in the same home concluded, ""genetic influences on body-mass index are substantial, whereas the childhood environment has little or no influence."" [38] In addition to genetic predisposition, almost 10% of morbidly obese people have defects in the genes that regulate food intake, metabolism, and weight. [37] Read More"
01	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""CCS is the most promising technique to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants...

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""A few years ago, prostitutes disappeared from the pages of medical journals; they returned as 'sex workers.' Nor did they work in prostitution any more: they were employees in the 'sex industry.' Presumably, orgasms are now a consumer product just like any other. As for pimps, the correct term is probably: 'brief sexual liaison coordinators.'   The editors who decided on the new terminology almost certainly felt, and probably still do feel, a warm glow of self-satisfaction (one of the few emotions than never lets you down). How they must have prided themselves on their broadmindedness, as they strove to reduce the small-minded stigma traditionally attached to offering sexual services in return for money! How morally brave and daring they must have felt, to fly so boldly in the face of two millennia of unthinking condemnation!...   The idea of the state coercing its population into prostitution is, of course, repellent. Even the most liberal of liberals would probably agree with that. This means that there is after all a moral difference between prostitution and washing dishes in the local restaurant or stacking supermarket shelves. And that prostitution is both age-old and ineradicable does not make it any less degrading to all concerned."""
01	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""People routinely look the other way while employers pay illegal aliens low wages to work grueling hours in unsafe conditions. Some argue that illegals do work that Americans won't do, but the fact is that illegals do work that American's can't do because Americans must adhere to minimum wage and labor laws. Illegals don't have to. This is the 21st century equivalent to slavery.  When cheap labor dominates the market, overall wages naturally go down. When wages go down, American workers are harmed. And when American workers are harmed, the poor are always the first hit. In a free market, helping illegal families invariably harms legal families.  Illegal aliens pay little or no taxes, and they send millions of dollars out of the U.S. to their home country. Illegals are also more likely to use taxpayer-funded social services than citizens. They are entitled to free health care, education and food stamps. Nearly $5 billion per year is spent on illegal aliens.  The Roman Empire based its economy on slave labor, which was one of the key reasons why it fell. This is also one of the main reasons why the South lost the Civil War; relying on slave labor, the South could not match northern industrial and military might. Slave labor weakens nations by reducing exports, hindering technological innovation and turning employers lazy since they are virtually guaranteed profit at low cost. History shows that a national economy based on slave labor, in which a non-taxpaying workforce is supported by a taxpaying workforce, cannot prosper. If left unchecked, the economic consequences of illegal immigration could prove disastrous to America's future."""
01	Will Increased Oil Drilling Help the US Solve Its Energy Crisis?	"""The liberal theocracy in academia, the media and the Democratic Party leadership relentlessly expounds that drilling for oil in the United States won't much affect U.S. gas prices, because petroleum prices are set in global markets...  Although tensions with Iran are growing and pushing up oil prices everywhere, prices have diverged between, for example, U.S. and European markets... This indicates the U.S. market is becoming somewhat separate and less wholly determined by global conditions; hence, more domestic production and increased access to Canadian oil would lower U.S. oil and prices—more drilling in the Gulf and elsewhere in North America, and the Keystone pipeline would significantly affect gas prices and employment...  Recently, the President ridiculed GOP presidential candidates for urging more domestic petroleum development stating, 'Anyone who tells you we can drill our way out of this problem doesn't know they're talking about—or just isn't telling you the truth.'  That's simply not so—drilling for more oil in the United States could make a big difference."""
01	Does Obamacare Provide Tax Credits to Help Some People Purchase Health Insurance on the Exchanges? – YES	"""A number of states have recently released information on what premiums will be in the individual insurance market in 2014, when significant changes in that market take effect due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA)...  However, these premiums are in effect 'sticker prices' that many people will not pay because they will be eligible for federal tax credits under the ACA to offset the cost of insurance...  Premium subsidies (in the form of federal tax credits) will be available for people buying their own insurance in new marketplaces or exchanges who have incomes from 100% up to 400% of the poverty level (about $24,000 to $94,000 per year for a family of four in 2014). Those with access to affordable employer-provided insurance or Medicaid are ineligible for tax credits.  The amount of the tax credit is based on a benchmark premium, which is the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plan in the area where a person lives. The tax credit equals that benchmark premium minus what the individual is expected to pay based on their family income (which is calculated on a sliding scale from 2% to 9.5% of income).  Here is how the calculation might work for a 40-year-old individual making $30,000 a year:  Estimated benchmark premium for a 40-year old = $3,857 per year (which will vary from area to area)  Person is responsible for paying 8.37% of their income = $2,512  Tax credit = $1,345  The tax credit can be used in any plan offered in the health insurance marketplace, so the person would end up paying less than $2,512 to enroll in the lowest cost silver plan or a lower cost bronze plan, and more to enroll in a higher cost plan."""
01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	State-mandated standardized tests help prevent “social promotion,” the practice of allowing students to advance from grade to grade whether or not they have met the academic standards of their grade level. [136] A Dec. 2004 paper by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research found Florida's 2002 initiative to end social promotion, holding back students who failed year-end standardized tests, improved those students' scores by 9% in math and 4% in reading after one year.

10	Does Legal Prostitution Lead to Human Trafficking and Slavery?	"""The fight against THB [trafficking in human beings] for sexual exploitation is often confused with the battle that some people wage against prostitution... [T]here are disadvantages associated with a repressive approach, since such an approach does not distinguish between victims and independent sex workers, and clients will not play a role as a potential source of information on trafficking practices...   It is often said in the media that the lifting of the general ban on brothels has led to more THB. This is not a correct conclusion. Before the lifting of the general ban on brothels, THB and other (criminal) abuses were taking place in all sectors of prostitution. Some of these sectors are now under control and can be assumed to have rid themselves of their former criminal excesses, or are doing so...It is possible that THB is increasing in the illegal, non-regulated or noncontrolled sectors. If this were to be the case, it still cannot be assumed that the extent of THB is now at the same or even above the 'old' level it was at before the ban on brothels was lifted. It is in fact likely that this is not the case, merely because not every client is keen to get involved in the 'secret' prostitution sector."""
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Currently, if a teacher has been teaching for longer than three years, they receive a continuing contract in the State of Idaho – a contract equivalent to tenure. If we truly want to focus on putting students first, we can no longer permit a forever contract in our schools. No credible research shows that tenure helps improve student achievement… Phasing out tenure is not a new idea or something just happening in Idaho. States across the nation have passed or introduced legislation to eliminate tenure or tie it to a teacher’s performance. These states recognize that tenure may have been a rite of passage in the past, but it now serves as an obstacle to improving schools.”
10	Is Same-Sex Attraction a Passing Phase Some Young People Go Through?	traditional standard response to a child or adolescent who expresses same-sex sexual attraction has been to immediately reassure the youngster that his or her feelings are ‘just a phase’ and that such feelings do not indicate the existence of a fixed homosexual orientation. But to always interpret adolescent same-sex sexual impulses as incidental… is a therapeutic error. Such a response also sends the message to the young person that to be lesbian, gay, or bisexual is an undesirable and inferior sexual orientation.”

10	Should the Penny Stay in Circulation? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The penny has practically no value and should be taken out of circulation just as other coins have been in US history. You can't buy anything for a penny; vending machines and parking meters won't accept them. [18] Harvard economist Greg Mankiw stated, ""The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange. The penny no longer serves that purpose. When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful."" [19] Former US Mint Director Philip Diehl said, ""[T]he value of a penny has shrunk to the point that, if you earn more than the minimum wage, you're losing money stopping and picking up a penny on the sidewalk."" [20] Comedian John Oliver noted, ""Two percent of Americans admitted to regularly throwing pennies in the garbage, which means the US Mint is spending millions to make garbage."" [21] Two-thirds of the billions of pennies produced are never seen in circulation again once they reach a consumer via the bank. [22]"
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Few things touch on the sanctity of human life more than the practice of abortion. A pregnancy should not simply be ‘terminated,’ as if it were something impersonal and problematic and it cannot be without physical and emotional consequences. A child in the womb is a distinct, developing, wholly human being, and each time a mother decides or a father pressures to end such a life it is a profound tragedy. Abortion harms the mother as well, and deprives society of the gifts of the unborn. Nevertheless, our laws rarely recognize this, and so FRC uses various media to present the intrinsic dignity of unborn human life and the costs of abortion to the public, to lawmakers, and to the courts. The Roe v. Wade decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, declaring abortion to be a constitutional ‘right,’ was without foundation in the text of the constitution and thus was wrongly decided, and we look forward to the day when this grave error will be corrected.”
10	Is There an Ethical Difference Between Using Performance Enhancing Drugs and Using Performing Enhancing Technologies in Nutrition, Training, and Equipment?	"""EPO is a natural hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, raising the haematocrit (HCT) -- the percentage of the blood comprised by red blood cells...  There are other legal ways to increase the number of red blood cells. Altitude training can push the HCT to dangerous, even fatal, levels. More recently, hypoxic air machines simulate altitude training. The body responds by releasing natural EPO and growing more blood cells, so that the body may absorb more oxygen with every breath...  There is no difference between elevating your blood count by altitude training, by using a hypoxic air machine or by taking EPO. But the latter is illegal. Some competitors have high HCTs and an advantage by luck. Some can afford hypoxic air machines. Is this fair? Nature is not fair."""

"""The ACLU also pushes to repeal Jim Crow-era laws that take away the rights of citizens with criminal convictions...   Dating back to the Jim Crow era, a patchwork of state felony disfranchisement laws, which vary in severity from state to state, prevent approximately 5.85 million Americans with felony and, in several states, misdemeanor convictions from voting. Confusion about and misapplication of these laws also de facto disenfranchise countless other Americans.   Many disenfranchised citizens live in Florida, Iowa, or Kentucky, the three states with extreme policies of disenfranchising anyone with a felony conviction for life. These states are among those that also disproportionately suppress the voting rights of black people. In Florida and Kentucky, approximately one in five black citizens is disenfranchised due to a prior conviction. In Iowa, the longstanding system of disenfranchisement, paired with the worst disproportionate incarceration rate of black people in the nation, resulted in the disenfranchisement of an estimated one in four voting-age black men by 2005."""

10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“If history be our guide, then tax exemption of church property in this country is indeed highly suspect, as it arose in the early days when the church was an agency of the state… Churches, like newspapers also enjoying First Amendment rights, have no constitutional immunity from all taxes… If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith. Believers are doubtless comforted that the cause of religion is being fostered by this legislation. Yet one of the mandates of the First Amendment is to promote a viable, pluralistic society and to keep government neutral, not only between sects, but also between believers and nonbelievers. The present involvement of government in religion may seem de minimis [insignificant]. But it is, I fear, a long step down the Establishment path… I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional.”

In addition, there is an open-ended collection of e-cheating methods that can be implemented on a large scale by relatively few people, despite well monitored election-day operations.

The ostensible motivation for using e-voting stems largely from the dramatic 2000-election problems that were associated with punched card voting systems.

01	Should Terri Schiavo's Feeding Tube Have Been Removed?	"""The Schindlers [Terri Schiavo's parents] lost their case and their cause [to reinsert Terri Schiavo's feeding tube]... because in the end they were making claims the legal system has never been able or willing to recognize. They lost because they long ago ran out of good arguments to make--those arguments having been reasonably rejected by state judge after judge--and thus were left with only lame ones...   Schiavo's parents lost appeal after appeal specifically because they were asking the federal courts to declare that their constitutional rights had been violated by the Florida state court rulings in the case. They were arguing, in other words, thanks in part to their custom-made congressional legislation, that the federal Constitution gave them the right as losers in state court to get a new, full-blown trial in federal court.   If you ponder that notion you will realize just how astounding it is. If accepted, it would have meant the end of state courts as we know them. No decision at the state level ever would be final, because every losing litigant at the state court level would be able to walk into federal court and declare a federal constitutional violation...  And it is no wonder that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court decided for a fourth time to stay out of the case. This harsh reality won't make it any easier for the Schindlers, but government cannot run on passion or emotion or sympathy.

It seems to me that, as with opposition based on whether the physician is 'active,' the argument that physicians should be only 'healers' focuses too much on the physician, and not enough on the patient. When healing is no longer possible, when death is imminent and patients find their suffering unbearable, then the physician’s role should shift from healing to relieving suffering in accord with the patient’s wishes. Still, no physician should have to comply with a request to assist a terminally ill patient to die, just as no patient should be coerced into making such a request.

King Hubbert used in predicting in 1956 that United States oil production would peak during the early 1970's. These geologists indicated that world oil output would reach its apex in this decade - some 30 to 40 years after the peak in American oil production. Almost no one paid attention.  I used to work with Mr. Hubbert at Shell Oil, and my own independent research places the peak of world oil production late this year [2005] or early in 2006...  A permanent drop in world oil production will have serious consequences. In addition to the economic blow, there will be the psychological effect of accepting that there are limits to an important energy resource. What can we do? More efficient diesel automobiles, and greater reliance on wind and nuclear power, are well-engineered solutions that are available right now. Conservation, although costly in most cases, will have the largest impact. The United States also has a 300-year supply of coal, and methods for using coal without adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere are being developed.  After world oil production starts to decline, a small group of geologists could gather in my living room and all claim to have discovered the peak. 'We told you so,' we could say. But that isn't the point…The problem we need to face is the impending world oil shortage."""

10	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Whether based on theoretical or historical comparisons, the gold standard appears less likely to deliver superior price stability than the current system. Rather, money supply would be determined by the vagaries of the global gold market, which would only coincide with domestic economic needs by chance. Even if gold markets were perfectly stable, the gold standard would likely induce a damaging level of deflation. It was precisely the unwillingness of the U.S. to undertake such a destructive monetary policy that lead to the 1971 collapse of the ‘gold exchange standard’ operated under Bretton Woods. Instead, the money supply continued to grow to support moderate inflation, which undermined the tie to gold.”
10	Can Marijuana Help AIDS/HIV Patients?	relationship between marijuana smoking and the natural course of AIDS is of particular concern because HIV patients are the largest group who report using marijuana for medical purposes. Marijuana use has been linked both to increased risk of progression to AIDS in HIV-seropositive patients and to increased mortality in AIDS patients. The most compelling concerns regarding marijuana smoking in HIV/AIDS patients are the possible effects of marijuana on immunity. Reports of opportunistic fungal and bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients who used marijuana suggest that marijuana smoking either suppresses the immune system or exposes patients to an added burden of pathogens. In summary, patients with preexisting immune deficits due to AIDS should be expected to be vulnerable to serious harm caused by smoking marijuana. The relative contribution of marijuana smoke versus THC or other cannabinoids is not known.”

The right to vote has been jealously guarded since the founding of the United States.  It has taken constitutional amendments and legislative acts for all groups to be granted the right to vote, and thereby recognized as full citizenships. Legally, African-Americans have achieved the status of citizen. Practically, African-Americans have to continue to fight obstacles set up to deny their citizenship. Historically, in a number of United States' jurisdictions, African-Americans have had to challenge poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, whites-only primaries, and felon disenfranchisement laws, all designed to prohibit them from voting and thus negate their citizenship.  All of the other forms of disenfranchisement have fallen by the wayside, save one — felon disenfranchisement laws."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“There are two main arguments against using standardized tests to guarantee that students reach at least a basic level of academic competency. The first is radical: These tests are not necessary. The second—less radical and more familiar—is that, even if standardized testing were an efficient benchmark of basic skills, the costs associated with it are too high. [W]e don’t learn much from standardized testing, and we have lost a great deal by giving it so much prominence. The common core is at risk for failure, not because the standards are bad per se, but because with standardized accountability, as in so many partial reforms, we again won’t get a real picture of achievement, people will be disappointed, and the standards and testing will run their course.”

American Civil Liberties Union is a monster… There is no question that the ACLU has distracted the Scouts from singly pursuing its mission in recent years.

The Boy Scouts of America has not changed — it clings to the same principles it did at its founding in 1910 — but the legal and moral culture has changed dramatically… The Boy Scouts are feeling the weight of that change. The ACLU is the pressure agent, and the Boy Scouts realize the options: either give in or spend millions of dollars in the court of law and of public opinion defending the presence of chartered troops in America’s public schools… If the Boy Scouts follow through with early plans to undo public school sponsorships, the ACLU will reach new heights of power in the American legal system.

When a court issues an opinion that challenges a majority view, why can't it be an occasion for self-reflection, rather than outrage?  Belonging to a majority is a privilege. As the saying goes, there is safety in numbers. With that safety should come a measure of humility. Rather than triumphantly proclaiming that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is out of step with the beliefs of most Americans, the public should use the safety of their numbers to take a serious look at the claim that this parent has made on behalf of his daughter.

It pays benefits to spouses, including divorced spouses, and dependent children, not only at retirement, but also in the event of disability or death. Even highly paid workers who die or become disabled at age 30 would not have had time to save much. Many of those families would be destitute without Social Security. Its benefits are increased annually to offset inflation, so they don’t erode over time. Social Security has stood the test of time.

Social Security should be expanded, not cut and certainly not privatized.”
10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“I’m not a vegetarian because I enjoy eating meat, meat is nutritious food, and I believe there are ways to eat meat that are in keeping with my environmental and ethical values. I don’t make the decision to eat meat lightly. Meat-eating has always been a messy business, shadowed by the shame of killing… Forgetting, or willed ignorance, is the preferred strategy of many beef eaters, a strategy abetted by the industry. (What grocery-store item is more silent about its origins than a shrink-wrapped steak?)… Meat eating may have become an act riddled with moral and ethical ambiguities, but eating a steak at the end of a short, primordial food chain comprising nothing more than ruminants and grass and sunlight is something I’m happy to do and defend. The same is true for a pastured chicken or hog. When obtained from small farms where these animals are treated well, fed an appropriate diet, and generally allowed to express their creaturely character, I think the benefits of eating such meat outweigh the cost. A truly sustainable agriculture will involve animals, in order to complete the nutrient cycle, and those animals are going to be killed and eaten. That said, I have the ultimate respect for vegetarians and vegans. For they have actually done the work of thinking through the consequences of their eating decisions, something most of the rest of us have not done. My own examination of those consequences has led me to the conclusion that eating a small amount of meat from certain kinds of farms is something I can feel good about. But we all have to decide this question for ourselves, and different people will come to different conclusions, depending on their values.”
10	Does Marijuana Cause Depression or Other Mood Disorders?	surprising number of people so afflicted [with bi-polar disorder] have independently made the discovery that cannabis has improved their conditions, whether the mania or depression. It may also reduce side effects of other drugs used in its treatment, such as Lithium, Carbamazepine (Tegretol) or Valproate (Depakote). No doubt, cannabis is affecting the balance of neurotransmitters that are at the basis for this disorder. Endocannabinoids seem to be intimately involved in emotional regulation mechanisms in the limbic system. Because THC and other chemicals in cannabis mimic our own internal biochemistry, they may help replace what is missing.”
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“The best system, as always, is the one that maintains the greatest stability of currency value, over a week, month, year, decade, or century. It should also be easy to implement and cause no disruption on its introduction. As for accomplishing this task, even today there are no serious challengers to a gold standard, not even in the form of a proposal, and certainly none that have weathered the test of history. There is no reason to discard the hard-won knowledge of generations of human experience. The hard-money system of the future will be based on gold, just as were the hard-money systems of the past… A return to hard money would eliminate, as much as is possible, the monetary distortion of the price information that guides the actions of the citizenry. Success and failure would once again be determined by relative merit in the market economy, not by erratic changes in the value of the currency. Capital would be deployed more accurately, and productivity would increase… As the political tide flows away from soft money and toward hard money, when the wheel has turned once again as it has so many times in the past, the economic intelligentsia will sense the change and produce a flood of rationalizations about why the world needs a gold standard, just as they now produce a flood of rationalizations about why the world does not.”
10	Are Electronic Voting Machines Accessible to Disabled Voters?	"""It is not acceptable to accommodate some of the disabled community and expect the rest of us to live with 'business as usual.' That is discrimination, and it is not legal. Accommodating people with differing disabilities requires great flexibility in an accessible voting machine. What works for the visually or hearing or cognitively impaired does not necessarily work for people with mobility impairments. That is one specific shortcoming with the touch-screen machines which have been under consideration in Volusia County [Florida]. People with limited use of their hands and arms may not be able to use the touch-screens. Quadriplegics (people who are disabled from the neck downward like the late actor Christopher Reeve) cannot use a touch-screen in the same way as someone who has use of their hands."""

10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Few would dispute the Palestinian entitlement to a state, but it simply cannot be achieved given the present reality. It was always folly to pursue the two-state solution in a context that militated against its ever happening. Today's Israel-Palestine is demonstrably one state, impossible to divide. But it is a discriminatory state operating an apartheid-style system against the Palestinians with impunity. Gross economic inequality is one indicator of this system.   This situation demands a new Palestinian strategy, a Plan B that converts the Palestinian struggle for two states into one for equal rights within what is now a unitary state ruled by Israel. The first step in this plan requires a dismantlement of the PA as currently constituted, or at least a change of direction for the Palestinian leadership…  The PA's new relationship with Israel should be restricted to pursuing the rights of its occupied people, including the right to political resistance. The PA should lead the campaign to prepare Palestinians for the abandonment of the two-state idea and the struggle for equal rights instead. Without a middleman to hide behind, the reality of Israel's occupation will be exposed, and the logic of a civil rights struggle will be inarguable."""

01	Does Clemency Serve as a Safeguard in Capital Punishment Cases?	"""We believe that clemency serves a purpose as it is presently constructed in California and elsewhere. Although there are tremendous variations from Governor to Governor and state to state, the concept of clemency as a nonjudicial process that allows for the consideration of any type of issue is a safety valve in the overall criminal justice system. If standards and procedures are adopted, there are likely to be issues that would be precluded from the process. Moreover, the more specific the requirements, the more likely there are to be judicial challenges to the process. One enduring attribute of clemency is to provide a forum outside of the judicial process. This nonjudicial characteristic has allowed Governors to consider issues that could not be raised in court, such as the battered women's syndrome before the evidence was admissible in court.  This means, though, that clemency should not be the primary avenue for handling claims of innocence, mental deterioration on death row, or any other issue on which there is a need for a guaranteed form of review. Instead, clemency should be viewed as an extra safeguard in addition to a functioning criminal justice judicial system."""
01	Is There an Ethical Difference Between Using Performance Enhancing Drugs and Using Performing Enhancing Technologies in Nutrition, Training, and Equipment?	"""Tiger Woods used LASIK to improve his vision to 20/15 -- meaning he can see at 20 feet, what the average person can only see at 15. Mark McGwire wore specially-designed contact lenses that improved his vision to 20/10. Is this any less cheating than using a supplement or drug that was legal at the time (i.e., andro)?  On the one hand, such corrective surgery can be distinguished from using performance-enhancing drugs and supplements. Surgical techniques, rehabilitation options, nutrition and diets, weight training, equipment: all are technologies that have made sports far different games from 50 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Is surgery that enhances vision all that different from new surgical techniques that can help prevent major damage to aging joints? How different is it to pay a doctor to fine-tune your eyes versus paying personal trainers and nutritionists to fine-tune your body? In contrast, drugs such as steroids produce unnatural levels of hormones in the body so as to move past mere 'fine-tuning.'  Second, and perhaps more important, is the 'role model' difference. Professional sports (and legislative bodies) are concerned not as much with the prospect of 'cheating' in athletic competition, and more with the danger that younger athletes will follow the example of the pros. Use of performance-enhancing drugs among high school athletes has been well-documented in the past few months, which indicates the ease in which they can be obtained. Teenagers can also walk into nutrition stores and emerge with a number of dietary supplements, not all of which are free from side effects. At this time, however, corrective eye surgery is not easy to obtain. The procedure is costly (several thousand dollars) and not all doctors will perform it on someone with good vision. In addition, most (reputable) doctors will hesitate, if not refuse, to perform a surgical procedure on a minor without parental permission."""

What of advanced training by teams of sports physiologists who wire athletes to equipment monitoring heart, muscle, brain and nerves to optimise activity; or teams of sports psychologists improving your responses and neutralising those observed in competitors? What of dieticians tampering with foods and additives - drugs by any other name - to improve performance?  What is more 'fair' - the use of a team of sports specialists or a simple pill?

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“First, teachers have a greater impact on student learning than any other school-based factor. Second, we will not produce excellent schools without eliminating laws and practices that guarantee teachers – regardless of their performance – jobs for life. Nearly everyone in public education has a story that illustrates the Kafkaesque process of trying to remove a tenured teacher. Mine involves a teacher in Boston who napped each day in the back of the room while students copied from the board. Despite repeated efforts, the district failed to fire him. The time has come to eliminate tenure. We are facing monumental challenges in our quest to provide all students with an education that will prepare them to compete in a globalized economy. By removing one of the main sources of friction between labor and management, we can focus on the substantive issues: training, evaluating and rewarding teachers to make teaching a true profession.”

10	Is Sexual Orientation Determined at Birth?	Alliance and the NARTH Institute agree with the American Psychological Association that ‘biological, psychological and social factors’ shape sexual identity at an early age for most people, but the difference is one of emphasis. We place more emphasis on the psychological (family, peer and social) influences, while the American Psychological Association emphasizes biological influences–and has shown no interest in (indeed, a hostility toward) investigating those same psychological and social influences. There is no such thing as a ‘gay gene’ and there is no evidence to support the idea that homosexuality is simply genetic. However, biological influences may indeed influence some people toward homosexuality; recent studies point to prenatal-hormonal influences, especially in men, that result in a low-masculinized brain; also, there may be genetic factors in some people — both of which would affect gender identity, and therefore sexual orientation. But none of these factors mean that homosexuality is a part of human design, or that it is inevitable in such people, or that it is unchangeable. Numerous examples exist of people who have successfully modified their sexual behavior, identity, and arousal or fantasies.”

01	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""The economic advantages of the Green Economy include the macroeconomic benefits of investment in new technologies, greater productivity, improvements in the US balance of trade, and increased real disposable income across the nation…  For each alternative resource type, there are jobs created in manufacturing the necessary materials, construction of new facilities, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of those facilities…   The bulk of jobs related to wind infrastructure will come in the manufacturing of equipment. The technology of wind electricity is relatively new, but the manufacturing base for its production is very similar to past products. Every state in the country has firms and a labor force with experience making products similar to the blades, gearboxes, brakes, hubs, cooling fans, couplings, drives, cases, bearings, generators, towers and sensors that make up a wind tower. These jobs fall into the familiar durable manufacturing sectors of plastics and rubber, primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment. Cities across the country have the capacity to attract job growth in these important manufacturing sectors along the nation's path to a new energy infrastructure.  Many potential manufacturing jobs in the solar industry are high tech jobs in the Semiconductor and Related Devices subsector. Nearly one-quarter of existing jobs in this sector are in California, but many other states have a significant presence too. But solar infrastructure also requires components from more traditional sectors such plastics and rubber, fabricated metal products, and electrical equipment…  Under our chosen scenarios, renewable power generation would lead to the generation of more than 1.2 million jobs…  The potential growth in Green Jobs is significant in that it could be the fastest growing segment of the United States economy over the next several decades."""
01	Under Obamacare, Does Medicare Reduce Reimbursements to Hospitals with High 30-Day Readmission Rates? - YES	"""Reductions in hospital readmissions (also referred to as rehospitalizations) have been identified by Congress and President Obama as a source for reducing Medicare spending. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) reported that in 2005, 17.6% of hospital admissions resulted in readmissions within 30 days of discharge, 11.3% within 15 days, and 6.2% within 7 days. In addition, variation in readmission rates by hospital and geographic region suggests that some hospitals and geographic areas are better than others at containing readmission rates...  Although readmitting a patient to a hospital may be appropriate in some cases, some policy makers and researchers agree that reducing readmission rates could help contain Medicare costs and improve the quality of patient care."""
01	Would Legal Prostitution Decrease Sexually Transmitted Diseases?	"""For too long there has been an assumption in the literature that because sex workers have multiple sexual partners they are automatically a health risk rather than framing the possibility that their access to a hard to reach population of male clients could present a gateway for information transfer and behaviour change...   The evidence of the legalised brothel system in Nevada highlights that sex work environments that are legitimated and bureaucratised have the effect of empowering sex workers to control their working conditions and interactions with clients. A legalised system that shared the responsibility for safe sexual practices with male clients and management as well as sex workers could facilitate the role of health education both informally and formally... Only when the place of prostitution in society is not considered the plight of the immoral or destitute, but a fixed feature of sexual behaviour, will policy move from the tone of moral disapproval or public nuisance to a realistic perspective that facilitates the provision of safe sexual services as work."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	"Using test scores to reward and punish teachers and schools encourages them to cheat the system for their own gain. [117] A 2011 USA Today investigation of six states and Washington DC found 1,610 suspicious anomalies in year-over-year test score gains. [26] A confidential Jan. 2009 memo, prepared for the DC school system by an outside analyst and uncovered in Apr. 2013, revealed that 191 teachers in 70 DC public schools were ""implicated in possible testing infractions,"" and nearly all the teachers at one DC elementary school ""had students whose test papers showed high numbers of wrong-to-right erasures,"" according to USA Today. [155] 178 Atlanta public school teachers and administrators from 44 schools were found to be cheating on standardized tests according to a July 2011 state report. At one school, teachers attended ""weekend pizza parties"" to correct students' answers, according to ABC News.

10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	"The accusation that Social Security has been “raided” by the federal government is misleading and does not provide a justification for privatizing the program.

10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“In this particular case [the Emanuel AME church shooting in Charleston, SC], the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn’t fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do. We don’t need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job. Because that person [Dylann Roof], should not have gotten a gun, should not — would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens… I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn’t law-abiding gun owners. Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you’re going away. You’re going away for a long, long while.”

"""There is a conflict in the Middle East between two entities, and they're both right, each in their own way. This is our only home, and therefore all kinds of solutions can be found. One could establish a system in one state in which Judea and Samaria are jointly held. The Jews would vote for a Jewish parliament and the Palestinians for an Arab parliament, and we would create a system in which life is shared. But these are things that will take time. Anyone who thinks that there are shortcuts is talking nonsense. As long as Islamic fundamentalism thinks that Jews are forbidden to settle in the Holy Land, we have a problem. It will not be resolved by an agreement, even if we obtain a promise from all the Arab states that it will be fine.  So if people say to me: Decide one state or division of the Land of Israel, I say that division is the bigger danger."""
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“By striking down laws that forced women to resort to back-alley abortion, Roe saved many women’s lives… Since abortion was legalized in 1973, the safety of the procedure has increased dramatically. The number of deaths per 100,000 legal abortion procedures declined from 4.1 to 0.6 between 1973 and 1997. In addition, Roe has improved the quality of many women’s lives. Although most women welcome pregnancy, childbirth, and the responsibilities of raising a child at some period in their lives, few events can more dramatically constrain a woman’s opportunities than an unplanned pregnancy. Because childbirth and pregnancy substantially affect a woman’s educational prospects, employment opportunities, and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws narrowly circumscribed women’s role in society and hindered women from charting their paths through life in the most basic of ways. In the 40 years since Roe, the variety and level of women’s achievements have reached unprecedented heights.”
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""Do we want a hateful, vengeful society, one that turns its back on its children and then executes them, that denies its mentally ill the treatment and the medicine they need and then puts them to death when demons are no longer kept at bay... If we here in the United States examine our own system, face its flaws, and think about what kind of society we want to have, we will ultimately conclude that, like slavery and segregation, the death penalty is a relic of another era, that it represents the dark side of the human spirit, and that we are capable of more constructive approaches to the problem of crime in our society. And we will then join the rest of the civilized world in making permanent, absolute and unequivocal the injunction 'Thou Shall Not Kill.'”"

This week, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office revealed that 1,036 of the plans offered under Obamacare, and eligible for taxpayer subsidies, cover abortion on demand. Although the President promised in 2009 that no federal dollars would be used to fund abortions, the law's accounting gimmicks showed otherwise...  Clearly, there's been a lack of full disclosure by the administration and the insurance companies who have ignored the law, a law which failed to provide adequate safeguards for the taxpayer. Many Americans are thus unwittingly paying for a procedure which violates their most deeply held beliefs."""
10	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""History has seen attempts to commodify land, food, labor, forests, water, genes and ideas. Carbon trading (emissions trading) and carbon offsets follow in the footsteps of this history and turn Mother Earth's carbon-cycling capacity into property to be bought or sold in a national and global market. Through this process of creating a new commodity – carbon (CO2) - the Earth's ability and capacity to support a climate conducive to life and human societies is now passing into the same corporate hands that are destroying the climate. Promoters of carbon trading and carbon offset regimes support capitalism as the solution to drive environmental change and innovation to address climate change...  The Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) has consulted with indigenous spiritual people, from the North and South, about the proposals to put a price on air (carbon), to privatize the atmosphere (property rights of the air), and about a world that will have governments and corporations selling, bartering and trading carbon and other greenhouse gases. Once the idea of carbon trading and carbon offsets have been thoroughly explained (which has not been easy and rarely done adequately by pro-carbon trading/offset profiteers, brokers and political supporters), many Indigenous Peoples have said it is a 'corruption of the sacred'. To participate in this carbon trading/offset schemes violates indigenous traditional knowledge and our Indigenous Original Instructions or spirituality (cosmovision) consciousness."""

10	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""Cap and trade is nothing more than a massive energy tax...  The goal of cap and trade is to drive up the costs of energy in order for people to use less of it...  The alleged benefit from cap and trade is that the regulations will reduce carbon dioxide emissions enough to slow warming and reduce global temperatures...  According to climatologist Chip Knappenberger, Waxman-Markey [American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009] would moderate temperatures by only hundredths of a degree in 2050 and no more than two-tenths of a degree at the end of the century. Even EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson concurred, recently saying, 'I believe the central parts of the [EPA] chart are that U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2 levels.'  A multilateral approach would not fare much better. In the case of international cooperation, India, China, and the rest of the developing world would have to revert to their 2000 levels of CO2 emissions by 2050. On a per-capita basis, China would backtrack to about one-tenth of what the U.S. emitted in 2000. India and most of the developing world would have to drop to even lower levels. This scenario, in addition to being highly unlikely, would de-develop the developing world...  It is important to remember that everything policymakers have promised this bill will do will in fact do the opposite. Cap and trade will drive up energy costs for years to come, resulting in economic pain and higher unemployment."""
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	"Modern abortion procedures are safe and do not cause lasting health issues such as cancer and infertility. A peer-reviewed study published by Obstetrics & Gynecology reported that less than one quarter of one percent of abortions lead to major health complications.

10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“Facts, common sense and numerous studies all refute the claim that there is a link between video games and violence. Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night. Numerous authorities have examined the scientific record and found that it does not establish any causal link between media content and real-life violence… * Violent crime, particularly among the young, has decreased dramatically since the early 1990s. During the same period of time, video games have steadily increased in popularity and use, exactly the opposite of what one would expect if there were a causal link. * Many games with violent content sold in the U.S. – and some with far more violence – are also sold in foreign markets. However, the level of violent crime in these foreign markets is considerably lower than that in the U.S., suggesting that influences such as the background of the individual, the availability of guns and other factors are more relevant to understanding the cause of any particular crime… * The truth is, there is no scientific research that validates a link between computer and video games and violence, despite lots of overheated rhetoric from the industry’s detractors. Instead, a host of respected researchers has concluded that there is no link between media violence and violent crime.”

There might be worse ideas than this, but they generally involve jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge because everybody else is doing it… Economics is often a contentious subject, but economists agree about the gold standard – it is a barbarous relic that belongs in the dustbin of history… It prevents the central bank from fighting recessions by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have – which, in turn, depends on our trade balance and on how much of the shiny rock we can dig up… Why would anyone want to go back to the bad old days? The gold standard limited central banks from printing money when economies needed central banks to print money, and limited governments from running deficits when economies needed governments to run deficits. It was a devilish device for turning recessions into depressions… Prices would have to fall a great deal if we adopted the gold standard today. In other words, it would turn the imagined problem of price stability into a real problem of price stability. And, of course, this ensuing deflation would send the economy into a death spiral due to still high levels of household debt.”

In adults the problems seemed centered more around heart disease and arthritis, allergy, sinusitis, and the more serious questions of leukemia, lymphoma and cancer...   Any lactating mammal excretes toxins through her milk.

Any Palestinian state would have to be demilitarized, and who, really, would accept that—that's not sovereignty, that's (at best) autonomy, and if you're going to be merely autonomous, why even uphold the fiction of statehood?  Think about it: If you had been militarily occupied and attacked for years by the same country, would you accept a 'sovereign' state which had no ability to defend itself?

Proponents of legalization argue that all attempts to deal with the sex business have failed and the only option left untried is decriminalization...   Legalized prostitution creates the same problems that legalized marijuana does. While prostitution is legal, forced prostitution is not. The latter occurs, and the new German law unintentionally makes it harder to hunt down human traffickers, especially from Eastern Europe and Africa. Similarly, it is harder to combat under-aged prostitution. With legalized marijuana and prostitution, Amsterdam became a magnet for human traffickers, drug traders and petty criminals.

She never gets in trouble. She has command of her life, and her clients. The ones who get into the surveys have drug problems or psychological problems. They're the ones who were sexually abused.

To be prostituted is humiliating enough; to legalise prostitution is to condone that humiliation, and to absolve those who inflict it. It is an agonising insult."""
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“As a former college president, I have joined with many of my colleagues to advocate lowering the minimum drinking age from 21 to 18, because we believe the 21-year-old limit has created, rather than solved, problems. America’s earlier experiment with prohibition was a notorious failure. Yet in 1984, America again enacted prohibition on a more limited scale, becoming one of only a handful of nations in the world with a minimum drinking age of 21. I believe that our 30 years of experience with prohibition for young people has been a serious failure as well. There are a number of arguments against the 21-year minimum age. Foremost, in my mind, is the dramatic rise in binge drinking among young people since the 1984 change — with its consequent danger to health and safety. When it is legal for an 18-year-old to drive, marry or serve in the military but illegal for him or her to drink a beer, the illogic of the situation is patent. As a result, the overwhelming response of young people has been, not compliance, but contempt for the law. By outlawing moderate use of alcohol in appropriate social contexts and with adult oversight, we have driven more drinking underground, where it has taken the very dangerous form of ‘pre-gaming.’ The ‘under-age’ drinker, no longer permitted the occasional beer during a dance party, is now more likely to chug high-octane alcohol in dangerous quantities before heading off to that party. As a result, alcohol use has become more, not less, dangerous.”
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""There are good reasons to maintain capital punishment in our state...  The paramount goal of sentencing is the imposition of justice.

A drug cartel member who murders a rival cartel member faces life in prison without parole. What if he murders two, three, or 12 people? Or the victim is a child or multiple children? What if the murder was preceded by torture or rape? How about a serial killer? Or a terrorist who kills dozens, hundreds or thousands?  The repeal of the death penalty treats all murders as the same. Once a person commits a single act of murder, each additional murder is a freebie.  That is not justice."""

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“In the year 2015, a job has got to lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. It has got to be increased to a living wage! That means raising the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour! That means closing the loophole that allows employers to pay tipped workers a shamefully low $2.13 an hour! And that means demanding that Senate contractors and federal contractors pay all of their workers a living wage with affordable healthcare, decent benefits and the right to collectively bargain! And that’s exactly why we are here today. Today, more than half of all African American workers and nearly 60 percent of Latino workers make less than $15 an hour. That is unacceptable!”
01	Has Legalizing Medical Marijuana Led to Increased Drug Abuse among Children and Adolescents?	medical marijuana in Montana will send the wrong message to kids about drug use. The debate is about our kids. The debate is about the greater good for our society and what kind of message we’re sending. And we don’t need to go out of our way to help our kids get addicted to drugs… If kids see marijuana as a medicine, they’re apt to dismiss its harms. Among those are effects on the respiratory system and impaired judgment… If we make it acceptable in society to smoke dope, our children are more inclined to do that.”
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""The studies reviewed in this report indicate that alternatives cannot provide significant amounts of liquid fuels. Thus it is not feasible to ramp up alternatives to replace oil, even if there are decades to prepare for the occurrence of Peak Oil. There are no significant mitigation options on the supply side regarding the Peak Oil crisis...  Solar power, nuclear energy, and coal are primarily useful for generating electric power, but these energies do not provide liquid fuels needed for transportation or mechanized agriculture, nor do they provide raw materials for manufacturing of 300,000 products, including fertilizer. Electric power from solar, coal, nuclear fission, or nuclear fusion will therefore not solve the nation's energy problems...  Because leaders lack a basic understanding of energy sources, the nation will continue to direct attention toward the hydrogen economy, corn ethanol, wind power, and solar energy – even though the most authoritative sources conclude that these are not solutions for the liquid fuels problems facing the nation."""
10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“The right to bear arms is inherent in the right of self defense, defense of the family, and defense against tyranny, conferred on the individual and the community by our Creator to safeguard life, liberty, and property, as well as to help preserve the independence of the nation. The right to keep and bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution; it may not properly be infringed upon or denied. The Constitution Party upholds the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. We oppose attempts to prohibit ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens, and stand against all laws which would require the registration of guns or ammunition. We emphasize that when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have them. In such circumstances, the peaceful citizen’s protection against the criminal would be seriously jeopardized. We call for the repeal of all federal firearms legislation, beginning with Federal Firearms Act of 1968. We call for the rescinding of all executive orders, the prohibition of any future executive orders, and the prohibition of treaty ratification which would in any way limit the right to keep and bear arms.”
01	Is Legal Prostitution a Legitimate Business?	"""There appears to be a legitimate place for commercial sex in conservative and religious parts of Europe--in Turkey, Portugal, Italy, for instance...   With the underlying assumption that women do not choose to work in prostitution but only use it as a 'survival strategy,' only the extreme ends of coercive prostitution are described...   This one dimensional approach reflects a wider political hypocrisy that accepts and promotes the idea that some parts of a woman's sexuality can be legitimately used as employment, while other aspects are labelled as an immoral or inappropriate use of the body...   [I]t is accepted and encouraged that femininity should be expressed in a certain way...Sex work is not considered a service industry, because the idea of sexual services is viewed through a different lens due to the inherent Christian, middle-class morals attached to the act of sex, as something that is only rightly expressed in heterosexual, monogamous, reproductive relationships."""
01	Do Senior Citizens Feel Comfortable Using Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Some groups have attempted to argue that senior citizens are intimidated by electronic voting systems.

10	Do Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide Violate the Hippocratic Oath?	"""In Roe [v. Wade], the Court cited a scholar's conclusion that the Hippocratic Oath 'originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians.' The Court stressed the Oath's 'rigidity' and was not deterred by its prohibitory language regarding abortion. As Roe shows, a literalist reading of the Hippocratic Oath does not represent the best or final word on medical or legal controversies today. Were we to adhere to the rigid language of the oath, not only would doctors be barred from performing abortions or helping terminally ill patients hasten their deaths, but according to a once-accepted interpretation, they would also be prohibited from performing any type of surgery at all, a position that would now be recognized as preposterous by even the most tradition-bound AMA members."""

And, of course, they do. Randall Kennedy, an African-American Harvard Law School professor, and Professor Michael Tonry, a leading liberal expert on sentencing, acknowledge the high rate of black street crime.   The fact is that capital criminals don’t look like America, and no one should expect them to. No one is surprised to find more men than women in this class. Nor is it a shock to find that this group contains more twenty-year-olds than septuagenarians. And if — as the left tirelessly maintains — poverty breeds crime, and if — as it tiresomely maintains — the poor are disproportionately minority, then it must follow — as the left entirely denies — that minorities will be 'overrepresented' among criminals."""

And if Congress had been asked, based on what we know now, we never would have agreed, given the lack of a long-term plan, paltry international support, the proven absence of weapons of mass destruction, and the reallocation of troops and resources that might have been used in Afghanistan to eliminate Bin Laden and al Qaeda, and fully uproot the Taliban."""
10	Should the US Congress Be Involved in Setting Drug Policies for Professional Sports?	"""I believe that the NBA's current anti-drug program is strong, effective, and appropriate for our sport, and remain committed to ensuring that it remains state-of-the-art. I am confident that any necessary modifications to our program can be made through the collective bargaining process with the Players Association, as we have successfully done in the past. Indeed, a drug program that is the product of agreement between management and labor will always be superior to one that is imposed from the outside, as the parties to the agreement will be invested, as we are, in its success.  For this reason, federal legislation in this area is not necessary for the NBA. Nor do I believe that a uniform, federally-mandated approach to drug testing for all sports leagues would be appropriate. For example, while we believe it is important to prohibit a broad list of performance-enhancing substances, as we do in our Program, we do not believe that the entire WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency] list of prohibited substances is right for the NBA. Similarly, while stiff penalties are necessary for the legitimacy of any anti-drug program, we believe that the penalties contained in our labor contract - and not the excessive penalties that were previously proposed by Congress - are fair and appropriate for our sport.   And finally, we do not believe that the involvement of an entity like WADA will improve our Program in any respect. As discussed above, the NBA's Program is already managed by independent entities and individuals with substantial expertise and integrity.   Moreover, because the NBA and the Players Association jointly created our Program, NBA players have confidence in its legitimacy and impartiality, and that trust is critical to making the Program run smoothly."""
01	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Health care is a basic human right. Providing the care needed to maintain health, prevent disease, and restore health after injury or illness is a responsibility each person owes others and government owes to all, a responsibility government ignores at its peril. In Ezekiel 34:4a, God points out the failures of the leadership of Israel to care for the weak: ‘You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured.’ As a result all suffer… The right to health care includes care for persons with brain diseases, neurological conditions, or physical disabilities, who must be afforded the same access to health care as all other persons in our communities. It is unjust to construct or perpetuate barriers to physical or mental wholeness or full participation in community. We believe it is a governmental responsibility to provide all citizens with health care.”

I wanna be on record, and I know that this would not even be agreeable to some of you, because there are many Republicans who think that the two-state solution is in fact a solution. I consider it no solution whatsoever. There cannot be two states polling for the same piece of real estate especially when one of those states does not believe the other one even has a right to exist much less exist peacefully.   [Y]ou can't have two governments wanting to own the same piece of real estate, so why don't we leave it in the hands of the government to whom it was originally given and why don't we leave it into the hands of those who will protect not only the antiquities but respect the religions, not only of the Jews, but also of the Muslims, and of the Christians."""
01	Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis?	"""Osteoporotic low bone mineral density often leads to fractures, costly hospitalization, and prolonged use of health services. Milk accounts for about half of all dietary calcium intake in North America and the importance of calcium in milk for attaining peak bone mass and preventing osteoporosis may relate to the quantity consumed during specific life periods. In this paper, we report the association of lifetime milk consumption with bone mineral density in a community based cohort of older women.  The observed relation between bone mineral density and post adolescent milk consumption is consistent with evidence that a calcium-rich diet during adulthood contributes to peak bone mass and/or helps minimize bone loss.  This study lends further support to the importance of milk in the preservation of bone in women."""

01	Should Net Neutrality Be Restored? - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Net neutrality preserves free speech on the internet by prohibiting internet service providers from blocking content. ISPs may slow or block websites that disagree with the companies' political viewpoints or interfere with their monetary interests. [2][7] FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel stated that the removal of net neutrality rules will give ISPs ""extraordinary new power"" and allow them ""to censor online content."" [8] According to the 2014 D.C. Circuit court ruling, Verizon v. FCC, the power of ISPs to censor content is not ""merely theoretical."" Before net neutrality was in place, instances of content censorship actually occurred, including two separate instances of broadband ISPs blocking access to voice over IP applications, and one instance of an ISP blocking an online payment service. [15] In 2014, President Obama stated that ""an open Internet… has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known,"" and that if content is legal your ISP should not be allowed to block it. [33] The Electronic Freedom Foundation has argued that, ""the meaningful exercise of our constitutional rights—including the freedoms of speech, assembly, and press—has become dependent on broadband Internet access."" This dependency makes net neutrality rules essential for a free society. [16]"
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""Some would argue that the death penalty is needed as a means of retributive justice, to balance out the crime with the punishment. This reflects a natural concern of society, and especially of victims and their families. Yet we believe that we are called to seek a higher road even while punishing the guilty, for example through long and in some cases life-long incarceration, so that the healing of all can ultimately take place... The strongest argument of all is the deep pain and grief of the families of victims, and their quite natural desire to see punishment meted out to those who have plunged them into such agony. Yet it is the clear teaching of our traditions that this pain and suffering cannot be healed simply through the retribution of capital punishment or by vengeance."""
01	Is Drinking Milk a Good Way to Build Strong Bones?	"""Adolescence is a critical time to optimize bone health, given that approximately 50% of skeletal mass is accrued during adolescent years. In girls, 95% of total body mineral mass is accumulated by age 17 and 99% by age 27. Optimizing bone health during adolescence not only reduces future risk of osteoporosis, but also helps to prevent forearm fractures during youth...   Findings from ongoing studies indicate that four to five servings/day of calcium-rich foods such as milk and other dairy products are needed to optimize peak bone mass during adolescence. Osteoporosis is a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences. With low calcium intake levels during important bone growth periods, today's youth faces a serious public health problem in the future."""
01	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""Several of the nutrients provided by milk are important for optimal health and growth...  Flavored milks provide another option for meeting the recommended intakes of dairy products, and research in schools shows that students purchase more milk when milk offerings are enhanced and include flavored milk. Servings of plain milk and chocolate milk provide essentially identical amounts of protein, total and saturated fat, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin A, riboflavin, and potassium...  Some schools limit children's access to flavored milk presumably due to concerns that the beverages provide unhealthful levels of added sugars and fat, therefore potentially contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic. Childhood obesity is a significant concern in the United States; data collected between 2003 and 2004 indicate that 17.1% of children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years were overweight.  We are unaware of evidence that consumption of flavored milk is associated with increased risk for obesity...  Until those data are available, limiting children and adolescents' access to flavored milk due to its higher added sugars or energy content may only have the undesirable effect of further reducing intakes of many essential nutrients provided by milk."""

Voters understand that the criminals on death row have been convicted of the most heinous crimes. Voters also realize that those left behind, grieving families throughout California and their loved ones, don’t deserve anything less than justice.

01	Is the ACLU Anti-Christian?	ACLU is not anti-religion, just anti-Christian. By definition, it’s the American Civil Liberties Union. By action, it has become the Abolishing Christian Legacy Union. The ACLU will assure Muslim clerics and imams the right to pray on planes, fight for an atheist’s rights to remove a cross, stand beside pro-abortionists, help illegal aliens cross our borders, and establish rights for the sexual deviant by forming the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project, but what is it doing for Christians and Christmas censorship? While allegedly fighting against the tyranny of the majority, the ACLU itself rules religiously by litigation, lobbying, and supporting counter-culture Christian movements. So who died and appointed the ACLU as America’s religious constitutional watchdog? Membership for the ACLU is only 500,000. America’s population is 300 million. I think it’s time that we helped them feel their size! I suggest the rest of us follow the passion of Thomas Jefferson, who spoke these words that are etched on the very wall of his memorial in Washington, D.C.: ‘I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.'”
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"Raising the minimum wage would lead to a healthier population and prevent premature deaths. A 2014 Human Impact Partners study by Rajiv Bhatia, MD, found that raising the Californian minimum wage to $13 an hour by 2017 would ""significantly benefit health and well-being."" [38] The study found that those earning a higher minimum wage would have enough to eat, be more likely to exercise, less likely to smoke, suffer from fewer emotional and psychological problems, and even prevent 389 premature deaths a year. [38] A 2014 study by the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) found that minimum wage workers are more likely to report poor health, suffer from chronic diseases, and be unable to afford balanced meals. [39] The study concluded that ""policies that reduce poverty and raise the wages of low-income people can be expected to significantly improve overall health and reduce health inequities."" [39] Edward Ehlinger, MD, State Health Commissioner for Minnesota, stated that raising the Minnesotan minimum wage from $6.15 an hour to $9.50 by mid-2016 was probably ""the biggest public health achievement... in the four years I've been health commissioner...

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“In the United States, churches and other religious institutions are, generally speaking, exempt from federal, state, and local taxes. They have been for a long time. This deeply rooted practice is good policy and it helps to promote and protect our fundamental right to religious freedom. After all, that right includes the right of religious believers to act in and through religious institutions, so it makes sense to protect those institutions from the intrusions and burdens of tax laws… [O]ur tradition of exempting churches and religious institutions from taxes is justified and important. The separation of church and state is not a reason to invalidate or abandon these tax exemptions but is instead a very powerful justification for retaining them… There are also many good policy reasons for exempting churches, faith-based homeless shelters, parochial schools, and religious hospitals from taxes. Many of these reasons also apply forcefully to cultural, artistic, and social welfare agencies of all kinds. It is a good thing to have a vibrant, diverse, and competitive civil society, to support rather than resist pluralism, to increase rather than shrink the opportunities for engagement with others, and to avoid monopolization by governments of too many activities. There are things that, probably, only governments can do, but there are many more things that non-state agencies can do too, and better.”

01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Access to safe abortion is a key factor in preventing deaths and disability among women due to pregnancy-related causes. Each year, an estimated 22 million women and girls have an unsafe abortion, almost all in the developing world. As a result, 47,000 lose their lives and millions more suffer serious injury. The economic and social costs of unsafe, delayed, or illegal abortions include maternal mortality, long-term complications from damage to reproductive organs, pelvic inflammatory disease, and secondary infertility, as well as potential harm to a woman’s existing children. Countries’ health systems incur huge costs in managing these preventable injuries, and their economies suffer from diminished economic participation.”
01	Should Felons Who Have Completed Their Sentence (Incarceration, Probation, and Parole) Be Allowed to Vote?	"""In the United States today, by far the largest group of citizens who are denied the right to vote are those who have received a felony conviction... The disenfranchisement of such a large group of felons, and former felons, from participation in democratic elections threatens the health of American democracy in a number of ways...  While states have legitimate reasons to compel felons to make restitution to their victims, and to punish recidivists or violent offenders more harshly than others, there are no logical reasons for imposing disenfranchisement in such cases."""
10	Is Poor Representation by Public Defense Attorneys a Widespread Problem in Capital Cases?	"""Once the decision to seek death is solidified, the court and defense counsel are immediately notified. If a defendant does not have private defense counsel, an experienced criminal-defense attorney is appointed. California law also authorizes the judge to appoint a second defense attorney – at taxpayers’ expense – for the defendant. These attorneys are paid much higher fees than appointed attorneys in noncapital cases. Capital-case defense counsel also receive significantly more funding for investigators and other experts – and frequently spend thousands of dollars on psychiatrists, forensic scientists, criminalists, jury-selection experts, penalty-phase coordinators, and other specialists to ensure that no stone is left unturned. Defense attorneys also routinely file all manner of motions and objections to protect their clients from conviction. Attorneys know their trial tactics will be thoroughly scrutinized on appeal, so every effort is made to avoid error, ensuring yet another level of protection for the defendant.  They [death penalty opponents]... have painted a picture of incompetent defense lawyers, sleeping throughout the trial, or innocent men being executed. Their accusations receive wide media coverage, resulting in a near-daily onslaught on the death penalty. Yet, through all the hysteria, jurors continue to perform their responsibilities and return death sentences for those who would abduct, molest, and then kill our youth."""
10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“What I think is two things, number one, that restricting the right to keep and bear arms is unconstitutional. The Second Amendment is an integral part of the Bill of Rights. And what it means is, politicians cannot come and strip the guns from law-abiding Americans. But, number two, it’s misguided policy. If you look at the jurisdictions with the strictest gun control laws, almost without exception, they have the highest crime rates and the highest murder rates. If you look at the jurisdictions that most vigorously protect our right to keep and bear arms, almost without exception, they have the lowest crime rates and the lowest murder rates. Gun control policies don’t work. And they’re contrary to the Constitution.”
10	Are Sanctuary Jurisdictions (Cities, Counties, and States) Good Policy?	"""The Obama administration encouraged sanctuary cities, and President Trump is right to push in the opposite direction. The more than 300 sanctuary jurisdictions across the country release thousands of illegal immigrants subject to deportation back onto the streets every year, at a risk to public safety. Recall that the illegal immigrant who killed Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco in 2015 had seven felony convictions and had been deported five times previously; at the time of the killing, he was facing a sixth deportation order. Even as Democrats at all levels of government declare their support for deporting known criminals, sanctuary-city policies keep those individuals out of the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   More fundamentally, it is impossible to have a truly effective regime of interior enforcement if localities aren't willing to cooperate with the federal government even when it comes to illegal immigrants who have been arrested for committing crimes."""

Each and every day, people are constantly sharing, posting and tweeting. We’re becoming glued to computers, phones and tablets, always wanting to know what the people around us are doing. There are so many social media sites today, and honestly, I don’t think it’s worth the effort to try and keep up. Facebook is hands-down the number one culprit of taking our attention and causing us to live vicariously through others. We become ‘friends’ with people we don’t even know just so we can share pictures of our daily lives and like statuses that don’t even matter.

"""Citizens and community members everywhere are seeking smart solutions to our two biggest problems – the economic downturn and the ecological collapse.  The nation is finally realizing that the solutions to these twin crises are linked.

Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes and buildings don't retrofit or weatherize themselves. In our industrial society, trees don't even PLANT themselves, anymore. Real people must do all of that work...  In the long run, smart policy and investment will drive down prices for clean, renewable, homegrown energy sources. But if we cling to the old, carbon-intensive energy technologies, then the price we all pay – in volatile economic costs, in climate disruption and in threats to our national security – will continue to climb. And the poor will be hit – first and worst – by every one of those rising costs. A well thought out shift to a clean energy economy offers more work, more wealth and better health to disadvantaged communities than does any plausible, business-as-usual scenario...  In a time of economic peril, let us never forget that everything that is required to make America's economy cleaner, greener and more resilient is a career pathway for someone.

10	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Depression, Bipolar Disorders, Anxiety, and Similar Mood Disorders?	suggests that marijuana may somehow trigger schizophrenia in those who are already at risk of developing the disorder. Those with a vulnerability to develop schizophrenia, such as having a family history of the illness, should be strongly advised against using marijuana for this reason… Marijuana may seem to help ease depression before the effects of the drug wear off; however after that, smoking marijuana may make depression worse. Those who use marijuana have been shown to have higher levels of depression and depressive symptoms than those who do not use marijuana. Although results are mixed, there is a substantial amount of evidence to suggest that marijuana use, particularly frequent or heavy use, predicts depression later in life. Young women appear to be more likely to experience this effect. Marijuana can lead to symptoms of anxiety, such as panic, in the short-term, but there is a lack of evidence pointing to marijuana as an important risk factor for chronic anxiety disorders… Again, if someone has a genetic vulnerability or has an existing mental health issues, marijuana should be avoided.”
01	Is Life in Prison without Parole a Better Option Than the Death Penalty?	"""For those in favour of LWOP [life in prison without parole], another key benefit is its retributive power. It is argued that murderers deserve to be so punished because of the heinous nature of their crimes. If the death penalty is to be abolished, a replacement sanction of sufficient gravity needs to be provided by law. Proponents in the United States have emphasized that ‘life without parole is certainly not a lenient sentence ’ (Blair 1994:198). Sometimes referred to as ‘death by incarceration ’ , such sentences are undeniably tough, pleasing both politicians and prosecutors, but also satisfying some opponents of the death penalty...  Deterrence is seen to be another major strength of LWOP. Some abolitionists have put forward the argument that while reviewable life sentences offer little in the way of deterring those who might kill, LWOP is undeniably harsh and its deterrent effect should not be underestimated."""

It was Rony Adam, the head of UN department of Israeli Foreign Ministry who presided over the UN Committee for Program and Coordination.   Moreover, in 2005, Israel was given the deputy chairmanship of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. In the same year, Permanent Representative to the UN and Israel's Ambassador, Dan Gillerman, was elected as one of the 21 vice presidents of the General Assembly…  The United Nations has also considered issues that concern Israel and the Jewish community, particularly the ones related to Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism.

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“[A]s a practitioner who has dealt with several former vegetarians and vegans (total vegetarians), I know full well the dangerous effects of a diet devoid of healthful animal products… The mainstream health and vegetarian media have done such an effective job of ‘beef bashing,’ that most people think there is nothing healthful about meat, especially red meat. In reality, however, animal flesh foods like beef and lamb are excellent sources of a variety of nutrients as any food/nutrient table will show. Nutrients like vitamins A, D, several of the B-complex, essential fatty acids (in small amounts), magnesium, zinc, phosphorous, potassium, iron, taurine, and selenium are abundant in beef, lamb, pork, fish and shellfish, and poultry. Nutritional factors like coenzyme Q10, carnitine, and alpha-lipoic acid are also present. Some of these nutrients are only found in animal foods–plants do not supply them… [I]t is often claimed that, since eating meat involves the taking of a life, it is somehow tantamount to murder… Modern peoples (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) have lost touch with what it takes to survive in our world… When Native Americans killed a game animal for food, they would routinely offer a prayer of thanks to the animal’s spirit for giving its life so that they could live. In our world, life feeds off life. Destruction is always balanced with generation. This is a good thing: unchecked, the life force becomes cancerous. If animal food consumption is viewed in this manner, it is hardly murder, but sacrifice. Modern peoples would do well to remember this.”

[11] [12] According to Karl Eschbach, PhD, DACA will increase the undocumented population because those who don't qualify for DACA will stay in the hopes of qualifying eventually, and more people will immigrate assuming coverage by DACA or a similar program. [13] Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) stated, ""The Dream Act will only encourage more illegal immigration. One only needs to look at history to see how amnesty has played out in the past. The 1986 amnesty legislation legalized about three million illegal immigrants. But rather than put an end to illegal immigration, the amnesty only encouraged more. There are at least 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S."" [14] The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) included the legalization of about three million undocumented immigrants. Following the act's implementation, between 1990 and 2007, illegal immigration grew by 8.5 million. [13]"

01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“My belated respect for [Reagan] grew from appreciating his boldness in dealing with the three miseries of the modern era – one terrifying, the other crippling, the third inhibiting. The first abomination was a suicidal nuclear arms race of such potential massive destruction that it threatened the world with extinction; the second, an expanding welfare state that had made the poor helplessly dependent, reduced them to debilitating objects of pity, and destroyed any hope for self-esteem; the third, a joyless religious inheritance that told people their kingdom was not of this world and they needed to be careful about pursuing happiness in case they came to enjoy it. Reagan, it is now clear, delivered America from fear and loathing. He stood for freedom, peace, disarmament, self-reliance, eartlhy happiness, the dreams of the imagination and the desires of the heart.”

School districts from Washington D.C. to Los Angeles have begun to use VA to evaluate teachers. Proponents argue that using VA can improve student achievement… while critics argue that test score gains are poor proxies for a teacher’s true quality… We find that students assigned to higher VA teachers are more successful in many dimensions. They are more likely to attend college, earn higher salaries, live in better neighborhoods, and save more for retirement. They are also less likely to have children as teenagers…”

While the estimates of how much the minimum wage should be increased vary, many economists agree that if it had kept pace with rising productivity and incomes, it would be higher than the current $7.25 an hour. According to a study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), the federal minimum wage would have been $21.72 per hour in 2012, instead of $7.25, if the minimum wage had kept pace with increases in productivity since 1968. [17] The Institute for Policy Studies estimated in 2012 that personal income has grown by 100.6% since 1968, while the minimum wage has stagnated: ""If our standard for minimum wages had kept pace with overall income growth in the American economy, it would now be $21.16 per hour."" [14] The Economist stated in 2015 that ""America as a whole is an outlier among advanced economies... one would expect America, where GDP per person is $53,000, to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour.

01	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	“To expand their economies and increase employment, most developed countries are restructuring their corporate tax systems and reducing their corporate tax rates. To date, the United States has taken an opposite approach that has yielded one of the most complex and un-competitive corporate tax structures in the industrialized world. Its effects are troublesome: outsourced economic activity; lost domestic investment, growth, and jobs; and an eroded corporate tax base… Estimates of US jobs lost due to the current corporate income tax range from 200,000 to 3 million, but the consensus is that many companies terminate employees because the current corporate tax structure cuts so extensively into their profits that the companies move abroad. During the 2000s, major multinational corporations reduced U.S. jobs by 2.9 million while increasing overseas employment by 2.4 million.”

01	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""Since its inception, the United States has never had a religious war despite divisive sectarian differences. And in times of crisis, minority religions have supported the government because it has, for the most part, maintained a position of neutrality among its many religions and denominations. This is because the 'wall' or religious freedom law causes all religious groups to be seen and treated equally in the eyes of that law-or, as Jefferson put it, has the effect of 'putting all on equal footing'... Isn't it time, therefore, we stop trying to breach or knock down our philosophical-legal wall of separation, or to claim that it does not exist-either outright, as does Pat Robertson, or by inference, as does James H. Hutson? And isn't it time we say, 'Thank you, John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison' for our wall and the religious peace and tolerance it has brought to our land?"""

The right to vote has been jealously guarded since the founding of the United States.  It has taken constitutional amendments and legislative acts for all groups to be granted the right to vote, and thereby recognized as full citizenships. Legally, African-Americans have achieved the status of citizen. Practically, African-Americans have to continue to fight obstacles set up to deny their citizenship. Historically, in a number of United States' jurisdictions, African-Americans have had to challenge poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, whites-only primaries, and felon disenfranchisement laws, all designed to prohibit them from voting and thus negate their citizenship.  All of the other forms of disenfranchisement have fallen by the wayside, save one — felon disenfranchisement laws."""

01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Uniforms improve discipline, self-esteem and self-respect. They focus attention upon learning and away from such distractions as fashion competition and gang intimidation. Requiring uniforms enhances school security by permitting identification of non-students who try to enter the campus. Weapons have been concealed in jumpsuits, overcoats, and baggy gang clothing. Uniforms help to create unity amid diversity by easing ethnic and cultural tensions and encouraging values of tolerance and civility. Uniforms also bridge differences between students and families of widely disparate income levels. Students from modest economic backgrounds are often the target of exclusion or ridicule on account of their dress. Even from the earliest grades, children feel the pressure to conform to idealized standards of dress, which may be beyond their family’s means. Uniforms eliminate this pressure and allow the attention of students to be directed to learning and growing. Affordable school uniforms can reduce clothing costs substantially. The average clothing cost per child in schools with a student uniform is markedly less than that in schools without uniforms… Chosen by each school, school uniforms provide students with a school identity, strengthen school and individual spirit and pride — not unlike the way an athletic team uniform builds team identity, morale and self-esteem. Instead of feeling alienated or disconnected, students enjoy the sense of belonging that school uniforms bring.”

"""The renewable energy sources for electricity constitute a diverse group, from wind, solar, tidal and wave energy to hydro, geothermal and biomass-based power generation. Apart from hydro power in the few places where it is very plentiful, none of these is suitable, intrinsically or economically, for large-scale power generation where continuous, reliable supply is needed...  Without nuclear power the world would have to rely almost entirely on fossil fuels, especially coal, to meet electricity demands for base-load electricity production...  Increasing fossil fuel prices have greatly improved the economics of nuclear power for electricity now. Several studies show that nuclear energy is the most cost-effective of the available base-load technologies. In addition, as carbon emission reductions are encouraged through various forms of government incentives and trading schemes, the economic benefits of nuclear power will increase further."""

01	Does the ACLU Fail to Protect the First Amendment Rights of Abortion Clinic Protesters?	ACLU’s Reproductive Rights Project has a lot to do with why the ACLU is so reluctant to defend the rights of anti-abortion protesters… Of course there are loonies in the anti-abortion movement, but that was true of the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement of the 60’s, and even today in the ‘pro-choice’ demonstrators. Every movement has it’s fringe element. But while the ACLU was right on top in defending any violations of the law for all of these movements, when it comes to the opponents of abortion having their First Amendment rights violated by the authorities, the ACLU is completely absent… Not even having the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) thrown at anti-abortion protesters moved the ACLU into action… The ACLU would not tolerate the use of RICO against nuclear weapons dissidents, but in the case of anti-abortion protesters the matter is quite different. In fact, the ACLU has actually used the RICO against them. When pro-life demonstrators were sued under RICO in Philadelphia, the local chapter of the ACLU filed an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs, the Northeast Women’s Center… In the eyes of the ACLU the First Amendment protects child molesters, perverts, and fascists, but not Pro-lifers! Quite hypocritical in my opinion.”

Antitrust is no substitute for broader health care reform, but it's an important prerequisite.

01	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Raising the demand for corn as an agrofuel, thus increasing its price in world markets, creates an advantage for the U.S. which is by far the world's largest exporter of corn...  But there is a moral issue here as well. Corn is a basic food staple for hundreds of millions of people. Some 2 billion people in the world currently suffer from hunger and even more suffer from nutritional deficits. Hunger is as much a political issue as one of food availability. For the billions of poor even a slight increase in the price of food can have dire consequences. And with an expected increase in the global population over the next few decades, in poorer nations competition between food and agrofuels can only intensify...  The world's poorest people already spend 50 to 80 percent of their total household income on food. For the many among them who are landless laborers or rural subsistence farmers, large increases in the prices of staple foods mean malnutrition and hunger. Some of them will tumble over the edge of subsistence into outright starvation, and many more will die from a multitude of hunger-related diseases. This is a result of food staples being converted to use as agrofuels.  Ultimately, the choice is between using 450 pounds of corn for food and filling a 25-gallon tank of an SUV with pure ethanol. The 450 pounds of corn (or its equivalent in any number of crops) contains enough calories to feed one person for a year. The crops that would go into two tanks of ethanol per week over a year would therefore feed over 100 people for the year. This bizarre situation is the result of market forces. People with cars (the minority) have more purchasing power than the majority who are living at a subsistence level; therefore, crops for fuel are more valuable for producers than crops for food, as car drivers can pay more for the same crops than the poor. This situation will only worsen as more crops are diverted to fuels and as the global population grows over the next few decades."""

Add those two trillion barrels to the 1.2 trillion barrels of current proven reserves and the 1.5 trillion barrels of oil that can be extracted from non-conventional oil using current technology, and we are looking at more than four and a half trillion barrels of potentially recoverable oil. That number translates into more than 140 years of supply at today's current rate of consumption. To put it another way, the world has only consumed about 18 percent of its conventional and non-conventional producible potential, even leaving aside oil shale potential. That fact alone should discredit the argument that 'peak oil' is imminent, and put our minds at ease concerning future petroleum supplies."""

01	Should Terri Schiavo's Feeding Tube Have Been Removed?	"""For many Catholics--including priests and theologians educated in the years prior to, during, and immediately after the Second Vatican Council (1962-65)--the Terri Schiavo case was always morally clear-cut.   The traditional teaching of the Catholic Church for at least four centuries--a teaching reaffirmed and extended by the most prominent of the pre-Vatican II popes, Pius XII (1939-58)--distinguished between ordinary and extraordinary means of preserving life. No one, the church consistently taught, is obliged to use extraordinary means to sustain their life on this earth...   Almost every reputable Catholic moral theologian who commented on the Schiavo case concluded that continuing the use of a feeding tube to keep Mrs. Schiavo alive was a clear instance of an extraordinary means, and as such could be dispensed with. In the words of The Catechism of the Catholic Church, such means would be 'disproportionate to the expected outcome' (n. 2278).   The autopsy report removed all doubt that the withdrawal of the feeding tube, far from being an act of euthanasia or even outright murder, was entirely consistent with traditional Catholic moral principles.  Terri Schiavo, for her part, was re-born into eternal life."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The two-state option has been eliminated as a practical solution in two senses. First and most graphically, Jewish settlements have carved Palestinian territory into a vestige too small to sustain a viable national society… Even if most settlers claimed they would leave in exchange for financial compensation (as some surveys indicated), this massive grid's economic, political, and demographic weight rendered it a politically immovable object…   The second sense in which the two-state solution has died is that even if a Palestinian 'state' were declared in this dismembered enclave, it can bring only continuing instability. The resulting Palestinian statelet would be blocked off physically from the Israeli economy, its major cities would be cut off from each other, and its government would be unable to control the territory's water resources, develop its agriculture, or manage its trade with neighboring states...  [T]he one-state solution, would resolve the entire conflict in one magisterial gesture and is already an impending reality. It would absorb all the entrenched populations between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River into one unified state...

"""I appealed to the notion that embedded within the confrontational conception of retribution is a commitment to respecting the dignity of every person, a dignity we affirm by punishing offenders for the consequences of their freely chosen and autonomous actions. Such respect for human dignity entails obligations to the offender as well as to ourselves, and among those is the obligation not to punish in a way that erodes human dignity. Capital punishment degrades dignity, on this view, because it unnecessarily extinguishes human life in the presence of viable alternatives. Taken together, these reasons counsel in favor not only of a blanket commutation, but also the abolition of the death penalty itself."""
10	Are Electronic Voting Machines Mechanically Reliable?	"""The 2002 (and 1990) voting systems standards require all voting systems to have a reliability, or Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), of 163 hours, or a 9.2% failure rate in a 15-hour election day. We also learn that this is a woefully inadequate standard especially when compared to everyday items like an incandescent light bulb, which has an MTBF of 1,000 hours, a standard PC, which has an MTBF of 30,000 hours, and even New York City's aged mechanical lever voting machines.  With this in mind we looked at the results from the recently completed 'batch testing' of voting systems manufactured by Diebold, Hart InterCivic, and Sequoia Voting Systems, and put the information from those tests, provided by the California Secretary of State's office, into the MTBF formulae... These results are stunning. Even the best of the DRE systems tested is only 30% as reliable as an incandescent light bulb and this is the only machine to meet the federal Reliability standard. Also stunning is that all of these systems except the Diebold TSx tested in July, 2005 and the Hart eScan [an optical scan voting system] were recommended for certification."""
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Jews, Italians, Greeks, French, Spaniards, Portuguese and many others typically introduce their children to alcoholic beverages at an early age. And they tend to have fewer alcohol-related problems than we do in the U.S. In these groups, people learn how to drink from an early age and do so in the safe and supporting environment of the home. Common sense suggests that it’s better to learn how to drink in the parents house than in the fraternity house. Groups that have a successful relationship with alcohol de-mystefy it and prevent it from being a highly desired ‘forbidden fruit.’ Then, instead of promoting alcohol abuse, peers and social expectations reduce it.”
10	Should E-Verify, the Federal Government's Electronic Employment Verification System, Be Mandatory for All Employers?

Perhaps the most significant problem with requiring the entire nation to obtain permission from the government when starting a job is that the government is going to make a lot of mistakes that affect innocent people. And when a bureaucratic error can prevent a person from making a living, that is an enormous problem and should not be treated lightly."""

10	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Telecom-funded studies have been reporting highly questionable results in comparison with independent studies. Studies independent of industry consistently show there is a significant risk of brain tumors from cellphone use.

Soon, after years of delays, for the first time, partial results from all 13 countries of the Interphone study will be published… The Telecom industry ‘media statement’ (AKA press release) and similar messages will do their best to cast doubt about the risk of brain tumors from wireless phone use.

We encourage journalists to report on the independent science, to make the dangers of cellphone use known to the public, and to thoroughly investigate who was responsible for the Interphone design protocol.”
01	Are Living Wills a Good Idea?	"""A living will is a legal document that informs doctors and medical caregivers what medical care you want if you are unable to communicate due to an accident, severe illness, dementia or coma. It also guides your family to make decisions about sustaining your quality of life that you would agree with. For example, it can specify if you want pain medication, to die at home or in a hospital, and when to cease heroic efforts to keep you alive. Again, check your state regulations and visit the American Bar Association for template forms and additional resources.   Why do I need a living will?   You want your wishes to be recorded in writing, not left to others' discretion. Your loved ones will be under duress and may not remember - or agree with - what you wish to take place. A living will spares your family the heartache of guessing what to do and protects you from receiving more medical care than you want, such as ventilator support or IV feeding for long periods of time…   While it can be challenging to think through these important choices, it can also be a life enriching process for you and your family. And, you can be comforted by the knowledge that you cared enough to protect their peace of mind during a very difficult time of life."""

First and most graphically, Jewish settlements have carved Palestinian territory into a vestige too small to sustain a viable national society… Even if most settlers claimed they would leave in exchange for financial compensation (as some surveys indicated), this massive grid's economic, political, and demographic weight rendered it a politically immovable object…   The second sense in which the two-state solution has died is that even if a Palestinian 'state' were declared in this dismembered enclave, it can bring only continuing instability. The resulting Palestinian statelet would be blocked off physically from the Israeli economy, its major cities would be cut off from each other, and its government would be unable to control the territory's water resources, develop its agriculture, or manage its trade with neighboring states...

They are being trained how to give canned answers to prepackaged questions, rather than learning how to think for themselves. Both teachers and students are increasingly suffering through mind-numbing scripted lessons. Students, especially those in the neediest districts, are being denied the opportunity for a rich and varied education because of the pressure put upon districts to increase test scores in just a few subjects.

And research has showed that most voters don't look at them. Also, research shows DREs with many more undervotes than optical scan... DREs with paper trails work so badly that I don't know anyone who favors them anymore. Some people say they'd rather have a DRE with a paper trail than a paperless DRE, but they also say they'd rather have optical scan than DRE with paper trail...

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	A gold standard self-regulates to match the supply of money to the need for it. Since gold is a finite natural material, and must be mined and processed at a significant cost, it tends to be produced at levels consistent with demand. Under a gold standard, creating more currency requires obtaining more gold, which raises golds market price and stimulates increased mining. More gold is then used to back more money until a point when currency levels are adequate, the price of gold levels out, and mining gets scaled back. [26] It is a self-regulating system. [22] Under a fiat money system the production of money has no natural self-regulation mechanism. Read More

01	Is It Misleading to Label Milk as Free of the Artificial Growth Hormone rBST/rBGH?	"""Both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have ruled that companies that sell milk and other dairy products may state that the milk comes from cows that were not treated with recombinant bovine somatatropin (rBST). This bioengineered hormone is identical to the one naturally produced by cows and, when injected, extends the period of milk production. Monsanto, the corporation that produces rBST, had sued to restrict such labeling. Marketers who use the 'our cows aren't given rBST' approach are thus legally correct but scientifically wrongheaded. There's nothing unhealthful or dangerous (to humans or cows) from using rBST, in spite of activists' claims (does anyone doubt that the proponents of organic foods are behind these claims?). But the implication of this labeling is that the milk from rBST-treated cows is somehow inferior to that from untreated cows, which it isn't. Thus it perpetuates a myth about the supposed advantages of 'natural' products. While ACSH is in favor of truthful advertising and marketing, sometimes following the letter of the law can lead to the dissemination of misinformation. This is such a case."""
10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Every agricultural system produces a surplus of waste and hard-to-use biomass that is best kept in the food chain by feeding it to livestock. Meat or dairy produced this way has little extra environmental impact… Scientists have calculated that globally the ratio between the amounts of useful plant food used to produce meat is about 5 to 1. If you feed animals only food that humans can eat – which is, indeed, largely the case in the Western world – that may be true. But animals also eat food we can’t eat, such as grass. So the real conversion figure is 1.4 to 1… [Y]ou can afford to eat a modest amount of dairy and meat without destructing the environment. But, of course, it is not what we eat individually – it is what we eat as a whole society that has the impact on the environment. Some vegans may continue their vegan ways. I’m arguing for meat in moderation, not to eradicate meat entirely, nor to overconsume it… I was a vegetarian from 18 to 24 years old, and I gave up meat partly because I had misgivings about the cruelty to animals. But I began eating meat again when I moved to the [English] countryside and started keeping goats. I had to do something with the male goats. They wouldn’t produce milk or offspring, so I started eating them. At 59, I now eat meat twice a week. I still to this day have some misgivings about killing animals for food. But intellectually, I know it is the right thing to do.”
01	Should the US Immediately Phase out Fossil Fuels?	"""Civilisation stands at a critical decision point. The global community can continue down the path to self-annihilation by wasting trillions of precious funds in oil drilling, shale, tar sand and frozen methane production, and pursuing hopeless nuclear fission and fusion research. Or it can end the madness of a bygone era and focus its remaining resources on a strategy of survival and prosperity by building an efficient, equitable and sustainable power infrastructure based on renewable energy...   Every thinking person understands that oil, gas, coal and uranium reserves are finite: but not everyone yet understands that production capacity is very likely to be already declining today - while demand continues to soar. This inexorably results in spiralling energy prices, supply shortages in many national economies and social problems for an increasing number of countries and their citizens... The call for 100% renewable energy is essential...  The ecosphere's capacity to mitigate damages has already been breached. The switch to renewable energies has to occur now - long before fossil fuels are depleted. The window of effective action may be as small as ten years, perhaps less. We are in a race against time."""

Prostitution has been a career option for some people since history began. Nothing any law has done has changed or will change that. Sex workers provide a service which is needed and wanted by many...  I cannot accept that in this day and age our nation should continue to make criminals of sex workers because the Bible says it is wrong. In the first place, Christianity is not the state religion of New Zealand, and even within Christianity there are different interpretations of the Bible and related teachings. Secondly, the only prostitutes directly condemned in the Bible were those who used sex as a method of worship, which is not something commonly practised in this country.  The Bible takes a much stronger stand against adultery than against common whoredom, but I doubt that even the more conservative among us would wish to see adulterers cooling their heels in Auckland Central police station...

I believe Obamacare's rocky start — clueless planning, a lousy website, insurance companies raising rates, and the president's telling people they could keep their coverage when, in fact, not all could — is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go. When right-wing critics 'expose' the fact that President Obama endorsed a single-payer system before 2004, they're actually telling the truth.  By 2017, we will be funneling over $100 billion annually to private insurance companies. You can be sure they'll use some of that to try to privatize Medicare.  For many people, the 'affordable' part of the Affordable Care Act risks being a cruel joke. The cheapest plan available to a 60-year-old couple making $65,000 a year in Hartford, Conn., will cost $11,800 in annual premiums. And their deductible will be $12,600.

The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the act would lead to a net reduction in federal deficits of $143 billion over ten years, with $124 billion in net reductions from health reform and $19 billion derived from education provisions...  Is it really likely that a large expansion of public spending will reduce the long-run deficit? The answer, unfortunately, hinges on provisions of the legislation that the CBO is required to take at face value and not second-guess.  A more realistic assessment emerges if one strips out gimmicks and budgetary games and reworks the calculus...  What is the bottom line? Removing the potentially unrealistic annual savings, reflecting the full costs of implementing the programs, acknowledging the unlikelihood of raising all of the promised revenues, and preserving premiums for the programs they are intended to finance produces a radically different bottom line. The act generates additional deficits of $562 billion in the first ten years. And because the nation would be on the hook for two more entitlement programs rapidly expanding as far as the eye can see, the deficit in the second ten years would approach $1.5 trillion."""

10	Should Selling Sexual Acts Be Decriminalized but Buying Criminalized Such as in Sweden?	"""Swedish politicians and feminists are proud of the state's prostitution policy. They insist that it has positive effects. Sexworkers are of a different view. Most of the female Swedish sexworkers I have interviewed voice a strong critique of their legal and social situation. They feel discriminated against, endangered by the very laws that seek to protect them, and they feel under severe emotional stress as a result of the laws...   Criticisms similar to those made by my respondents were voiced in the three official reports made since the law against purchasing of sexual services was introduced... All of the authorities say that there is no evidence that prostitution was lower overall. Instead hidden prostitution had probably increased...   The National Police Board writes that the sexworkers that are still in street prostitution have a tough time. This, they explain, is because customers are fewer, prices are lower and competition harder for the women. This leads to the sex workers selling sex without protection of condoms for a higher rate, and it leads to them having to accept more customers than before (since the prices are lower). The respondents in the National Board of Health and Welfare's study (of which none are sexworkers themselves) believe female sexworkers now experience more difficulties and are more exposed then before. The buyers are 'worse' and more dangerous, and the women who cannot stop or move their business are dependent on these more dangerous men, since they cannot afford to turn them down as before. Even the buyers that were interviewed believe that the law mostly affected the already socially marginalised women. According to the National Police Board, the healthcare system has worries about declining health among sex workers and spreading sexually transmitted disease."""

01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Many people are concerned that cell phone radiation will cause cancer or other serious health hazards. The weight of scientific evidence has not linked cell phones with any health problems. Cell phones emit low levels of radiofrequency energy (RF). Over the past 15 years, scientists have conducted hundreds of studies looking at the biological effects of the radiofrequency energy emitted by cell phones. While some researchers have reported biological changes associated with RF energy, these studies have failed to be replicated. The majority of studies published have failed to show an association between exposure to radiofrequency from a cell phone and health problems. The low levels of RF cell phones emit while in use are in the microwave frequency range. They also emit RF at substantially reduced time intervals when in the stand-by mode. Whereas high levels of RF can produce health effects (by heating tissue), exposure to low level RF that does not produce heating effects causes no known adverse health effects.”

Specifically if nuclear energy is considered 'alternative' (to fossil fuels) then I am in the Pro camp. If nuclear is not considered alternative I am decidedly in the Con camp because I do not believe it is remotely possible to replace fossil fuels with wind, solar, geothermal etc. by themselves. Then there is the question of whether hydroelectricity is 'alternative'. If both hydro and nuclear are not considered alternative then it is doubly impossible to replace fossil fuels with alternatives.   The terms 'renewable', 'sustainable', 'clean', 'green', and 'alternative' tend to be tossed about as if they all mean the same thing when they each have distinct meanings, some of which are less than objective. 'Green', for example, can be a shameless marketing term. 'Clean' is relatively straightforward, meaning there is no pollution involved. Hydroelectric energy is renewable. Nuclear energy is not renewable but it is sustainable.""  [Editor's Note: The term ""alternative energy"" has numerous definitions. On this website ""alternative energy"" refers to any form of energy that is not derived from fossil fuels (oil, coal, or natural gas).

His answer to why she was still teaching amounted to, ‘We know, but we can’t do anything about it.’ So along the way, she taught kids miserably for over 30 years. Her classes consisted of kids with parents who had just moved into this area and did not know better. The school district would move her around to different grades when the parent outcry from those unfortunate enough not to have had prior knowledge about her became troublesome. This is what tenure looks like for parents. Think about how much better those hundreds of students might have learned from a more motivated teacher.”

10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Count me among the discontented. Obamacare has harmed too many of my patients.  It has done so by disrupting the doctor-patient relationship and thereby worsening the quality of patients' care. This is the heart and soul of medicine, as I have learned in in my 33 years as a practicing physician...  Obamacare's assault on the doctor-patient relationship first manifested this time last year, when my patients began receiving cancellation letters indicating that their plans didn't meet the law's minimum requirements...  Nor does it appear that any thought was given to the regulatory burden that Obamacare has imposed on physicians. In their zeal to regulate and standardize health care, the law's authors empowered bureaucrats in Washington to drown doctors like me in a deluge of paperwork and reporting requirements.  This has only forced doctors like me to spend less time treating patients. Compared to when Obamacare was passed, I now spend roughly half my time on data entry and administrative work. I feel more like a data entry clerk than a doctor. Surely this time would be better spent in the treatment room or on the phone with patients conducting follow-ups."""
01	Should Felons Have to Pay All Fines, Fees, and Restitutions Related to Their Conviction before Regaining Their Vote?	"""When people are convicted of a crime, they are punished by society. That usually means spending time behind bars and paying a fine. In Washington state, it also means suspension of voting rights until the felon's debts are paid in full. That's as it should be...   If legislation on felon voting is needed, it is to establish a clear system so that county auditors will know when a felon is eligible to have voting rights restored...   Voting is a right, but when citizens break the law, they forfeit some of their rights. Felons should be made to complete their entire sentences, including probation or parole, and satisfy all related financial obligations before they can resume voting."""

10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	use of psychoactive drugs like marijuana is a health issue, particularly when used for medical purposes. Regrettably, there is a lack of high-quality data that shows marijuana for most medical purposes is both safe and effective. What little evidence exists is of poor quality and may not even be representative of the purposes for which medical marijuana is sought. There are significant gaps in information necessary to treat marijuana like other forms of medicine: Dosage standardization and overall quality control may not be in place… If marijuana is to be treated as medicine, then it needs to meet the same standards of quality, effectiveness, and safety we would expect of any other prescription drug. That standard has not yet been met.”
01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“Year after year, standardized test results have exposed glaring racial biases in our education system. Teachers and schools are no longer able to hide behind school averages in performance, and are now having to answer for the low academic performance of students of color and low-income students… Many teachers embrace standardized test data. They use it to celebrate success and pinpoint areas for improvement. My own children attend schools that use testing to set goals and measure progress rather than consider it a punishment. The school regularly shares test data with me, has a clear plan for helping my daughters in areas they’re struggling in, and gives me tips I can use at home.”

01	Should the US Congress Be Involved in Setting Drug Policies for Professional Sports?	"""This note recommends that the federal government, in an effort to address growing national concerns related to the use of PEDs [performance-enhancing drugs] in society, assume an active role in developing comprehensive drug management strategies governing the use of PEDs in American professional sports...  Congress is uniquely situated to tackle the complex issues presented by PEDs in professional sports. First, by removing drug testing from the bargaining table and putting it under the auspice of federal regulation, the government would greatly reduce the transaction costs involved in collective bargaining. Second, by instituting more thorough and uniform testing, imposing stiffer penalties for failed tests, and better informing athletes of the widespread social side effects of their actions, the federal government could proactively encourage and incentivize the athletes to internalize and mitigate, to a large extent, the negative externalities from their decisions. Third, by identifying and counteracting the cognitive biases and decision-making heuristics exhibited by professional athletes when deciding whether to use PEDs, the federal government could facilitate more socially desirable decisions by the athletes...  Faced with the overwhelming incentives present in modern sports -- whether tangible like money or intangible like the competitor's inner drive -- it is both unrealistic and arguably unfair to ask the athletes to protect themselves from the innate parts of their own character that we cheer so heartily while they are within the competitive arena. Thus, this note proposes that Congress should remove the onus of developing drug-testing provisions from the individual parties and should itself create drug management strategies aimed at reducing PED use in American professional sports to a socially desirable level."""
10	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""[T]he school of thought that advocates legalizing doping, or holds that an athlete has the right to choose whether to endanger his health, is ignoring a completely separate ethical and legal question: should people have the right to use a substance that is not legal for human use under ANY circumstances? The answer cannot be anything other than 'No.' And if that is the case, then we have drawn a line where some substances are OK to take, and others are not. And if that's the case, then what's the difference, philosophically, in where that line is drawn - that more or less substances are deemed banned? The only difference is a world where the semblance of fair play remains, where sports remain the end product of hard work, determination and talent, and a world where sports becomes merely pharmaceutically fueled entertainment. We can choose that world if we like, but with the knowledge that the cost is sports as inspirational and transformative, indicative of the best traits of us as people. Choose that road, and sport is no longer sport, no more noble an endeavor than, say, 'The Apprentice.'"""

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	"Teens are not knowledgeable enough to have access to OTC birth control pills. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated, “adolescents need special attention at every visit for contraceptive services, including comprehensive counseling about sexuality, sexually transmitted disease and emergency contraception."" [51] Some teens may mistakenly believe that they are at a lower risk of pregnancy just because they have access to OTC birth control, even though they may be taking it incorrectly. [52] This lack of knowledge, combined with increased sexual activity due to mistaken confidence in the inability to get pregnant, could lead to more teen pregnancies. Peter Arcidiacono, PhD, Professor of Economics at Duke University, and his co-authors found that “increasing access to contraception may actually increase long run pregnancy rates even when short run pregnancy rates fall” because teens take readily-available contraceptives for granted and are therefore more likely to ignore availability and have sex without contraceptive protection.

10	Should the US Build More Hydropower Dams?	"""Millions have lost land and homes to the canals, roads and other infrastructure associated with dams. Many more have lost access to clean water, fish, grazing land and other resources...  Sixty percent of the world's major rivers have been fragmented by dams and diversions. Large dam and diversion schemes have stopped some of the world's major rivers, such as the Indus, the Nile and the Colorado, from reaching the sea. In the early 1900s, the Colorado River delta supported a rich array of egrets, jaguars and other wildlife. However, the heavily plumbed river now only reaches the delta in rare flood years and wildlife populations have plummeted.The number of indigenous people who once fished and farmed the delta has also declined...  Dams and diversions are the main reason why one-third of the world's freshwater fish species are extinct, endangered or vulnerable. Many shellfish, amphibians, plant and bird species that depend on freshwater habitats are also extinct or at risk...  Viable alternatives to dams do exist, and are frequently more sustainable and cheaper."""
01	Do Athletes Gain an Unfair Advantage by Using Performance Enhancing Drugs?	"""Society cares because steroid use is a form of cheating. Since steroids work so well, they create an unfair advantage for those who take them, and this breaks the social contract athletes have implicitly agreed to: We are going to have a fair contest. There are things we can and cannot do. Even if there were a safe performance-enhancing substance, if it weren't available to everybody, using it would still be cheating."""
10	Would Improving Palliative Care Decrease Patient Requests for Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Death is not fair and it is often cruel. Some die young, others in extreme old age. Some die quickly, others die slowly but peacefully. Some find personal or religious meaning in the process, as well as an opportunity for a final reconciliation with loved ones. Others, especially those with cancer, AIDS, or progressive neurological disorders, die by inches and in great anguish. Good palliative care usually can help in these cases, but not always, and often not enough...   There is no right way to die, and there should be no schism between advocates for better palliative care and advocates for making it possible to hasten death with a physician's help. Good palliative care and the right to make this choice are no more mutually exclusive than good cardiologic care and the availability of heart transplantation. To require dying patients to endure unrelievable suffering, regardless of their wishes is callous and unseemly. Death is hard enough without being bullied. Like the relief of pain, this too is a matter of mercy."""

It may be true that some women in commercial sex exercised some level of informed choice, had other options to entering and have no histories of familial trauma, neglect or sexual abuse. But, these women are the minority and don't represent the overwhelming majority of women, girls, boys and transgender youth, for whom the sex industry isn't about choice but lack of choice.   The argument that legalizing prostitution makes it safer for women just hasn’t been borne out in countries implementing full legalization. In fact, legalization has spurred traffickers to recruit children and marginalized women to meet demand. Amsterdam, long touted as the model, recently started recognizing rates of trafficking into the country have increased and is beginning to address the enormous hub of trafficking and exploitation that it's created."""

10	Does the Death Penalty Cost Less Than Life in Prison without Parole?	"""Fourteen studies have estimated the costs of capital punishment, including one study of the federal death penalty and 13 state- or county-level studies. Each study concludes that the presence of capital punishment results in additional costs. However, there is substantial variation in the cost estimates. Among the five studies that compare the cost of a death sentence with the cost of a capital-eligible case in which no death notice is filed, the average (additional) cost per case is $650,000, but the estimates range from about $100,000 to more than $1.7 million…  Cases receiving a death notice are approximately $517,000 more costly during the trial phase, $147,000 more costly during the penalty phase, and $201,000 more costly during the appellate phase than a capital eligible case where no death notice was filed…. On average, a death notice adds about $1,000,000 in costs over the duration of a case."""

01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“Over the course of my nearly 30–year career in dealing with underage drinking and all the associated problems, I have come to the conclusion that changing the law from 18 to 21 was, overall, not a wise decision. I believe we should consider returning the legal drinking age to 18 (with conditions) and then spend our resources on programs to reduce abuse of alcohol and the effects it has on behavior. While I cannot go into all the detailed reasons why and address all the research in a memo format, I can say in summary that in addition to personal philosophical arguments (they are considered adults in every other way) I believe that the level of drinking between the ages of 18 to 21 has actually increased over the last 20 years. All of the efforts we have tried to implement over the years, including education, awareness programs, heavy enforcement, etc. have had little effect on preventing 18 to 20 year old adults from drinking. What we’ve done is helped create an underground culture that encourages binge drinking without any oversight or supervision. There are studies, statistics and anecdotal information that support my own observations and experience on this issue.”

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Oil provides 95% of the fuel demands of the transportation sector... Every transport mode – cars, trucks, trains, buses, marine vessels, and aircraft – relies almost entirely on petroleum fuels. Only natural gas liquids and, in recent years as the result of regulated fuel mandates, ethanol - have made small inroads in the dominant share held by oil. Further, on the basis of the projections by all major agencies that analyze energy supply and demand trends to 2035 and 2040, this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future...  Proponents of the all-renewable future seem to be stuck in a time warp. For them, it is still 2014, oil prices are still close to $130 per barrel, and natural gas and coal prices are surging. In such a world, it may be easier to make the case that renewables will become far more competitive sooner. The reality, of course, is that the decline of international oil prices to the range of $40 per barrel and the dramatic slumps in natural gas and coal prices in many areas (especially North America), has meant that these hydrocarbons are far better placed to compete with alternative energy sources."""

01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“[B]etween the 1880s and 1973, many thousands of women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to self-induce their abortions or going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. During this time, hospital emergency room staff treated thousands of women who either died or were suffering terrible effects of abortions provided without adequate skill and care. However, since the legalization of abortion, the risk of death resulting from abortion is many times less than a woman’s risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth… The ability to access safe and legal abortion has been critical for many women as they seek to define and live their lives with dignity. Honoring women means honoring their choices, including the choice of whether and when to have children. Women are capable of making intelligent and conscientious decisions about their own lives and families. Women deserve the autonomy and dignity to act in accordance with their personal convictions, and to decide what is best for their own lives and families. Women should be trusted and respected to exercise the choices about their bodies and lives that are best for them, and not be forced by the government into personal reproductive decisions that are against their will.”

The 15-year-old boy who realizes at 20 that his SSA [same-sex attraction] was just a phase of his life related to weaknesses in male confidence will have those pictures follow him for the rest of his life… Given the substantial, well-documented risks involved in engaging in homosexual activity as an adolescent and since a certain percentage of males who experience SSA in adolescence find that these feelings disappear in time, schools should not encourage adolescent males to ‘come out,’ but, instead, offer positive support for addressing the serious emotional problems in these teenagers.”
10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“The claim that preborn children are part of women’s bodies flies in the face of modern science. Preborn children are dependent upon their mothers, but they are not part of them. They have their own blood type, bone structure, and genetic code. In fact, the notion that the preborn is part of the mother would result in inane conclusions—such as the mother having four arms, four legs, and, in the case of a preborn boy, even male genitalia. We also know there are limits to ‘choice.’ The autonomy of any one person does not permit her to infringe on the rights of, or endanger, another. For example, the right of a man to do what he wants with his body does not permit him to rape women. And a woman’s right to do what she wants with her hands ends when she uses them to drown her children. Choice, then, is not absolute. Indeed, some choices are wrong: rape, murder, abuse, etc. Since we would not allow a mother to kill her born children by choice, we must not permit her to kill her preborn children for the same reason.”

10	Has Legalizing Medical Marijuana Led to Increased Drug Abuse among Children and Adolescents?	1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, indicates that medical marijuana reform does not lead to increased non-medical marijuana use. Despite a nationwide debate about the medical use of marijuana that has been making headlines since 1996, the survey found that ‘past month’ marijuana use in 1998 — particularly among young people — dropped from 1997 and was at the same level as in 1995. Despite the fact that since 1996, patients in California have been allowed to grow and use marijuana upon their doctors’ recommendation, there were no statistically significant differences in reported marijuana usage rates among 12- to 17-year-olds in California than in the rest of the nation. These findings should dispel the myth that medical marijuana sends the wrong message and leads to increased non-medical marijuana use. Citizens across the country, including teenagers understand the difference between medicine and drug abuse.

10	Is Medical Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Depression, Bipolar Disorders, Anxiety, and Similar Mood Disorders?	is not clear how often cannabis itself can cause depression, but research suggests that this can happen. It is therefore recommended that if you are depressed, and you use cannabis regularly, you should try giving up and see if that helps. Tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat), dizziness, anxiety, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, difficulty sleeping and confusion are all possible side effects of cannabis. These side effects can also be caused by certain antidepressants, so using cannabis at the same time can make them worse. Both TCAs [Tricyclic antidepressants] and cannabis can cause tachycardia and hypertension. You should not smoke cannabis if you take TCAs because of these risks to your heart. Either stop using cannabis or ask your doctor for an SSRI antidepressant, which appears to be a safer choice.”

01	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“Reagan had the best intuitive sense of priorities of any president in the postwar period, when it became a constant struggle to know what to pay attention to. His designation of the Soviet Union as an ‘evil empire’ froze the blood of international diplomacy, but agitated the moral imagination and did more to advance U.S. national objectives than a year’s Pentagon spending. Speaking of which, Reagan was exactly correct in knowing that the resources of the U.S. could not be matched by those of the enemy. His willingness to install theater weapons in Europe, to explore anti-missile technology, and to commit great sums to defense effectively disarmed the potential aggressor. And then who, more resonantly than he, made the case against Big Government? Could he have known that a Democratic president, seven years after Reagan left office, would serve as an echo chamber on the matter of an end to Big Government? Reagan belongs on Mount Rushmore, and he’ll be there, after the carpers die off.”

The boundary between the therapeutic and ergogenic - ie, performance enhancing - use of drugs is blurred at present and poses difficult questions for the controlling bodies of antidoping practice and for sports doctors. The antidoping rules often lead to complicated and costly administrative and medical follow-up to ascertain whether drugs taken by athletes are legitimate therapeutic agents or illicit...  Furthermore, legalisation of doping, we believe, would encourage more sensible, informed use of drugs in amateur sport, leading to an overall decline in the rate of health problems associated with doping. Finally, by allowing medically supervised doping, the drugs used could be assessed for a clearer view of what is dangerous and what is not."""

In fact, statistics indicate that wealthy capital murderers may be more likely to be executed…  Murderers are put to death, not based on the...economic status of the victim or the murderer, but based upon death penalty statutes, the aggravated nature of and all specific circumstances of the crime, the criminal background of the murderer, and the other specific factors mandated by Supreme Court decisions.

Recently, several dairy processors began labeling and marketing milk as produced on farms not using synthetic hormones, attempting to gain more of the market share of milk sales. These marketing techniques are guiding consumers to purchase this milk, and allowing processors and retailers to charge more per gallon than for unlabeled milk. If consumers have preferences about the way food is produced such as 'grass-fed,' 'organic,' or 'natural,' that's their choice.

Sample votes are cast on the equipment and these totals are verified. (Logic and Accuracy differs from the previous rounds of examination because the testing is specific to the exact ballot that will be displayed in a specific precinct on election day.) Voter card encoders...are also tested at this time, and at least one memory card from each precinct is uploaded to the county server to ensure that the upload features necessary to compile and count the votes are working properly.

01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Based on my own experience as a New York City public school teacher, I am a strong advocate of tenure. While it protects the less than satisfactory by requiring that due process be followed before they can be removed, it also protects exceptionally good teachers from being undermined and removed by administrators anxious to cover their own rear ends and blustering politicians… I organized student clubs that testified at public hearings against budget cuts in education and in favor of condom availability in schools. Club members organized debates on reproductive freedom and informational meetings on the Sandinista in Nicaragua, the meaning of Islam, equal rights for gays, and the importance of the census. Sometimes my actions brought me into conflict with ‘colleagues’ and administrators… What protected me was better than average scores on standardized tests by my students, the fact that I worked in very difficult schools by choice, the school and departmental administrators who respected what I did, and tenure, which made it virtually impossible to remove a teacher without documented evidence of malfeasance or incompetence.”

Of the many scholars who were given Lott’s data and did their own analyses, most agree with his conclusions. States that passed these laws experienced sharp drops in murder, rape, robbery, and assault, even after allowing for the effects of poverty, unemployment, police arrest rates, and the like. States that did not pass these laws did not show comparable declines. And these declines were not trivial – he is writing about as many as 1,000 fewer murders and rapes and 10,000 few robberies. Carrying concealed guns reduces – it does not increase – the rate of serious crime, and that reduction is vastly greater than the generally trivial effect of gun-carrying on accidental shootings.”

As Dr. [K.F.] Gunning put it, the Dutch have proved that once killing is accepted as a solution for one problem, tomorrow it will be seen as the solution for hundreds of problems. Once we accept the killing of terminally ill patients, as did the Dutch, we will invariably, over time, accept the killing of chronically ill patients, depressed patients, and ultimately perhaps, even children...

With Belgian doctors clearly eager to follow the lead of their Dutch neighbor, Belgium formally legalized euthanasia in 2002. Notably, the first Belgian case, the killing of a man with multiple sclerosis, violated the guidelines; and just as occurs routinely in the Netherlands, the doctor involved faced no consequences.

"""The implicit assumption of free choice in wording such as 'the private affairs of individuals', 'personal freedom', 'right to privacy' and 'the consent of two adults' are nothing but the formation of an illusion perpetuating lack of social awareness of sexual slavery.

It is about the violation of women's human rights.  Prostitution is not about women enjoying rights over their own bodies; on the contrary, it is an expression of men's control over women's sexuality. It is the hiring out of one's body for the purposes of sexual intercourse, abuse and manifestations of undifferentiated male lust. It is about gendered, ethnic, age, racial and class power relations. By no means is it the 'consent of two adults', when one party is the buyer and the other the seller, especially when the buying party happens to be socially constructed as 'the better sex', 'the better class', 'the more matured', 'the power-that-be', 'the more cultural polished' or 'the fairer skin' etc."""

If we are to mandate health check ups because of the fear of STDS, ought we not to start with those who are most responsible for them?  (2) mandatory health check ups... led to the formation of the 'abolitionist' movement in the late 1800's - the bureaucrats were extorting the prostitutes for sexual favors and money if they wanted their 'license' and clean bill of health…  (3) the government does not know how we do our work, so mandatory health check ups would not conform to the way we work. For instance, there are prostitutes who... bring their clients to orgasm using only their hands. Why on earth would they need to go have their sex organs inspected on a weekly basis if they don't use them in their work?...

But by 1975, people living in poverty who were placed on Medicaid saw physicians 18% more often than people who were not on Medicaid. [83] A study published in Science found that of 10,000 uninsured Portland, Oregon residents who gained access to Medicaid, 40% made more visits to emergency rooms, [94] even though they, like all US residents, already had guaranteed access to emergency treatment under federal law.

10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	Complaints about high federal corporate income tax rates causing high unemployment are unfounded because loopholes and deductions enable many companies to pay less than the statutory rate. Of the 500 large cap companies (a market capitalization value of more than $10 billion) in the Standard & Poor (S&P) stock index, 115 paid a total corporate tax rate – federal and state combined – of less than 20% from 2006-2011, and 39 of those companies paid a rate of less than 10%. [1] An analysis comparing the tax rates of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies between 2008 and 2015 found that almost 40% paid zero taxes for at least one year over the eight-year period. Of those 258, 18 companies paid less-than-zero over the entire period. [51] A study comparing the effective tax rates of the 100 largest US multinationals to the 100 largest European Union [EU] multinationals, during the period of 2001-2010, found that US multinationals have a lower average effective tax rate despite having a higher statutory rate.

10	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“The exemption of churches from taxation is one of the worst anachronisms. It meant originally that the church was a state within the state, having its own law and deciding itself when and in what measure it might, in times of pressure; contribute to the public treasury. When this arrogant claim was disallowed, church property still evaded taxation on the ground that it served a high public purpose, like, charitable or educational institutions, which were then entirely voluntary, and it ought therefore, to have at least this subsidy of an exemption from taxation. There was no need in those days to inquire very closely into the soundness of the public service. Practically the whole community used the churches and, if a tax were imposed on them, the community would have to pay it. The church was exempt on pretty much the same grounds as the civic hall. It was like transferring your money from one pocket to another. Now considerably less than half the adults of any Community use the churches, and the last argument for exempting them from taxation is quite discredited… Church property in the United States is said to be worth about four billion dollars, and it is increasing rapidly in value… The anachronism is that city property of immense value is used by only about a tenth of the taxpayers of this city, yet the nine-tenths lazily subsidize it by remitting taxation.”

It defends terrorists, illegal aliens and child molesters, while letting law-abiding Americans and victims of reverse racism fend for themselves.”
01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“Obesity is absolutely a disease that requires a range of interventions and medical management… People may say ‘just eat less, have will power’ but they just don’t understand that simply does not work for many people. Successfully treating obesity shouldn’t just be measured in lost pounds, but in not escalating to other diseases. Obesity is a base condition that then leads to or worsens so many others diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, arthritis, and even cancer.”

10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""[D]octor-prescribed suicide is not needed. Under existing law, every patient and/or his designated decision-maker has the right to refuse prolonging life by artificial means. No one has to linger indefinitely when natural causes would lead to death… The most fundamental part of a doctor-patient relationship is trust. If doctor-prescribed suicide were legal, patients wouldn't know if the doctor's ultimate motive was to heal them or end their life. The doctor's duty is to kill the pain - not the patient."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""A Palestinian state of the kind proposed in the two state solution is an existential threat to the state of Israel. Furthermore, it is a historical travesty to expel half a million Jews in order to create a 23rd Arab state. Given that at least four generations of Palestinians have been raised on incitement and hatred of Israel, a weakened Israel with its pre-1967 borders would be an invitation to more war, not a guarantee for peace. Practically, there is no room for two viable states in a territory the size of New Jersey. The logic of having 80% of Israel's population living on the coastal lowlands with a Palestinian state occupying the strategic heights seems unfathomable. The two-state solution has been tried and failed many times. Israel must disabuse itself and the international community of its feasibility."""
01	Does Drinking Milk Inhibit Iron Absorption and Contribute to Anemia?	"""The primary prevention of iron deficiency anemia in infants and toddlers hinges on healthy feeding practices. In infants, the introduction of cow's milk in the first year of life is the greatest dietary risk factor for the development of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Cow's milk is low in iron, and its iron is poorly absorbed. In addition, it decreases the absorption of iron from other dietary sources. Therefore, the strict avoidance of cow's milk in the first 12 months of life is essential in preventing iron deficiency anemia...  In the second year of life, cow's milk continues to cause problems in maintaining iron stores, and its consumption should be limited to less than 24 oz per day, with some clinicians calling for a stricter limit of 16 oz per day."""

Nutrient-rich lean beef can help you meet the new Dietary Guidelines because it provides 10 essential nutrients for about 154 calories. In fact, it can take two to three times more calories to get the same amount of protein from many plant-based alternatives than from lean beef… Research shows beef’s high-quality protein and essential nutrients make good diets better, improving overall nutrient intake and diet quality, and contributing to positive health outcomes like weight management.”
10	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""Scores of activists have protested and scorned the Affordable Care Act... Despite the overwhelmingly critical and hostile reaction, this reform to our healthcare system is not poised to wreak the havoc on American small businesses that the opposition is charging...  The Affordable Care Act does not require businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees to provide their employees with healthcare coverage. To put this into perspective, 96 percent of the businesses in the U.S. have fewer than 50 employees, which illustrates the improbability of the detrimental effects that some claim the Act will have on business. (And if you have fewer than 25 employees and choose to provide insurance anyway, the Act provides a tax credit to offset the cost.)...  Businesses with more than 50 employees will be required under the Affordable Care Act to provide healthcare coverage to their employees. Let's put this into perspective. Only 0.2 percent of the businesses in the U.S. with more than 50 employees do not already provide healthcare insurance to full-time employees.  The Affordable Care Act has provisions to make providing health insurance very affordable for many of these businesses."""
01	Does Judaism Support the Death Penalty?	"""[I]f you look through the Bible, there are scores of instances in which the death penalty is prescribed for a variety of transgressions, both ritual and criminal... In the ritual context, they include violating the Sabbath; they include cursing God. In the criminal context... you are liable for the death penalty if you engage in incest, if you hit one of your parents... And, of course murder...  [M]urder, is actually singled out in rabbinic teaching from all those other scores of transgressions and sins where the death penalty is proscribed...  [B]ecause murder is a grievous offense, both against God and against society. And when you punish a murderer through the death penalty, you are not only affording that person penance for his or her crime, in all of the contexts of death penalty transgressions or other penalties that are imposed upon criminals in traditional Jewish law, the punishment is viewed as a component of the transgressor's penance. But in the context of murder, because it's also a crime against society, it's critical for the welfare of society. This is a traditional Jewish understanding of why it is imposed...  [W]e're not about to take the position of abolition [of the death penalty], because the teaching that, again, the need for implementing justice, particularly with regard to crimes of murder, for society, is a critical component of Jewish teaching as well."""

01	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""However difficult and expensive it may be at the outset to green the U.S. power system, it won't take long before our initial investment begins to pay off in lower electric bills — which are no longer a hostage to global oil prices — and a cleaner environment...   It does cost more to build wind farms and install solar arrays. But once these plants are set up and running, they have lower operation and maintenance costs than conventional power on a yearly basis. No more regular fuel bills and only minimal expenses for upkeep of solar, for example, which has no movable parts that wear out and need to be replaced.   The price argument is also fallacious because we have never paid the real price for the power we use, which includes the cost to the environment and human health of the carbon pollution that fossil-fuel mining and burning generates... We should be supporting technologies that help us to put the brake on destructive climate change, rather than feeding the unsustainable fossil-fuel habit that is driving it."""
10	Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?	“Difficulty in self-regulation, lack of awareness of repercussions of privacy compromise and susceptibility to peer pressure are listed as reasons for teenagers’ cavalier attitude towards online risks such as sexting, cyberbullying and exposure to inappropriate content as they navigate the tricky waters of social media… [T]he risks of Internet and social media to teenagers is just as real as the risks in society. Cyberbullying, in the forms of name-calling and gossiping, spreading rumors, making threats or otherwise sending malicious messages through emails, message boards and social media, has augmented offline bullying and estimates of the incidence of cyber bullying range from 23 to 72% in various studies… Exposure to age-inappropriate content is another serious risk because it causes much damage to an age-group that is already prone to sexual uncertainty and uncommitted and possibly unsafe sexual exploration. Dangerous communities that support self-harm activities, such as anorexia, drug use, and such other disruptive concepts are also serious pitfalls.”
01	Is a College Education Worth It?	“A college degree is always an investment worth making. In the years a student spends working to obtain a degree, he or she develops as a person in ways that cannot be measured by the ‘investment’ of going to college. Whether through group projects with fellow students, an internship with a company, or individual research on behalf of a professor, the college experience educates the whole individual, and helps to develop the person’s values. It is during one’s college years that one develops a sense of self, a world view, an appreciation for the dignity of people, and an enthusiasm for the arts. Also, because of various internship and volunteer opportunities during college, the college graduate has gained a deeper understanding of the importance of civic engagement.”

While binge-watching, the viewer can feel the pleasure of full immersion (aka ""the zone""), which is a great feeling similar to staying up all night to finish a book or project. [12] Many shows are now made for binge-watching. Consider how many full seasons Netflix releases at once, including , Orange Is the New Black, and Stranger Things. [13] Watching multiple episodes at once makes the story easier to follow and more enjoyable than a single episode. [7] Shows made for binge-watching are often more sophisticated, with multiple intricate storylines, complex relationships, and multi-dimensional characters. Media theorist Steven Johnson, MA, says that watching this sort of show may make viewers smarter because greater attention and thinking are needed to process them. [12] [14]"

In vitro (in glass) testing, such as studying cell cultures in a petri dish, can produce more relevant results than animal testing because human cells can be used. [15] Microdosing, the administering of doses too small to cause adverse reactions, can be used in human volunteers, whose blood is then analyzed. Artificial human skin, such as the commercially available products EpiDerm and ThinCert, is made from sheets of human skin cells grown in test tubes or plastic wells and can produce more useful results than testing chemicals on animal skin. [15][50][51] Microfluidic chips (""organs on a chip""), which are lined with human cells and recreate the functions of human organs, are in advanced stages of development. Computer models, such as virtual reconstructions of human molecular structures, can predict the toxicity of substances without invasive experiments on animals. [50] Read More"
10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Since 1998, ACP has been opposed to the practice of DTC advertising, which often leaves our patients confused and misinformed about medications. It undermines the patient-physician relationship and impedes the practice of medicine by challenging the individual physician’s medical judgment… Consider the toenail ad, my personal favorite. While I am trying to tell a senior that it is not life-threatening; that there really aren’t little creatures with horns, legs, and arms under their toenails, living in sofas and chairs; that the drug is quite expensive; and that the risks of toxicity are significant and that it may not work, I lose valuable time that could have been directed at the underlying reason they have those toenails—their diabetes, their vascular disease, their cholesterol, their overall health… ACP would prefer to see Congress ban DTC advertising because it does not constitute appropriate patient education.”
10	Is Euthanasia Acceptable for Severely Ill Infants?	"""Regardless of how one feels about euthanasia of the willing, I would hope most people agree ending someone's life without consent puts us at the top of a deeply disturbing, indeed frightening, slippery slope...   Groningen's guidelines...involve the actual medical homicide of individuals who can't protest or defend themselves. I have no doubt that if the Groningen Protocol becomes official, parents who don't want to contend with raising a disabled child will have their baby or young child euthanized, even if the baby has a fighting chance at a meaningful life. Likewise, family members who fear the burden of coping with a disabled or comatose loved one will seek his or her involuntary euthanasia out of their own self-interest.   Medical ethics has to be one of the most maddeningly complex fields of endeavor on the planet. The mental agility needed to contend with some of these issues is considerable. There is, however, one basic starting point for any ethical inquiry in medicine; one which, though not actually in the Hippocratic Oath, encapsulates its message. It is: 'above all, do no harm.' In other words, life of any quality is sacred in itself, and throughout the morass of ethical issues that arise in the practice of medicine and healing, the alpha and omega of everything should be the preserving of life.   The idea of involuntary euthanasia stands foursquare against that presumption in favor of human life."""

There is a huge difference: No one is required to say 'In God We Trust' in order to spend money or to utter 'God save this honorable court' in order to argue before the justices. But students are expected, or at least requested by the government, to say that this is a nation 'under God.'

01	Is Same-Sex Attraction a Passing Phase Some Young People Go Through?	origins of homosexuality are likely to be a very complex interaction of nature and nurture, genetic vulnerabilities and cultural influences… But whatever its origins, the outcome of homosexuality is best understood as a very complex state of confusion over sexual identity… The National Health and Social Life survey across the USA in 1994, the biggest and best study available, found that eight percent of 16-year-olds thought they were gay – but, significantly, that by age 18 only four percent still thought they were gay, and by age 25, only two percent still thought they were gay. What that means is that most sexual confusion in school children clears away if left to itself. It doesn’t need therapy or counseling. It is a passing phase.”
10	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""Let me put it this way: None of America's founding fathers supported – strongly or not – the notion of separation of church and state. None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Bupkis...  If someone out there in Internet-land would like to challenge that statement, please simply provide some evidence. And please don't tell me about Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut. It is in this letter – and only in this letter – that any founder ever used the phrase 'separation of church and state.'   Yet, throughout Jefferson's long life in politics and government, we see a man who, by today's standards, would be viewed by people like Stark [US Representative Pete Stark (D-CA)] as a card-carrying member of the religious right.   Jefferson not only went to church as president. He did so inside the House of Representatives. That's right. This man who supposedly believed in an eternal wall of separation between church and state regularly attended church services inside Congress. The church services were presided over by every Protestant denomination. And this was really Jefferson's idea of separation of church and state – meaning no establishment of a state sect."""
10	Would Legalizing Physician-Assisted Suicide or Voluntary Euthanasia Create a Slippery Slope to Nonvoluntary or Involuntary Euthanasia?	"""[S]ince there is nothing arbitrary about distinguishing voluntary euthanasia from non-voluntary euthanasia (because the line between them is based on clear principles), there can be no substance to the charge that only by arbitrarily drawing a line between them could non-voluntary euthanasia be avoided once voluntary euthanasia was legalized...  [The Netherlands'] legalization of voluntary euthanasia has not increased the incidence of non-voluntary euthanasia. Indeed, such studies as have been published about what happens in other countries, like Australia, where no legal protection is in place, suggest that the pattern in The Netherlands and elsewhere is quite similar. Some have argued, further, that there may be more danger of the line between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia being blurred if euthanasia is practised in the absence of legal recognition, since there will be no transparency or monitoring...  None of this is to suggest that there is no need to put in place safeguards against potential abuse of legally protected voluntary euthanasia...  [I]f the arguments given above are sound (and the Dutch experience, along with the more limited experience in the State of Oregon and in Belgium, is not only the best evidence we have that they are sound, but the only relevant evidence), that does not seem very likely."""

Coercion is the use or threat of force that's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge.

The pooled results of seventeen studies in 2011 also found milk intake was associated with a small potential reduction in overall cardiovascular risk of 6% for each 200ml of milk consumed a day. This analysis found no association between high intakes of either regular-fat or low-fat dairy products and increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Similarly, systematic reviews in 2015 and 2017 examining milk consumption and cardiovascular disease [CVD] mortality observed no consistent association. This was also the conclusion for milk and CVD risk in a meta-analysis published in 2016; milk intake was found to be neutral with respect to risk of stroke and coronary artery disease."""
10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""Many undocumented immigrants pay taxes, use government services and collect benefits. Most importantly, undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy. Labor economists agree that there are net gains to having a larger labor supply. Some groups benefit more than others do - and some may even be hurt by the millions of undocumented immigrants. In 2012, researchers at the Cato Institute estimated that a mass deportations policy would reduce economic growth by around $250 billion per year. Those costs would not be evenly distributed: Those at the very bottom of the income distribution, particularly those without a high school diploma, may even earn higher wages in the absence of undocumented immigrants.

While, if I had a diagnosis like that, I would personally not make that choice, I support having the option of assisted death in place for others who may find themselves in that situation.   What troubles me about the Bill is it also extends the right to apply for euthanasia to people who are deemed to have 'a grievous or irremediable medical condition'. In my view, this crosses an acceptable boundary for me as a person who otherwise supports assisted dying. The definition is too broad in that it potentially provides the ability for any disabled person who lives with a non-terminal health condition or impairment to apply for euthanasia as well."""

10	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“There are seven European Union (E.U.) countries in which no minimum wage is mandated… If we compare the levels of unemployment in these countries with E.U. countries that impose a minimum wage, the results are clear. A minimum wage leads to higher levels of unemployment. In the 21 countries with a minimum wage, the average country has an unemployment rate of 11.8%. Whereas, the average unemployment rate in the seven countries without mandated minimum wages is about one third lower — at 7.9%… So, minimum wage laws — while advertised under the banner of social justice — do not live up to the claims made by those who tout them. They do not lift low wage earners to a so-called ‘social minimum’. Indeed, minimum wage laws — imposed at the levels employed in Europe — push a considerable number of people into unemployment. And, unless those newly unemployed qualify for government assistance (read: welfare), they will sink below, or further below, the social minimum.”

The Bank of England found that the fiduciary dollar standard badly underperforms in every major category, including economic growth, inflation, recessions, and banking crises. Some still labor under the mistaken impression that the gold standard is a recipe for austerity and caused the Great Depression. This ignores the fact that there was no gold standard in 1929! The classical gold standard was invented by two icons of science: Copernicus and Newton. Their work in astronomy and physics still stands the test of time. So does their monetary work. There is abundant evidence that attaining 4% growth, generating millions of new and better jobs as well as expanding the tax base and bringing in trillions of dollars of new revenue with which to balance the federal budget, can best, perhaps only, be achieved by adopting a 21st century gold standard. Time for a fresh look at gold.”
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“TARGETED killing using drones has become part of the American way of war… The program is not perfect. No military program is. But here is the bottom line: It works. I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict. It disrupted terrorist plots and reduced the original Qaeda organization along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to a shell of its former self… For my part, the United States needs not only to maintain this capacity, but also to be willing to use it. Radical Islamism thrives in many corners of the world — Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Mali, the list goes on — where governments cannot or will not act. In some of these instances, the United States must. And unmanned aerial vehicles carrying precision weapons and guided by powerful intelligence offer a proportional and discriminating response when response is necessary. Civilians have died, but in my firm opinion, the death toll from terrorist attacks would have been much higher if we had not taken action.”

Professional option writers write options only in response to a particular demand.

Additionally, this penny-wise, pound-foolish argument neglects the external costs that result from a perception that insider trading is unchecked.

These processes were not developed by government officials charged with ensuring election integrity, but by anonymous software engineers, hired by vendors and not accountable to the public for the quality of their work. One would expect overwhelming benefits to accompany this sacrifice of transparency and the resulting loss of public control over election processes. That's the myth.

10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“Marriage encourages the sexes to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Even the most successful homosexual relationships, at best, only mimic marriage. Marriage is the union for the purpose of natural reproduction of the human race. Only a man and a woman can accomplish this. Even childless marriages are a social anchor for children. It is wrong to create fatherless or motherless families by design. Same-sex marriages have more to do with the desires of adults than the needs of children. Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households… Marriage laws are not discriminatory. Marriage is open to all adults, subject to age and blood relation parameters. As with any acquired status, the applicant must meet minimal requirements, which in terms of marriage, means finding an opposite-sex spouse. Same-sex couples incorrectly assert that they need marriage to gain certain legal rights, such as the right to visit one another in the hospital, but same-sex couples have had hospital visitation rights by New York State statute since 2004. Anyone, including homosexuals, can use legal instruments such as power of attorney, wills, etc. to share property, designate heirs, dictate hospital visitors and give authority for medical decisions.”
10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Traditionalists will do anything to defend tenure laws giving teachers near-lifetime employment, even amid evidence that all it does is protect laggard and criminally abusive teachers from being sacked from classrooms… As a civil servant, [teachers are] already covered under New York State’s civil service law, which provides rather reasonable protections against unfair dismissals by laggard leaders. In fact, if the New York City Parent’s Union’s Vergara suit (along with that being filed by Campbell Brown’s Partnership for Educational Equality) succeed in eviscerating tenure, Big Apple teachers would still be protected from unfair firings. NEA and AFT [union] leaders cannot argue legitimately why teachers should be granted protections that go far beyond those given to police officers and firefighters (who endanger their lives daily and are subjected to far harsher politicking), much less other civil servants and those of us in the private sector. It is high time that we end tenure and near-lifetime employment for teachers. Our children deserve better than this.”
01	Should the US Congress Be Involved in Setting Drug Policies for Professional Sports?	"""There are some, of course, who believe that this sort of thing is nonsense, that government should not bother umpiring sports, that that's a diversion from the more pressing business of the republic.  Myself, however, I incline my thinking in the other direction, that we need government to intrude occasionally, because sports is too popular, too important culturally to be left to the coaches and commissioners...  A great many countries have a ministry of sports which oversees athletics, and in nations where soccer is uber alles — which is most of them — the country's soccer coach is often a national figure on the par with the prime minister.  While we don't care that much about international sport, our domestic leagues and our big-time college sports are so prominent in our public consciousness that, yes, especially when it comes to matters of cheating, the government has every good reason to investigate, no less than it would peer into possible improprieties in other institutions.  Yes, if professional players are taking illegal drugs and affecting the outcomes of games and influencing the behavior of young athletes, then elected officials are right to step in."""

The very selectiveness of their attention indicates that, on some level, they know that for almost everyone, involvement in the sex industry is a terrible misfortune.

10	Does Ethanol Generate More Energy Than the Amount Needed to Produce It?	"""Manufacture of a liter of 99.5% ethanol uses 46% more fossil energy than it produces and costs $1.05 per liter ($3.97 per gallon). The corn feedstock alone requires more than 33% of the total energy input.  The largest energy inputs in corn-ethanol production are for producing the corn feedstock plus the steam energy and electricity used in the fermentation/distillation process. The total energy input to produce a liter of ethanol is 7,474 kcal. However, a liter of ethanol has an energy value of only 5,130 kcal. Based on a net energy loss of 2,344 kcal of ethanol produced, 46% more fossil energy is expended than is produced as ethanol...  In 2006, nearly 19 billion liters of ethanol were produced on 20% of U.S. corn acreage. These 19 billion liters represents only 1% of total U.S. petroleum use. However, even if we completely ignore corn ethanol's negative energy balance and high economic cost, we still find that it is absolutely not feasible to use ethanol as a replacement for U.S. oil consumption. If all 341 billion kg of corn produced in the U.S. were converted into ethanol at a rate of 2.69 kg per liters of ethanol, then 129 billion liters of ethanol could be produced. This would provide only 7% of total oil consumption in the U.S."""
10	Is Gender Nonconforming Behavior in Children Indicative of Adult Homosexual Orientation?	all cross-gendered children became homosexual. Rather, the data suggest that a childhood cross-gender identity and behavior is the precursor to four types of adult patterns: homosexuality; adult cross-dressing (transvestism); trans-sexualism; and ordinary heterosexuality without any discernible non-normative sex pattern. The strength of the urge for the cross-gendered behavior and the social learning that takes place probably helps to determine the pattern of adult behavior.”

Different strains of cannabis vary radically in their cannabinoid composition and in the contaminants — fungi, bacteria, pesticides, heavy metals and other substances — they contain. And smoking is not a precise way of delivering any substance to the bloodstream. Other plant-derived drugs — morphine, codeine and Taxol, to name a few — have made it through the F.D.A.’s review process, and there is no reason drugs made from cannabis should not be required to meet the same standards.”

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Prostitution should not be a crime. Prostitutes are not committing an inherently harmful act. While the spread of disease and other detriments are possible in the practice of prostitution, criminalization is a sure way of exacerbating rather than addressing such effects. We saw this quite clearly in the time of alcohol prohibition in this country...   I would like the government to decriminalize prostitution but to regulate it in the way that other intimate service professions (such as massage therapists and doctors) are regulated on the basis of hygiene-related concerns.   One thing I would add is that there is a double-standard that permeates the enforcement of laws against prostitution. The prostitutes are harassed, arrested, and sometimes prosecuted, while the johns (and often the pimps, who are far more likely to be engaged in violent and master/slave-like treatment of the prostitutes) are ignored. This reflects the view that men who traffic in women are not as bad as the women in whom they traffic. If people are honestly concerned about the wellbeing of women in this profession, then they must begin by removing the status of 'outlaw' from these women so that they can come forward and receive help if and when they feel they want to leave a profession that can otherwise be quite difficult to escape."""

I didn’t wail and guffaw at terrible jokes or philosophize about the linoleum floor in my kitchen. My response to marijuana simply did not fit the prevalent stereotype of ‘getting high.’ People who have never struggled with a life threatening or disabling illness often do not comprehend how debilitating the resulting depression can be.

01	Does the US Congress Have Authority to Legislate Felon Enfranchisement in Federal Elections?	"""The Congress makes the following findings:   (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, gender or previous condition of servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote in Federal elections. Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the Supreme Court.  (2) Congress finds three areas where discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections: (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in Federal elections which leads to an unfair disparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based solely on where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights after a felony conviction are unequal throughout the country and persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote permanently; and (C) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact ethnic minorities.  (3) Although State law determines the qualifications for voting, Congress must ensure that those laws are in accordance with the Constitution.

10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“Students as young as 6 or 7 years old are now subjected to weeks of preparation for high stakes tests. Because math, reading, and to a lesser extent, science are the only subjects regularly tested, students are drilled in those topics. Meanwhile, subjects such as history, civics, music and art – which help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills–are squeezed out of the school day. When we teach only what will appear on multiple choice tests–and when we ask teachers to read from a prepared script and spend no more and no less time on prescribed subject matter–we cheat our children. Students’ questions and approaches to learning are as unique as each of them. The current standardized multiple choice tests are a crude instrument for assessing student achievement.”
10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“Imagine that Russian President Vladimir Putin had used remote-controlled drones armed with missiles to kill thousands of ‘enemies’ (and plenty of civilians) throughout Asia and Eastern Europe. Imagine, further, that Putin refused to acknowledge any of the killings and simply asserted in general terms that he had the right to kill anyone he secretly determined was a leader of the Chechen rebels or ‘associated forces,’ even if they posed no immediate threat of attack on Russia. How would the State Department treat such a practice in its annual reports on human rights compliance? Conveniently, the State Department’s country reports leave out the United States. Otherwise, it might have to pass judgment on President Obama’s use of drones to kill thousands of our ‘enemies,’ and lots of civilians, many of them far from any battlefield. But as citizens in whose name the president is exercising this power, we need to pass judgment… The more we learn, the more troubling the practice is… The ambiguous definitions of the scope of this war and even of the enemy risk establishing a precedent that drones can be used against anyone a government considers even a long-term threat… The root of the problem is that [drones] make it too easy to kill… In his only major presidential speech on national security, President Obama promised that he would fight terror within the confines of our values and the rule of law.

As a physician, I can tell you first-hand how troubling this mindset can be - every case is unique and must be treated that way...  Supporters of the board like to claim that IPAB is prevented from rationing care, and as far as the language of the law reads, that's true. But dig a little deeper and you find out what's prevented depends on how you define the word 'rationing.' The IPAB is not allowed to say that a person should be denied a particular treatment or type of care, but the IPAB is allowed to cut payments to the physicians that perform these treatments low enough that the effect is no physician is willing to provide the treatment. In my view, the board is rationing care if the effect of their decisions is reduced access to needed care.   Because I am so concerned about the power of this unelected board, I have been an outspoken opponent of the IPAB and have introduced legislation, H.R. 351, to repeal it."""
01	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	"Lowering the corporate tax rate leads to economic growth and job creation because companies have more money to invest.

A tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers GDP by roughly three percent. Higher GDP leads to job growth because companies make more money and have more to invest. [14] The President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board (PERAB), which operated during President Obama's tenure, in a paper titled ""The Report on Tax Reform Options: Simplification, Compliance, and Corporate Taxation,"" called for lowering the corporate tax to ""increase the stock of available capital - new businesses, factories, equipment, or research - improving productivity in the economy,"" and said that it would reduce the incentives of US companies to shift operations and employees abroad.

The best arguments for corporate insider trading are not applicable enough to Congressional insider trading to overcome this presumption.

For years, we have been pretending that the problem was Lance Armstrong, Dwayne Chambers or Marion Jones. Now we are told the problem is not individuals, but a country (Russia). Or an organization, the IAAF.  But even these are not the problem. The problem is human nature. Athletics is humanity pushed to extremes, both physically and mentally. There are enormous prizes for extraordinary physical feats. There are effective means of enhancing performance. At the same time, our anti-doping capabilities are anemic and sporadically enforced...  Yes, athletes will still try and cheat wherever the line is drawn. But by focusing on measurable physiological parameters, and only using zero tolerance on drugs that are unsafe in any dose, we will have a chance to alter the balance so the rules we do have are enforceable, and it is rational not to cheat. We will also be able to tell athletes, teams and national agencies that these rules really matter...

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Even if a prostitute is being tested every week for HIV, she will test negative for at least the first 4-6 weeks and possibly the first 12 weeks after being infected.

The average prostitute services between 10-15 clients per day. This means that while the test is becoming positive and the results are becoming known, that prostitute may expose up to 630 clients to HIV. This is under the best of circumstances with testing every week and a four-week window period. It also assumes that the prostitute will quit working as soon as he or she finds out the test is HIV positive, which is highly unlikely. This is not the best approach for actually reducing harm. Instead, in order to slow the global spread of HIV/AIDS we should focus our efforts on abolishing prostitution."""

Unfortunately, that’s not true. We haven’t ‘proven’ video games directly cause violence because it can’t be proven. There is no way to ethically run experiments that see if some threshold of playing a violent game like Call of Duty may push a person into violence. But that doesn’t mean we are left without evidence. We know that video game violence is certainly correlated with violence – just like smoking is correlated with lung cancer. However, this does not mean that the research does not show causal effects; in fact it does, over and over again. We recently conducted a comprehensive review of 136 articles reporting 381 effects involving over 130,000 participants from around the world. These studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), and aggressive behavior. Violent games also decrease helping behavior and feelings of empathy for others. The effects occurred for males and females of all ages, regardless of what country they lived in. So the question then becomes why people and journalists repeatedly shrug off this compelling body of work.”

Police cannot and do not simultaneously seek to arrest prostitutes and protect them from violence. Currently, under New York Criminal Procedure Law, sex workers who have been victims of sex offenses, including assault and rape, face greater obstacles than other victims. Indeed, women describe being told, 'What did you expect?' by police officers who refused to investigate acts of violence perpetrated against women whom they knew engaged in prostitution. The consequences of such attitudes are tragic: Gary Ridgway said that he killed prostitutes because he knew he would not be held accountable. The tragedy is that he was right – he confessed to the murders of 48 women, committed over nearly twenty years. That is truly criminal."""

The unique bimodal age profile in states with an MLDA of 21 suggests that delaying alcohol availability delays the fatalities associated with drunk-driving. This evidence implies that the nationwide increases in MLDA may have merely shifted some of the fatality risks from teens to young adults.”

01	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""The reality is this: Repealing birthright citizenship would create a self-perpetuating class that would be excluded from social membership for generations. Working with researchers at Pennsylvania State University, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) has found that ending birthright citizenship for U.S. babies with two unauthorized immigrant parents would increase the existing unauthorized population by 4.7 million people by 2050. Crucially, 1 million would be the children of two parents who themselves had been born in the United States. Under a scenario denying U.S. citizenship to babies with one parent who is unauthorized, our analysis finds that the unauthorized population would balloon to 24 million in 2050 from the 11 million today.  This last finding alone should give pause. Touted by its supporters as a solution to reduce illegal immigration, repeal in fact would have the completely opposite effect.  More crucially, the idea that the U.S.-born children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of people born in the United States would themselves inherit their forefathers' lack of legal status would have deep implications for social cohesion and the strength of the democracy itself. This perpetuation of hereditary disadvantage based on the legal status of one's ancestors would be unprecedented in U.S. immigration law...

"A minimum wage increase would hurt businesses and force companies to close. 60% of small-business owners say that raising the minimum wage will ""hurt most small-business owners,"" according to a 2013 Gallup poll. [50] Jamie Richardson, MBA, Vice President of fast food chain White Castle, said that the company would be forced to close almost half its stores and let go thousands of workers if the federal minimum wage were raised to $15.

01	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	Reports believes that, for patients with advanced AIDS and terminal cancer, the apparent benefits some derive from smoking marijuana outweigh any substantiated or even suspected risks. In the same spirit the FDA uses to hasten the approval of cancer drugs, federal laws should be relaxed in favor of states’ rights to allow physicians to administer marijuana to their patients on a caring and compassionate basis.”
10	Is Cannabidiol (CBD) Psychoactive?	high dose of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main Cannabis sativa (cannabis) component, induces… psychotic-like symptoms in healthy volunteers. These effects of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol are significantly reduced by cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis constituent which is devoid of the typical effects of the plant. This observation led us to suspect that CBD could have… antipsychotic actions… The antipsychotic-like properties of CBD have been investigated in animal models using behavioral and neurochemical techniques which suggested that CBD has a pharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotic drugs. The results of two studies on healthy volunteers using perception of binocular depth inversion and ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms supported the proposal of the antipsychotic-like properties of CBD.”
10	Are Children Who Are Raised by Gay Parents More Likely to Be Gay Themselves?	empirical studies published between 1978 and 2000 on nonclinical children raised by lesbian mothers or gay fathers were reviewed (one Belgian/Dutch, one Danish, three British, and 18 North American). Twenty reported on offspring of lesbian mothers, and three on offspring of gay fathers. The studies encompassed a total of 615 offspring (age range 1.5-44 years) of lesbian mothers or gay fathers and 387 controls, who were assessed by psychological tests, questionnaires or interviews. Seven types of outcomes were found to be typical: emotional functioning, sexual preference, stigmatization, gender role behavior, behavioral adjustment, gender identity, and cognitive functioning. Children raised by lesbian mothers or gay fathers did not systematically differ from other children on any of the outcomes. The studies indicate that children raised by lesbian women do not experience adverse outcomes compared with other children. The same holds for children raised by gay men.”
01	Is Large-Scale Wind Power Production Environmentally Friendly?	"""Wind power is an important part of the strategy to combat global warming. Wind power is currently the most economically competitive form of renewable energy. It provides nearly 15,000 megawatts of power in the United States, enough power for more than 3 million households, and could provide up to 20 percent of the country's electricity needs. Every megawatt-hour produced by wind energy avoids an average of 1,220 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. If the United States obtains 20 percent of its electricity from wind power by 2020, it will reduce global warming emissions equivalent to taking 71 million cars off the road or planting 104 million acres of trees. Expanding wind power instead of fossil fuels also avoids the wildlife and human health impacts of oil and gas drilling, coal mining and fossil fuel burning.  While Audubon strongly supports wind power and recognizes it will not be without some impact, production and transmission facilities must be planned, sited and operated in concert with other actions needed to minimize and mitigate their impacts on birds and other wildlife populations... These impacts can be avoided or significantly reduced, however, with proper siting, operation and mitigation."""
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	Increasing the minimum wage would have a ripple effect, raising the incomes of people who make slightly above the minimum wage. Melissa S. Kearney, PhD, and Benjamin Harris, PhD, of the Brookings Institution found that increasing the minimum wage would result in higher wages not only for the 3.7 million people earning minimum wage, but also for up to 35 million workers who make up to 150% of the federal minimum wage. [28] Researchers at the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) found that an increase to $10.10 an hour would raise wages for 28 million Americans–about nine million of those due to the ripple effect.

10	Should Cannabidiol (CBD) Be a Medical Option?	is important to know that the statements in the patent document [United States Patent #6,630,507 Oct 7, 2003] about the purported medical benefits [of cannabidiol] are based on in vitro data (antioxidant properties of this class of molecules, neuroreceptor binding studies, neuronal cell cultures, etc.), and in vivo rat studies. In order to make a determination that these compounds have a role in medical treatments, clinical data would be needed. ‘Does this patent indicate the US government’s position that cannabidiol has medical value?’ ‘no,’ (since that would be done through the NDA [New Drug Application] process and not the patent application process)… DEA is responsible for administration of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). DEA has determined that cannabidiol is a Schedule I substance because it is derived from marijuana… which is also listed in Schedule I. Marijuana is defined under the CSA to mean all parts of the plant, as well as every compound and derivative and preparation, etc. of the plant. Thus far, an [NDA] for cannabidiol has not been submitted to the FDA that shows that cannabidiol can be used therapeutically. Thus, cannabidiol has no accepted medical use in medical treatment in the United States. Having ‘accepted medical use in the United States’ of a drug is a necessary finding for drugs that are not in Schedule I, but listed in a less restrictive, Schedules II through V. Thus, currently Schedule I is the only possible CSA schedule where cannabidiol could be listed. This is not to say that cannabidiol cannot be studied for development or to support rescheduling. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, dronabinol) was developed as an antiemetic and treatment for AIDS wasting and approved for marketing under the trade name Marinol. Marinol is listed in Schedule III. All research on cannabidiol would need to be conducted under a Schedule I license issued by the DEA. An investigator wishing to remove cannabidiol from Schedule I would have to demonstrate that cannabidiol has NO abuse potential in order for it to be decontrolled. This would probably necessitate conducting studies to demonstrate that its pharmacology differs from other substances that have high abuse potential and that cannabidiol is not being abused by individuals… Consideration of rescheduling or decontrol could be initiated by petitioning the DEA and providing all available and relevant data in the petition.” [Editor’s Note: ProCon.org also emailed two additional questions below to HHS on Oct. 6, 2011. As of May 29, 2012, we have not yet received a response. “1. Has HHS allowed other government agencies or private parties to use its patent? 2.

Every president of the U.S. (with only one possible exception) has been administered the oath of office with his hand on the Bible, ending with the words 'so help me God.'...  Since the 1960s, judicial activists have made a concerted effort to banish God from the public square...

10	Is There a Legal Right to Die?	"""Even as the States move to protect and promote patients' dignity at the end of life, they remain opposed to physician assisted suicide.   New York is a case in point. The State enacted its current assisted suicide statutes in 1965. Since then, New York has acted several times to protect patients' common law right to refuse treatment... In so doing, however, the State has neither endorsed a general right to 'hasten death' nor approved physician assisted suicide. Quite the opposite: The State has reaffirmed the line between 'killing' and 'letting die'...   This Court has also recognized, at least implicitly, the distinction between letting a patient die and making that patient die. In Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health (1990), we concluded that '[t]he principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions,' and we assumed the existence of such a right for purposes of that case. But our assumption of a right to refuse treatment was grounded not, as the Court of Appeals supposed, on the proposition that patients have a general and abstract 'right to hasten death,' but on well established, traditional rights to bodily integrity and freedom from unwanted touching. In fact, we observed that 'the majority of States in this country have laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.'"""
10	Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?	"""Most dairy cattle are injected with a cocktail of hormones to artificially increase milk production.

Perhaps not surprising that many studies have found a link between IGF 1 and various cancers... And there's more...  • Prostate cancer: Some evidence suggests that the consumption of milk and other dairy products leads to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Conversely, dairy-free diets may slow the progress of prostate cancer.  • Acne: Multiple studies have linked all types of cow's milk to an increased prevalence of acne in both boys and girls...  • Bone loss: Instead of promoting bone health, animal protein in dairy products can have a calcium-leaching effect.

10	Would Financial Motivations Encourage Insurance Companies and Health Care Providers to Promote Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""Would Physician-Assisted Suicide Save Money?   The answer to the question seems almost certainly no... The primary reason is that the number of people seeking physician-assisted suicide and being granted that asssistance is extremely small...   Most requests for physician assistance come in the last month, or even the last days of life, which would drastically reduce the actual amount of money saved. For example, in the survey of Dutch physicians, 64 percent said they had shortened a patient's life by less than twenty-four hours, and in 16 percent it was shortened less than a week.  ...Even though the various elements that make up the American healthcare system are becoming more circumspect in ensuring that money is not wasted, the cap that marks a zero-sum healthcare system is largely absent in the United States... Considering the way we finance healthcare in the United States, it would be hard to make a case that there is a financial imperative compelling us to adopt physician-assisted suicide in an effort to save money so that others could benefit.""

10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Recreational marijuana is an intoxicating and addictive drug that poses serious medical risks similar to nicotine and alcohol… Cannabis use increases the risk of heart attack, increases the heart rate, alters blood pressure, can induce an irregular heart beat, increases heart stress, decreases oxygen levels in the circulatory system and exacerbates angina… In my court, some juveniles confessed that they burglarize homes or rob their victims in order to pay for recreational marijuana. The cost of recreational marijuana can total thousands of dollars and contributes to unnecessary financial difficulties for families. Recreational marijuana users are more likely to drop out of high school… In short the negatives far outweigh the positives and that is why recreational marijuana should not be legalized.”

If some players use steroids, others are forced to do the same, in order to compete; those who do not may lose their job...Those who use them harm their bodies; those who don't use them face unfair competition...Thus we have an industry which condones, and silently encourages (through higher salaries) the use of something known to be harmful to their employees. In no other industry would we condone this or encourage it...   Baseball should develop an ironclad rule that is tough and only slightly forgiving. If a player is caught using steroids he should be out of baseball for a full year. If the player uses them again, he should be banned for life. No one uses steroids by accident. So, proof of steroid use should lead to automatic suspension from the game or a complete ban from the game."""

With an outrageous boldness that only they could muster, the ACLU has, once again, set their sights on Christmas celebrations. In their never-ending quest to completely eradicate all things religious from public life, the ACLU’s latest lawsuit is an all-out frontal attack on the freedom of speech and the free exercise of religion. Let me ask you- when did a children’s Christmas program become ‘an illegal activity’? When did the nativity story and Christmas songs become unconstitutional? This is the outrageous and dangerous charge the ACLU has leveled against a school district in Tennessee. A children’s Christmas program has been deemed to be an ‘illegal act’ because of the ACLU. Today the American Center for Law and Justice has launched a nationwide campaign entitled ‘Keep HIM in Christmas.’ We want to make sure that Jesus is at the center of this holiday.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, these groups have so far been exempt from the general prohibition against insider trading.  Rather than broadening the ban, however, Congress should repeal it entirely. The ban is problematic on efficiency and equity grounds.  The ban is inefficient to the extent it delays release of relevant information, since this means delayed adjustment of stock prices. Markets cannot allocate resources properly unless they know which companies are doing well or badly.  The ban is inequitable because some corporate executives trade on inside information despite the law. Thus the ban rewards dishonest insiders."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The existence of prostitution anywhere is society's betrayal of women, especially those who are marginalized and vulnerable because of their sex, their ethnicity, their poverty, and their history of abuse and neglect. Prostitution is sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, often torture. Women in prostitution face a statistical probability of weekly rape, like domestic violence taken to the extreme.  The complicity of governments sustains prostitution. When the sex trade expands, women are less likely to compete with men for jobs. When prostitution is incorporated into states' economies, governments are relieved of the necessity of finding employment for women. Blood taxes are collected by the state-as-pimp in legal and decriminalized prostitution. Banks, airlines, Internet providers, hotels, travel agencies, and all media are integral to the exploitation and abuse of women in prostitution tourism, make huge profits, and are solidified as part of the economy."""
10	Is the Death Penalty Immoral?

My vote, when joined with at least four others, is, in most cases, the last step that permits an execution to proceed. I could not take part in that process if I believed what was being done to be immoral...   In my view the choice for the judge who believes the death penalty to be immoral is resignation, rather than simply ignoring duly enacted, constitutional laws and sabotaging death penalty cases. He has, after all, taken an oath to apply the laws and has been given no power to supplant them with rules of his own. Of course if he feels strongly enough he can go beyond mere resignation and lead a political campaign to abolish the death penalty-and if that fails, lead a revolution.

01	Does Islam Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	does not prohibit using, as passive sex partners, the ancient category of men who by nature lacked desire for women, since such men were not considered ‘male’ as a result of their lack of arousal for women. This kind of man is often known as ‘gay’ in modern times, but in the ancient world he was identified as an anatomically whole ‘natural eunuch.’ Although the Qur’an never uses the word eunuch [khasiyy], the hadith and the books of the legal scholars do. Furthermore, the Qur’an recognizes that some men are ‘without the defining skill of males’ (24:31: ‘ghair oolaa il-irbati min ar-rijaali’) and so, as domestic servants, are allowed to see women naked. This is a reference to natural eunuchs, i.e. gay men.”

We don't worry when the Isle of Man TT race or the Vendee Globe claims another life, or when that boxer on the news gets Alzheimer's. And when innocent Canadian soldiers are shot by American pilots buzzing on Army-sanctioned ephedrine, we're still convinced that sport is somehow exempt from the influence of the natural human desire for constant improvement.  The rationalization is that it is okay for pilots to take performance-enhancing drugs, for musicians to use Beta blockers and for our children to swallow Ritalin because performance is paramount. But where are our health concerns now? Perversely, we deny the 'performance is paramount' principle in professional sport while citing health concerns about performance-enhancing drugs. We want better performances from our sports heroes all the time, but demonize the methods used to produce such performances while hiding behind concerns for health that are not commensurate with our normal paternalistic attitudes."""

01	Are Felon Disenfranchisement Laws a Form of Racial Discrimination?	"""Disenfranchisement policies have served various political purposes, most notably racial exclusion. In the post-Reconstruction period, coincident with the advent of poll taxes and literacy requirements, legislators in a number of southern states tailored their disenfranchisement statutes with the specific intent of excluding the newly freed black voters. They accomplished this by tying the loss of voting rights to crimes alleged to be committed primarily by blacks while excluding offenses held to be committed by whites. Such laws were in place for one hundred years before being struck down...   The racial impact of disenfranchisement policies is sometimes justified as an inevitable if unfortunate aspect of a race-neutral criminal justice system: if members of a particular racial or ethnic group are more involved in crime, the consequent disproportionate loss of voting rights is merely a result of their activity. Such an argument, though, ignores the compelling evidence of discriminatory racial dynamics in the criminal justice system-racial profiling by law enforcement agencies, the racially disparate prosecution of the war on drugs, and glaring inequities in adequacy of counsel as a function of both race and class."""

01	Has Obamacare Improved Medicare? - DEBATED	"""The vast majority of seniors on Medicare will see their drug costs go down as the ACA begins to close the 'doughnut hole,' a coverage gap that forces Medicare beneficiaries to pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs up to a certain amount. This gap is expected to be fully closed by 2020, but those who fall into the gap this year will get a 55 percent discount on certain brand-name drugs and a 35 percent discount on generic drugs until they reach the out-of-pocket limit. In 2012, roughly 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries saved an average of $706 each, the Department of Health and Human Services reported in March.

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The existence of prostitution anywhere is society's betrayal of women, especially those who are marginalized and vulnerable because of their sex, their ethnicity, their poverty, and their history of abuse and neglect. Prostitution is sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, often torture. Women in prostitution face a statistical probability of weekly rape, like domestic violence taken to the extreme.  The complicity of governments sustains prostitution. When the sex trade expands, women are less likely to compete with men for jobs. When prostitution is incorporated into states' economies, governments are relieved of the necessity of finding employment for women. Blood taxes are collected by the state-as-pimp in legal and decriminalized prostitution. Banks, airlines, Internet providers, hotels, travel agencies, and all media are integral to the exploitation and abuse of women in prostitution tourism, make huge profits, and are solidified as part of the economy."""

10	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Not only are animals poor models of safety for humans, but they are also unreliable for demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments too. Just as many drugs fail in clinical trials because they turn out to cause side-effects in humans, many others turn out to be ineffective in humans, despite performing well in animals. This makes drug development extraordinarily expensive because companies need to recoup the costs of clinical trials not only for successful drugs, but also for the nine others that fail for each one that succeeds… [F]ar from jeopardizing progress, a shift to advanced techniques based on human biology would accelerate biomedical research, and deliver safer and better medicines at lower costs: a win–win situation that should be supported by everyone.”

10	Zoos - Top 3 Pros and Cons	Zoos are detrimental to animals' physical health. A study of 35 species of carnivores, including brown bears, cheetahs, and lions, found that zoo enclosures were too small for the animals to carry out their normal routines, which led to problems such as pacing and more infant deaths. Polar bears, for example, had an infant mortality rate of 65% due to small enclosures. [29] About 70% of adult male gorillas in North America have heart disease, the leading cause of death among gorillas in captivity, although the condition is almost completely absent in the wild. Other great apes have similar health problems in captivity. [4] Captive elephants live about half as long as wild elephants: 18.9 years v. 41.7 years for Asian elephants and 16.9 years v. 35.8 years for African elephants. Of 77 elephants in 13 zoos, 71 were overweight and spent 83% of their time indoors, contributing to early death. [30]
01	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""[P]asteurized milk actually interferes with calcium metabolism... Before heating [pasteurization], milk is a living food rich in colloidal minerals and enzymes necessary for the absorption and utilization of the sugars, fats, proteins and minerals in milk. Raw cream and butter has 'X Factor' that prevents joint stiffness.   Eight to ten thousand years ago, raw and fermented milk products began to replace animal bones as a major source of minerals in many cultures. These raw dairy products were known to increase strength, fertility and general health. Present-day cultures whose diets are high in cultured raw dairy products tend to be extremely healthy, long-lived people. (The culturing of raw milk breaks down the lactose, and predigests the milk proteins.) Raw milk that is still warm from the animal has traditionally been used through the centuries for various wasting diseases...  Pasteurizing milk kills off all bacteria, including the health-giving lactobacilli. This allows milk to putrefy with bad bacteria over time, rather than sour or ferment from good lactobacilli. Pasteurization also destroys vitamins, especially C, B6 and B12, and denatures fragile milk proteins. It destroys 20% of the iodine, and makes insoluble the major part of the calcium content."""

01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“Numerous studies show important and quantifiable benefits of the different components of vegetarian diets, namely the reduction of risk for many chronic diseases and the increase in longevity. Such evidence is derived from the study of vegetarians as well as other populations. While meat intake has been related to increased risk for a variety of chronic diseases, an abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, nuts, and legumes has been independently related to a lower risk for several chronic degenerative diseases such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and many cancers. Also, frequency of consumption of plant foods has been identified as a factor for increased longevity in industrialized nations. Hence, foods of plant origin seem to be beneficial on their own merit for chronic-disease prevention. This is possibly more certain than the detrimental effects of meats. Vegetarian diets, as any other diet pattern, have potential health risks, namely marginal intake of a few essential nutrients. However, from the public health viewpoint, the health benefits of a plant-based vegetarian diet far outweigh the potential risks.”

10	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for the Symptoms of Hepatitis C?	hepatitis C experts agree that factors such as alcohol intake, coinfection with either hepatitis B or the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and age at infection may lead to the development of significant fibrosis [scarring of the liver]. Other factors remain elusive and not proven. Of particular interest is the effect of Cannabis sativa, or marijuana, on [HCV] disease progression. Many patients use marijuana for pleasure or to combat complaints of nausea associated with antiviral therapy. Marijuana is known to exert its effects via the CB1 and CB2 receptors. An upregulation of CB1 receptors has been found to be present in cirrhosis… By both univariate [a process or mathematical expression with only one variable] and multivariate [a process or mathematical expression with multiple variables] analyses, daily marijuana smoking was found to be associated with the development of significant hepatic fibrosis. Thus, this study reports a strong association between daily marijuana use and fibrosis progression; the underlying mechanism needs to be further determined, although current data would suggest a role in the upregulation of the CB1 receptor. These findings should encourage physicians to advise their patients with hepatitis C infection to avoid marijuana use. Further studies regarding this important and controversial topic need to be addressed.”
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""To end abuses in the sex industry, the Netherlands decided to change the law to reflect everyday reality. It is now legal to employ prostitutes who are over the age of consent, and do the work voluntarily, but stricter measures have been introduced under criminal law to prevent exploitation.   The legalisation of brothels enables the government to exercise more control over the sex industry and counter abuses. The police conduct frequent controls of brothels and are thus in a position to pick up signs of human trafficking. This approach is in the interests of prostitutes themselves, and it facilitates action against sexual violence and abuse and human trafficking...  An important spin-off of the policy is that it prevents human trafficking, which is characterised by exploitation, coercion and violence. The lifting of the ban on brothels makes prostitution a legitimate occupation and gives prostitutes the same rights and protection as other professionals.  The labour laws offer the most effective protection against exploitation, violence and coercion. The policy is based on the conviction that strengthening the position of women is the best way to combat sexual violence. Moreover, abuses are easier to detect when prostitutes operate publicly and legally rather than in a clandestine subculture."""

10	Is Obesity a Disease?	“From the perspective of a profit-maximizing medical and pharmaceutical industry… the ideal disease would be one that never killed those who suffered from it, that could not be treated effectively, and that doctors and their patients would nevertheless insist on treating anyway. Luckily for it, the American health-care industry has discovered (or rather invented) just such a disease. It is called ‘obesity.’ The reasons why the disease of obesity doesn’t kill those who suffer from it and why it remains impossible to cure are one and the same: Because it doesn’t exist. …Most groups of people categorized as ‘overweight’ and ‘obese’ do not suffer from poorer health or higher mortality than ‘ideal weight’ individuals. In many of the largest-scale studies, groups of people currently categorized as overweight have better mortality statistics than anyone else.”

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	"Exempting churches from taxation upholds the separation of church and state embodied by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The US Supreme Court, in a majority opinion written by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: ""The exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less than taxation of churches. It restricts the fiscal relationship between church and state, and tends to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other."" [5] Read More"
10	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""International and national bodies have determined that several methods of execution are likely to violate the prohibition of torture, because of the pain and suffering they are likely to inflict on the convicted person. Studies of the severe pain and suffering caused by other methods has continued to extend this list, to the point where it has become increasingly difficult for a State to impose the death penalty without violating international human rights law.   The long and highly stressful period that most individuals endure while waiting on 'death row' for years, or even decades, and frequently in isolation, for an uncertain outcome, has also been referenced as constituting torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment...   Furthermore, when the authorities fail to give adequate information about the timing of executions, they maintain not only the convicted person but also his children and other family members in permanent anticipation of imminent death. This acute mental distress, which may be compounded by failure to return the body to families for burial, or inform them of the location of burial, is unjustifiable...   There are many reasons why we should move away from the death penalty, starting with its capricious and frequently discriminatory application, and its failure to demonstrate any deterrent effect beyond that of other punishments. The severe mental and physical suffering which are inflicted by capital punishment on the person concerned and family members should now be added to the weight of the argument. The use of the death penalty should be ended."""

In fact, it's just one of the many U.S. policies supposedly meant to support peace that has done just the opposite...  Israelis have agreed to a Palestinian state at least four times since 1947. The Palestinians have rejected it each time. The U.S. and Europe have responded each time by providing more economic aid to the Palestinians and pressuring Israel to make more concessions. That hasn't worked...  Israel should continue to build and expand, and annex all the existing West Bank territories into Israel proper. Israeli citizenship, with all the rights and privileges it entails, should be offered to all its inhabitants. This is not a crazy idea, but a simple recipe that worked in Israel proper for generations and has produced too many Jewish and Arab success stories to count...  Arabs, Jews, and Christians are living relatively peacefully and much more prosperously in Israel proper and have been for years. It's time for everyone living in the West Bank territories to enjoy the same rights and opportunities and not the time for anyone to insist on more racially and religiously segregated states."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“[W]e are finding satellite evidence that the climate system is much less sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) climate models suggest that it is. And if that is true, then mankind’s CO2 emissions are not strong enough to have caused the global warming we’ve seen over the last 100 years… [M]ost of the warming could be the result of a natural cycle in cloud cover forced by a well-known mode of natural climate variability: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). While the PDO is primarily a geographic rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the North Pacific, it is well known that such regional changes can also influence weather patterns over much larger areas… [R]ecent satellite measurements – even though they span only 7.5 years – support the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as a potential major player in global warming and climate change.”
01	Should the Death Penalty Be Allowed?	"""The death penalty serves three functions. First, for some crimes any lesser punishment is inadequate as a matter of basic justice... Second, an executed death sentence absolutely guarantees the killer will never kill again. A life sentence does not.

Third, I believe that an effective, enforced death penalty deters some murders."""
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Making it easier to fire bad teachers isn’t going to magically cause the educational achievement gap to disappear. You need to be able to attract and retain more good teachers, too… Improving the quality of teachers who work with poor kids seems more about insufficient inflow of the talented than insufficient outflow of the untalented. One study, based on a policy change in Chicago, found that even when dismissal rules are relaxed, many principals still choose not to fire anyone — including at the worst-performing schools — perhaps at least partly because of the challenge of finding decent replacements… Weakening job security in the absence of other reforms may even discourage good people from entering or sticking with the profession. That’s because job security is one of the key forms of compensation that we still offer to educators as their salaries have gotten less competitive over time…. Reducing job security may sound like a cheap way to improve teacher quality. But without some of the costlier changes necessary to make the most difficult teaching jobs more appealing to the most desirable workers, it seems unlikely to be the silver bullet school reformers are hoping for.”

01	Would Allowing Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Decrease Fan Turnout, Revenue, and Corporate Sponsorship?	"""To the extent that the public perceives that a PED [performance enhancing drug] reduces the role of skill and replaces it by chemically induced brute strength and endurance, it is likely to lose interest in the sports in which it is used. The harm would be primarily financial, but this in turn could lead to the demise of professional leagues and contests.  This argument pertains mainly to elite sport whose thriving depends on a large fan base, rather than to amateur and recreational sport. Sporting events would increasingly become tests of rivals' access to good pharmaceutical technology and knowledge and their bodies' ability to use these chemicals efficiently.  Even though skill, strategy, and effort would still play a central role in athletic success, pharmaceutical technology and athletes' bodily responses to it would also play a significant role. It is not that people are not interested in science fairs; it is just that people expect sport to be a different kind of test, one in which athletes' own qualities are the major determinants of success."""
01	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Grains are the staple food of most people in the developing world, although which particular cereal depends on the region. We can combine IFPRI's [International Food Policy Research Institute] estimate that biofuels account for 30% of the rise in grain prices and the World Bank president's figure of 100 million more hungry people due to higher food prices. This combination suggests that biofuels are responsible for 30 million more people going hungry in the world. The IFPRI model also allows us to estimate the number of malnourished children less than age five under various conditions. Based on the model there are some 2.4 million more malnourished pre-schoolers in the developing countries in 2008 due to the impact of biofuels. Current research, that I and colleagues are working on, suggests that 390,000 additional children under the age of five will die because of this increase in malnutrition due to biofuels. If current biofuel development trends continue, child deaths will rise to 475,000, almost one-half million by 2010."""

The childhood finding seems to be associated with homosexuality per se, distributed both across all types of psychopathology and among men without significant psychopathology. At present, I believe this is the only correlation between psychopathology and homosexuality that may be taken as an established fact… The combined results of numerous investigations lead to the conclusion that childhood gender identity/gender role disturbances are associated with predominant or exclusive homosexuality in adulthood. Absence of such disturbance diminishes the likelihood that a boy will become a man who is exclusively or predominantly homosexual.”

10	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	Women who take birth control pills without medical supervision can put themselves at risk. Jennifer Ashton, MD, gynecologist, stated, “It’s generally accepted knowledge that the overall health literacy of the lay population is about at the 7th-grade level,” adding that even with one-on-one counseling and explanations about how the Pill works, patients are still confused. [54] Birth control pills do have serious and sometimes fatal contraindications, meaning not every woman should take them. When a drug is OTC, 49% of people get information about the drug from mass media, and only 27% contact their doctors with questions about OTC drugs. [55] [56] This lack of communication and lack of awareness of contraindications can put women at risk. Contraindications for birth control pills include women over 35 years old, women who smoke, who have a history of diabetes, heart disease, blood clots, cancer, stroke, liver disease, high blood pressure, migraines (and migraines with aura), or bladder disease. [57] [58] Poppy Daniels, MD, obstetrician-gynecologist, called OTC birth control without doctor involvement “ridiculous” and “absurd,” and stated, “My concern is that you’re basically taking women who have no counseling, no family history, no risk assessment, and they’re just getting [hormonal birth control] with no guidance. Why would you take that risk?” [59] If the Pill is prescribed, the doctor or pharmacist can tell the patient about any possible interactions and prevent bad drug combinations. Drugs that can interfere with birth control pills include the antibiotic rifampin, many anti-HIV drugs, some anti-fungal medications, some anti-seizure drugs, the stimulant modafinil, many drugs to treat epilepsy, some medications for bipolar disorder, and many herbal remedies including flaxseed and St. John’s wort.

Like other forces operating in the Tribal Areas, the USA appears to be exploiting the lawless and remote nature of the region to evade accountability for its violations… US policy and practice on targeted killings and drones are not only of concern in their own right: they also set a dangerous precedent that other states may seek to exploit to avoid responsibility for their own unlawful killings. If unchecked there is a real risk that the continued use of drones by the USA and an increasing number of other states will further corrode the foundations of the international framework for the protection of human rights.”

10	Should the US Increase Its Use of Natural Gas?	"""Having a fleet of natural gas–powered vehicles (NGVs) would simply replace U.S. dependence on foreign oil with a dependence on natural gas, another fossil fuel. The United States has scarcely 3 percent of the world's proved natural gas reserves, yet even without the increased demand that would result from an NGV fleet, the country already consumes nearly a quarter of the world's natural gas. At current rates of consumption, U.S. proved reserves would only meet national demand for another nine years...  Just like oil, natural gas is a finite, nonrenewable resource. This means that switching to a fleet of NGVs would be at best a short-term fix. As natural gas becomes more difficult to obtain and more costly, a fleet of NGVs and the 20,000 or so natural gas refueling stations that would be required to support them would simply be abandoned...  Choosing natural gas to power our vehicles would send the United States down the same expensive and inefficient path that created our addiction to foreign oil and our dependence on a resource that will ultimately run out."""
01	Should the United States Authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline to Import Tar Sand Oil from Canada?	"""I am encouraged that the Keystone XL pipeline project will come to a vote on the Senate floor as one of the first pieces of legislation for the 114th Congress.

Every state – including West Virginia – would benefit economically from this activity. It is my sincere hope that we can once and for all move forward with this important project."""
01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“The case for allowing gays to marry begins with equality, pure and simple. Why should one set of loving, consenting adults be denied a right that other such adults have and which, if exercised, will do no damage to anyone else? Not just because they have always lacked that right in the past, for sure: until the late 1960s, in some American states it was illegal for black adults to marry white ones, but precious few would defend that ban now on grounds that it was ‘traditional’. Another argument is rooted in semantics: marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and so cannot be extended to same-sex couples. They may live together and love one another, but cannot, on this argument, be ‘married’. But that is to dodge the real question—why not?—and to obscure the real nature of marriage, which is a binding commitment, at once legal, social and personal, between two people to take on special obligations to one another. If homosexuals want to make such marital commitments to one another, and to society, then why should they be prevented from doing so while other adults, equivalent in all other ways, are allowed to do so?”

01	Does Obamacare Allow Health Insurance Plans to Cover Alternative Medicine? - YES	"""Licensed Naturopathic physicians provide services that are important to millions of Americans, and nothing in the Affordable Care Act prevents insurance companies from including licensed Naturopathic physicians in their network of providers, or from covering services that licensed Naturopathic physicians provide.   The Affordable Care Act requires non-grandfathered health plans in the individual and small group markets to cover the essential health benefits package, which includes 10 general categories of items and services described in the statute that are equal in scope to a typical employer health plan. The benefits must be substantially equal to the essential health benefits covered by the state benchmark plan...  Plans may also offer additional benefits. Therefore, even if the state benchmark plan does not cover services provided by a licensed Naturopathic physician, qualified health plans may choose to cover those services."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Although wind, solar, biofuels and nuclear all compete with fossil fuels as sources of primary energy, their contribution to the world's total energy demand is limited because they are more expensive than fossil fuels – and in the case of nuclear, limited by waste and disposal concerns...

01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“X-rays and UV rays carry enough energy that they can physically rearrange DNA structure (and that ain’t good!). Visible light is not dangerous because it does not have enough energy to damage DNA… What about cell phones? They typically broadcast between 800 Mhz and 2.1 GHz, which corresponds to an energy that is one million times less than visible light… The only effect of such low-energy radiation is a tiny amount of heating of the ear and brain matter – about one one-thousandth as much as the brain heating caused by wearing a hat… The nature of light and of our bodies suggest that cell phone radiation cannot cause cancer, no matter how much is present. Similarly, radio waves, TV transmissions, microwaves and the radiation from power lines are all too feeble to cause DNA damage, and, hence, cancer. Tell your friends — feel free to call them!”

10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""[C]ampaigning to end certain people’s lives doesn’t end suffering – it passes on the suffering to other similar people, who now have to fear they are the next people in line to be seen as having worthless lives. And people who have died from a drug overdose have no freedom of choice at all. Moreover, societies that authorize suicide as a 'choice' for some people soon end up placing pressure on them to 'do the right thing' and kill themselves... Seeing suicide as a solution for some illnesses can only undermine the willingness of doctors and society to learn how to show real compassion and address patients’ pain and other problems. In states that have legalized assisted suicide, in fact, most patients request the lethal drugs not due to pain (or even fear of future pain), but due to concerns like 'loss of dignity' and 'becoming a burden on others' – attitudes that these laws encourage. The solution is to care for people in ways that assure them that they have dignity and it is a privilege, not a burden, to care for them as long as they live."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""In my police career, I met and even developed working relationships with 'working girls.' The work is nothing like Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman.'

Legalization won't stop that. More than likely, male abusers still will profit from trafficking their victims — this time, in legalized locations facilitated and regulated by the government itself.  Legalization would put lipstick on modern-day slavery and call it another step in the liberation of women.  I would say the idea that prostitution should be legalized is wrong. For those few who suggest otherwise, I would argue sex for money is illegal not just because it's immoral, but because it's just plain bad for women at every level."""

I believe that’s what a fetus is: a human life. And that doesn’t make me one iota less solidly pro-choice… Here’s the complicated reality in which we live: All life is not equal. That’s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-precious-baby storm troopers. Yet a fetus can be a human life without having the same rights as the woman in whose body it resides. She’s the boss.

"""If 13 million people living within our borders can't drive, fly, travel on a train or bus, or otherwise participate in society without a driver's license and they cannot get a legitimate one, then the market will supply them an illegal fraudulent one...  On the other hand, if illegal aliens are allowed to get legitimate licenses upon thorough vetting of their identity, then the only ones who will be trying to get fraudulent documents will be terrorists or criminals...   Fourteen states currently allow driver's licenses to be obtained without showing 'legal presence.' These laws were enacted for public safety reasons -- to ensure that drivers meet some standard to drive and to lower insurance premiums by decreasing the pool of unlicensed and uninsured drivers...

01	Birthright Citizenship Debate: Should Children Born on US Soil to Undocumented Immigrants Automatically Have US Citizenship?	"""Under the umbrella of family rights with regard to immigration policy, repealing birthright citizenship would severely harm families by creating splits within newly immigrated families, placing unfair burdens on new immigrants, and disabling the American dream. As a hallmark of immigration law, family unity in the U.S. would be at risk of dissolution without birthright citizenship, and immigrant families who are already at an economic disadvantage in the U.S. would face a greater struggle to support themselves and succeed in American society. Most importantly, without birthright citizenship, citizenship in the U.S. would become the basis for a caste system – at the top, a class of Americans, and at the bottom, a class of descendants of modern immigrants, politically, legally, and socially disabled without the privilege of citizenship in the place they call home."""
10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“Marijuana causes pyschosis. Psychosis causes violence. The obvious implication is that marijuana causes violence… [L]egalization signals that marijuana is not dangerous and encourages teen use.

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“If the minimum wage in 1968 had simply kept up with inflation it would be more than $10 today. If it also kept up with the added productivity of American workers since then, it would be more than $21 an hour… More money in people’s pockets means more demand for goods and services, which means more jobs not fewer jobs. Studies also show that when the minimum is raised more people are brought into the pool of potential employees, giving employers more choice of whom to hire. This reduces turnover and helps employers save money. Finally, employers who don’t pay enough to lift their employees out of poverty are indirectly subsidized by the rest of us – who are paying billions each year in food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, and welfare, to make up the difference. The minimum wage should be raised to $15 an hour. It’s the least that a decent society should require.”
01	Did the Founding Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State?	"""It was Jefferson who gave us the phrase, 'a wall of separation between church and state.' It's downright silly to act as if those specific words, 'separation of church and state,' have to be in the Constitution for the concept to be there.  Madison in pleading for Virginia's ratification of the new Constitution said, 'There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.' This view was consistent with his earlier comment on the Statute for Religious Liberty when he wrote Jefferson that the bill had 'extinguished forever the ambitious hope of making laws for the human mind.' Madison's logic requires a separation of church and state well beyond a flimsy injunction against the establishment of a national church...  The Founders were divided but the majority favored separation of church and state.

Both secular liberals who sneer at the idea that evangelicals could ever be a positive influence in politics and Christian conservatives who want to knock down the 'wall' should take note: It was the 18th-century evangelicals who provided the political shock troops for Jefferson and Madison in their efforts to keep government from strong involvement with religion."""
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""The only solution can be a political one achieved by peace negotiations and compromise, mutual recognition and acceptance.

Minor border alterations on the basis of land exchange by agreement can allow some Jewish settlements stay under the PA [Palestinian Authority]. At the same time the Palestinians should stop terrorist activities and convince the Israelis that they accept Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.

But as a marriage advocate, the time has come for me to accept gay marriage and emphasize the good that it can do… I don’t believe that opposite-sex and same-sex relationships are the same, but I do believe, with growing numbers of Americans, that the time for denigrating or stigmatizing same-sex relationships is over. Whatever one’s definition of marriage, legally recognizing gay and lesbian couples and their children is a victory for basic fairness. Another good thing is comity. Surely we must live together with some degree of mutual acceptance, even if doing so involves compromise. …I have no stomach for what we often too glibly call ‘culture wars.’ Especially on this issue, I’m more interested in conciliation than in further fighting. A third good thing is respect for an emerging consensus. The population as a whole remains deeply divided, but most of our national elites, as well as most younger Americans, favor gay marriage. This emerging consensus may be wrong on the merits. But surely it matters.” [Editor’s Note: Prior to David Blankenhorn’s June 22, 2012 Pro statement above, he made a Con statement on Sep. 19, 2008.]
01	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Beneficial bacteria provide benefits in a number of ways…[o]ne of the ways that they provide benefit is by producing specific substances which kill other [harmful] bacteria.

Additionally, they have been shown -- beneficial bacteria have been shown to block the entrance of [harmful] bacteria into the body, therefore preventing the illness…   Prebiotic is a substance which when introduced to beneficial bacteria stimulates their growth or stimulates their beneficial activity. A probiotic is defined technically as bacteria, beneficial bacteria, which when added to a product or as a supplement provides those beneficial bacteria to the person that's drinking the milk. My personal take on this is it's obvious from the definitions that fresh market - raw market milk is in fact a prebiotic. It does stimulate beneficial organisms. And although not technically meeting the definition of a probiotic because it's not added, these beneficial bacteria that are present are natively present in [raw] milk."""
01	Should birth control pills be available over the counter?	“If birth control pills are made available over the counter prices are likely to drop. That’s because oral contraceptives will be liberated from the third-party spending trap. As is the case with doctor, hospital, and lab bills, the presence of a third-party payer results in higher prices for prescription drugs than would otherwise be the case if a pharmacy was dealing directly with the patient, not the third-party middleman… Reclassifying birth control pills to over the counter can save women money in the long run. It also adds convenience, choice, and privacy. Medical science supports the move. The only remaining obstacles are political.”

10	Is Biofuel Production a Major Cause of the World Food Crisis?	"""Accelerated growth in corn use for ethanol has led critics to question corn growers' ability to satisfy demand for both renewable fuels and traditional markets such as livestock and poultry feed, food processing and exports...  Those who say we must prioritize the demands on grain in a 'food vs. fuel' scenario are not taking into account the dramatic advances in seed technology, improved agricultural efficiency, innovations in biofuels production and other breakthroughs that are allowing the American farmer to meet the world's need for food, feed, fuel and other uses...  Even as corn use for ethanol has risen dramatically over the past 10 years, American farmers have continued to be the world's top exporter of corn—satisfying the demands of foreign customers. Corn exports have stayed steady or expanded slightly...  Most of the corn exported from the United States is used for livestock feed, not human food. In 2006/07, the U.S. sent 33 percent of its corn exports to Japan (primarily for livestock production), while about one-hundredth of one percent (.01%) went to the top ten undernourished countries in the world."""
01	Does Judaism Support the Death Penalty?	"""[T]he preservation of human dignity requires capital punishment of convicted murderers. The position of Judaism is opposite of the position espoused by liberals. It is precisely because of man's creation in God's image that capital punishment is declared justified and necessary. Human dignity requires execution of murderers, not compassion for their souls.  Moreover, capital punishment is regarded in Judaism as a favor for the capital sinner, a form of atonement and redemption. Ordinary murderers are allowed to achieve atonement for their souls in their execution. Only especially vile murderers - such as false witness whose lies are discovered after the person who was framed has been executed, or a man who sacrifices both his son and his daughter to the pagan god Molokh - are denied execution because they are regarded as beyond redemption through capital punishment. Again, execution preserves human dignity, it does not defile it."""
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“July [2014] will mark five years since the federal minimum wage was last raised. We urge you to act now and enact a three-step raise of 95 cents a year for three years—which would mean a minimum wage of $10.10 by 2016—and then index it to protect against inflation… This policy would directly provide higher wages for close to 17 million workers by 2016. Furthermore, another 11 million workers whose wages are just above the new minimum would likely see a wage increase through ‘spillover’ effects, as employers adjust their internal wage ladders. The vast majority of employees who would benefit are adults in working families… In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and providing some help on the jobs front.”

"""[C]ampaigning to end certain people’s lives doesn’t end suffering – it passes on the suffering to other similar people, who now have to fear they are the next people in line to be seen as having worthless lives. And people who have died from a drug overdose have no freedom of choice at all. Moreover, societies that authorize suicide as a 'choice' for some people soon end up placing pressure on them to 'do the right thing' and kill themselves... Seeing suicide as a solution for some illnesses can only undermine the willingness of doctors and society to learn how to show real compassion and address patients’ pain and other problems. In states that have legalized assisted suicide, in fact, most patients request the lethal drugs not due to pain (or even fear of future pain), but due to concerns like 'loss of dignity' and 'becoming a burden on others' – attitudes that these laws encourage. The solution is to care for people in ways that assure them that they have dignity and it is a privilege, not a burden, to care for them as long as they live."""

The opposite has been found. From the data gathered by Kinsey, penile lengths were statistically 0.8 cm longer for males with SSA than males with OSA [opposite sex attraction]… Similarly, male puberty should be delayed if there were fetal genital attack, but the very large Add Health longitudinal adolescent study showed no difference in age of puberty between those with SSA and those with OSA… An antiboy antibody? Unlikely.”
01	Did Electronic Voting Machines in the 2000 and 2004 Elections Give an Advantage to a Particular Political Party or a Candidate from a Particular Party?	"""What is most anomalous about the irregularities in 2004 was their decidedly partisan bent: Almost without exception they hurt John Kerry and benefited George Bush. After carefully examining the evidence, I've become convinced that the president's party mounted a massive, coordinated campaign to subvert the will of the people in 2004. Across the country, Republican election officials and party stalwarts employed a wide range of illegal and unethical tactics to fix the election...   [E]vidence suggests that Republicans tampered with the software used to tabulate votes. Two weeks before the election, an employee of ES&S, the company that manufactures the machines, was observed by a local election official making an unauthorized log-in to the central computer used to compile election results... For the second election in a row, the president of the United States was selected not by the uncontested will of the people but under a cloud of dirty tricks... If the last two elections have taught us anything, it is this: The single greatest threat to our democracy is the insecurity of our voting system."""
10	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	a treatment provider, I support the Food and Drug Administration’s dismissal of medical benefit from marijuana. Regardless of the heated political debate that swirls around this issue, the fact remains that despite the Institute of Medicine’s claim to the contrary, for people vulnerable to addictive disease, marijuana is a gateway drug that leads to the use of more dangerous drugs like cocaine and heroin… Not everyone who smokes marijuana will necessarily become an addict. But why open the gate to increased use for the sake of unproven medical benefits when we already know the harm that marijuana inflicts on millions of Americans?”

01	Would Increasing Legal Immigration Reduce Illegal Immigration?	"""The problem is that our immigration quotas provide so few opportunities for most of them to enter the country legally. ...there are only 5,000 visas available for unskilled foreigners seeking year-round work. A Mexican without family in the U.S. who wants to do something other than farm work has virtually no legal way to enter the country. And even a man with family here must wait from 6 to 22 years for a visa, depending on what kind of relatives he has and what their legal status is.  This is the heart of the current crisis. We need the labor; foreign workers want the jobs. But there are no legal channels – so inevitably people come illegally. And it is this mismatch – the mismatch between the size of the flow and our quotas – that creates most of the problems we associate with immigration."""

Position 5: ACP strongly supports exemption from federal criminal prosecution; civil liability; or professional sanctioning, such as loss of licensure or credentialing, for physicians who prescribe or dispense medical marijuana in accordance with state law. Similarly, ACP strongly urges protection from criminal or civil penalties for patients who use medical marijuana as permitted under state laws.”
10	Should Congress pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act?	"""Congress should not pass the STOCK Act, even if it just passed the House 417-2.  Market prices tend to reflect material information rapidly. If they don’t, people with material information will buy or sell until they do. Stopping this tendency is like trying to gather smoke with your bare hands. Whatever class of people this measure applies to will still hold information, and that information will find its way out. It may be slower, but the incentives will carry the day, and enrich people closely connected to those with information. Instead, robust disclosure requirements for government generally, not just Congress and its immediate employees, are a better way to go. And putting greater discretionary authority in the Department of Justice on this score undermines our liberty in the long run, by further tipping the scales toward the executive branch.  Sunshine is the best disinfectant, the saying goes. Our government is putting on a show in light of dismal approval ratings. We need to address more important matters, including the reasons why information in Congress, the Executive Branch, and the intelligence and regulatory agencies is so valuable in the first place. Our government has too much power in our marketplaces."""
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Health care is not a fundamental ‘right’ in our society. The unalienable rights cited in the Declaration of Independence are life, liberty and the ‘pursuit’ (not the delivery) of happiness. The Preamble to the Constitution speaks of ‘promoting’ the general welfare, not providing it. The Bill of Rights delineates a series of fundamental rights that individuals possess, by nature, and that government shall not infringe. Free health care is not one of them… If someone is indigent, we don’t let him die on the sidewalk outside a hospital. We treat that person, as we should. We’ll even send an ambulance to get him. But whether the money to pay for this comes from taxpayers, private benefactors or by shifting the cost to other patients, it’s still charity. Health care isn’t a right. Neither are food stamps, housing subsidies or welfare. They’re all charity. Distributing homes, cars, lawyers or health care via a random lottery isn’t practical; it’s socialism. And socialism is doomed to failure because it lacks incentives and rewards for individual productivity and excellence. In the absence of that, it ultimately collapses when it runs out of the means to spend other people’s money.”
10	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""Capturing and storing carbon uses lots of energy, anywhere from 10-40% of a power station's capacity. An energy penalty of just 20% would require the construction of an extra power station for every four built. These reductions in efficiency will require more coal to be mined, transported, and burned, for a power station to produce the same amount of energy as it did without CCS. CCS will also use more precious resources. Power stations with capture technology will need 90% more freshwater than those without...  As long as CO2 is in geological sites, there is a risk of leakage. While it is not currently possible to quantify the exact risks, any CO2 release has the potential to impact the surrounding environment; air, groundwater or soil. Continuous leakage, even at rates as low as 1%, could negate climate mitigation efforts...  Spending money on CSS is diverting urgent funding away from renewable energy solutions for the climate crisis... investing in a renewable energy future would save US$180 billion annually and cut CO2 emissions in half by 2050...  The urgency of the climate crisis means solutions must be ready for large-scale deployment in the short-term. CCS simply cannot deliver in time. The technology is highly speculative, risky and unlikely to be technically feasible in the next twenty years. Letting CCS be used as a smokescreen for building new coal-fired power stations is unacceptable and irresponsible. 'Capture ready' coal plants pose a significant threat to the climate.  The world can fight climate change but only if it reduces its dependence on fossil fuels, particularly coal. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are safe, cost effective solutions that carry none of the risks of CCS, and are available today to cut emissions and save the climate."""
01	Should Marijuana Be a Medical Option?	had steadily reviewed the scientific literature on medical marijuana from the United States and thought it was fairly unimpressive. Reading these papers five years ago, it was hard to make a case for medicinal marijuana. I even wrote about this in a TIME magazine article, back in 2009, titled ‘Why I would Vote No on Pot.’ Well, I am here to apologize. I apologize because I didn’t look hard enough, until now. I didn’t look far enough. I didn’t review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis… I mistakenly believed the Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a schedule 1 substance because of sound scientific proof. Surely, they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category of the most dangerous drugs that have ‘no accepted medicinal use and a high potential for abuse.’ They didn’t have the science to support that claim, and I now know that when it comes to marijuana neither of those things are true. It doesn’t have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications. In fact, sometimes marijuana is the only thing that works… We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and I apologize for my own role in that.” [Editor’s Note: Prior to Dr. Gupta’s pro statement on Aug. 8, 2013, he expressed a con position as indicated in his Nov. 6, 2006 statement in the opposite column.]

The inheritance of these diseases is different from the classic mendelian mode of transmission of monogenic diseases (related to or controlled by one gene). The phenotype of complex diseases reflects the multifactorial effect of all contributing genes (polygenic) and all environmental factors.”

10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“Drone strikes are causing more and more Yemenis to hate America and join radical militants; they are not driven by ideology but rather by a sense of revenge and despair… Anti-Americanism is far less prevalent in Yemen than in Pakistan. But rather than winning the hearts and minds of Yemeni civilians, America is alienating them by killing their relatives and friends. Indeed, the drone program is leading to the Talibanization of vast tribal areas and the radicalization of people who could otherwise be America’s allies in the fight against terrorism in Yemen… Yemeni tribes are generally quite pragmatic and are by no means a default option for radical religious groups seeking a safe haven. However, the increasing civilian toll of drone strikes is turning the apathy of tribal factions into anger… Certainly, there may be short-term military gains from killing militant leaders in these strikes, but they are minuscule compared with the long-term damage the drone program is causing. A new generation of leaders is spontaneously emerging in furious retaliation to attacks on their territories and tribes. This is why Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is much stronger in Yemen today than it was a few years ago. In 2009, A.Q.A.P. had only a few hundred members and controlled no territory; today it has, along with Ansar al-Sharia, at least 1,000 members and controls substantial amounts of territory… America’s counterterrorism policy here is not only making Yemen less safe by strengthening support for A.Q.A.P., but it could also ultimately endanger the United States and the entire world.”
01	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Concealed carry laws have not contributed to a big increase in gun ownership. Nor has allowing citizens the right to carry firearms for self-protection led to the negative consequences claimed by critics. In fact, these laws have lowered violent crime rates and increased the general level of knowledge concerning the rights, responsibilities and laws of firearm ownership. Putting unarmed citizens at the mercy of armed and violent criminals was never a good idea. Now that the evidence is in, we know that concealed carry is a social good.”
01	Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?	“Lifting the embargo won’t normalize relations, but instead legitimize — and wave the white flag to — Fidel’s 50-year fight against the Yanquis, further lionizing the dictator and encouraging the Latin American Left. The last thing we should do is to fill the pockets of a regime that’ll use those profits to keep a jackboot on the neck of the Cuban people. The political and human-rights situation in Cuba is grim enough already… The embargo has stifled Havana’s ambitions ever since the Castros lost their Soviet sponsorship in the early 1990s. Anyone noticed the lack of trouble Cuba has caused internationally since then? Contrast that with the 1980s some time… The US embargo remains a matter of principle — and an appropriate response to Cuba’s brutal repression of its people. Giving in to evil only begets more of it. Haven’t we learned that yet? Until we see progress in loosing the Cuban people from the yoke of the communist regime, we should hold firm onto the leverage the embargo provides.”
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“I went to college because I wanted to do the things I believed only college graduates could do. Visions of handsome jobs, alumni networks, and all-night parties filled my teenage mind. What I realized is that the fantasy isn’t the college degree. The fantasy is the path to success a college education is supposed to open. It turns out you can skip college entirely and learn more than your peers ever will. …Education is not a means to an end. It’s not something you do for twelve years so you can get into a university, and then something you do for four more years so you can get a job sitting at a desk forty hours per week. Learning is a lifelong process. It happens all the time. It starts before we are born and continues until the day we die.”

In the worst case scenario, the architectural weaknesses incorporated in these voting terminals allow a sophisticated attacker to develop an 'offense in depth' approach in which each compromised layer will also become the guardian against clean-up efforts in the other layers. This kind of deep attack is extremely persistent and it is noteworthy that the layers can conceal the contamination very effectively should the attacker wish that... The three-level attack is the worst possible attack. However, each layer can also be used to deploy a stand-alone attack...  It is important to understand that these attacks are permanent in nature, surviving through the election cycles. Therefore, the contamination can happen at any point of the device's life cycle and remain active and undetected from the point of contamination on through multiple election cycles and even software upgrade cycles."""

Uranium, which must be removed from the ground, is used to fuel nuclear reactors. Uranium mining, which creates serious health and environmental problems, has disproportionately impacted indigenous people because much of the world's uranium is located under indigenous land. Uranium miners experience higher rates of lung cancer, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases.

10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“The cessation of observed global warming for the past decade or so has shown how exaggerated NASA’s and most other computer predictions of human-caused warming have been—and how little correlation warming has with concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. As many scientists have pointed out, variations in global temperature correlate much better with solar activity and with complicated cycles of the oceans and atmosphere. There isn’t the slightest evidence that more carbon dioxide has caused more extreme weather… The current levels of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere, approaching 400 parts per million, are low by the standards of geological and plant evolutionary history. Levels were 3,000 ppm, or more, until the Paleogene period (beginning about 65 million years ago). For most plants, and for the animals and humans that use them, more carbon dioxide, far from being a ‘pollutant’ in need of reduction, would be a benefit… We know that carbon dioxide has been a much larger fraction of the earth’s atmosphere than it is today, and the geological record shows that life flourished on land and in the oceans during those times.

Yet for all this connectivity, new research suggests that we have never been lonelier (or more narcissistic) – and that this loneliness is making us mentally and physically ill… What Facebook has revealed about human nature – and this is not a minor revelation – is that a connection is not the same thing as a bond, and that instant and total connection is no salvation, no ticket to a happier, better world or a more liberated version of humanity. Solitude used to be good for self-reflection and self-reinvention. But now we are left thinking about who we are all the time, without ever really thinking about who we are.

And this could be catastrophic for anyone with a less-than-perfect image of themselves… There’s also the problem of students’ squelched individuality. Schools spend so much time trying to keep their students under control that they end up squashing the sparks that some of those kids were born with… Uniforms jeopardize the ability of America’s youth to express themselves, to become the people that they want to be.

01	Can a Child’s Relationship with His or Her Parents Cause Homosexuality?	psychoanalytic hypothesis for the connection between poor early father-son relationship and homosexuality is that during the critical gender-identity phase of development, the boy perceives the father as rejecting. As a result, he grows up failing to fully identify with his father and the masculinity he represents… One likely cause for ‘failure to identify’ is a narcissistic injury inflicted by the father onto the son (who is usually temperamentally sensitive) during the pre-oedipal stage of the boy’s development… The hurt manifests itself as a defensive detachment from masculinity in the self, and in others. As an adult, the homosexual is often characterized by this complex which takes the form of ‘the hurt little boy.'”
01	Does Obamacare Raise Any Federal Taxes? - YES	"""It's certainly true that the health care law would raise taxes on some Americans, particularly those with higher incomes. The law includes a Medicare payroll tax of 0.9 percent on income over $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for couples, and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for those earning that much. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the biggest chunk of revenue — $210.2 billion — comes from those taxes.  There are other taxes in the health care law — including an excise tax on the manufacturers of certain medical devices and on indoor tanning services. The health care law included $437.8 billion in tax revenue over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation's calculations. Republicans tend to add in fees on individuals who don't obtain health insurance (which the Supreme Court now agrees can be considered taxes) and businesses that don't provide it to bump that up to about $500 billion. Some taxes, such as those on medical devices, may or may not be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, but a large majority of Americans would not see any direct tax increase from the health care law."""

At that time, there were no such studies indicating that marijuana was safe and effective for any medical purpose.

Today, however, such a policy is acceptable, as long as the voice that is denied is that of the ex-felons.

In order to label a policy as a failure, there needs to be evidence of the success, or likely success, of alternatives. The fact is that decades of Canadian and European tourism to Cuba — with over three million visitors per year — has not eased the Castro regime’s repression, improved its respect for basic human rights or helped Cuba’s civil society gain any democratic space. To the contrary, it has increased repression and stabilized Castro’s regime… For Cubans, the consequence of lifting restrictions on U.S. tourism is more repression; for the United States, it’s having financed that repression.”

Raising the minimum wage has a number of serious and negative unintended consequences. Employers, especially small family and midsize businesses, will be disproportionately hurt by the extra costs incurred. The local neighborhood stores and businesses with razor-thin profits will be forced to raise prices to make up for the addition labor costs. With the increased prices, customers may elect to take their business elsewhere. Losing customers means losing income, which could result in the business having to layoff workers. Large corporations with big budgets will weigh the increased labor costs and elect to invest in technology to displace workers.

The record of central planning in the twentieth century has not been judged a success, and most centrally-planned economies collapsed towards the end of the last century. Perhaps the advocates of cap-and-trade can find some glimmer of hope in the persistence of Cuba and North Korea, which are both models of economies that have commendably low, indeed negligible, greenhouse gas emissions...  [A] cap-and-trade regime would be the single largest government intervention in the economy and in people's lives since the Second World War. That was the last time—and we hope it remains the last time—when people had to present ration coupons in order to buy gasoline (and many other products including cars, tires, sugar, coffee, meat, cheese, butter, and shoes). While the debate has focused on costs, far too little attention has been paid to the extent that political and economic freedoms would be lost or impinged upon under a cap-and-trade regime...  Many promoters of cap-and-trade have claimed that the costs will turn out to be much lower than mainstream economic models have predicted. A few have even claimed that cap-and-trade will be a net benefit to the economy. In reality, the costs of cap-and-trade to consumers will be much higher than the net loss of GDP predicted by the models...  [F]or many advocates, the primary attraction of cap-and-trade appears not to be reducing emissions, but rather the promise of colossal transfers of wealth from consumers to big business special interests and to government...

But we know that only about 38% of the time is the identical twin brother homosexual. Genes are responsible for an indirect influence, but on average, they do not force people into homosexuality… For perspective, it is valuable to compare genetic contributions to homosexuality with the question – is a girl genetically compelled to become pregnant at 15? Her genes might give her physical characteristics that make her attractive to boys – but whether she gets pregnant will depend greatly on… some influence from the environment (in this case a boy)… The effects of genes on behaviors are very indirect because genes make proteins, not preferences.”

01	Should the Death Penalty Be Abolished or Paused (Moratorium) Because of the Alleged Possibility of an Innocent Person Being Executed?	"""For a state to be properly using capital punishment, it needs to be following those guidelines that are found in the Bible. There do need, in our mind, to be clear evidences of guilt. It is not for government to use for its own ends. It is not proper for some governments to victimize others for its own purposes. There is supposed to be justice involved in this, and we believe that that's justice related to the way God calls for justice...  Our greatest concern about capital punishment is the concern that's been shared here and the concern that I think everyone shares. And that is the possibility that someone who's innocent might be executed. We are not oblivious to that accusation, to that concern as being raised about capital punishment today. And so, in our resolution the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, Orthodox Union (OU) resolution is calling for a nation-wide moratorium on the death penalty."""
10	Does Marijuana Use Increase the Risk of Psychosis (Including Schizophrenia)?	results of the current study suggest that having an increased familial morbid risk for schizophrenia may be the underlying basis for schizophrenia in cannabis users and not cannabis use by itself… This study aimed to determine whether people who use cannabis during adolescence have a greater risk for developing schizophrenia because they have an increased familial risk for the illness, and thus have a genetic predisposition for developing it regardless of cannabis use. If this is the case, we would expect to find a significantly higher morbid risk for schizophrenia in the relatives of people who develop schizophrenia compared to the relatives of non-schizophrenia controls, regardless of whether they do or do not use cannabis. The results of the current study, both when analyzed using morbid risk and family frequency calculations, suggest that having an increased familial risk for schizophrenia is the underlying basis for schizophrenia in these samples and not the cannabis use. While cannabis may have an effect on the age of onset of schizophrenia it is unlikely to be the cause of illness.”

None of this happened...   Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and AIDS increased. This was due to the fact that medical authorities examined only one of the partners in the sex act, which was self-defeating. Also, favourable medical results provided a false sense of security to clients, prostitutes and controllers. Medical examinations also provoked hostility and decreased cooperation from prostitutes who moved around too often to be monitored. If one did become infected with a sexually transmitted disease, another prostitute would replace her for the medical check up, using the infected woman's medical card."""

In today’s world of palliative medicine, physical suffering at the end of life can very often be avoided. But there is another type of suffering, which in my viewpoint, is even worse. It is called anticipatory suffering, and it includes the depression and anxiety that accompanies fear of death and fear of what is believed to be the inevitable suffering that comes with end of life. Death is perhaps the most personal intimate event of any lifetime -- and fear is a horrible form of suffering. For those who fear a prolonged and/or suffering death, this type of legislation provides a potent medicine. Opponents focus on the actual end of life medications and how they could be misused, when the thing we may be better served to focus on is the placebo effect that occurs for those who never take the medications -- but find their suffering relieved by the simple knowing that they have a choice."""
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	Drones limit the scope and scale of military action. Since the 9/11 attacks, the main threats to US security are decentralized terrorist networks operating in countries around the world, not large countries fighting with massive air, ground, and sea armies. Invading Pakistan, Yemen, or Somalia to capture relatively small terrorist groups would lead the United States to expensive conflict, responsibility for destabilizing those governments, large numbers of civilian casualties, empowerment of enemies who view the United States as an occupying imperialist power, US military deaths, and other unintended consequences. America's attempt to destroy al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan by invading and occupying the country resulted in a war that has dragged on for over 12 years. Using drone strikes against terrorists abroad allows the United States to achieve its goals at a fraction of the cost of an invasion in money, manpower, and lives. Read More

01	Does Obamacare's Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) Ration Medicare or Create “Death Panels”? - DEBATED	"""[Under Obamacare] the department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be empowered to impose so-called 'quality and efficiency' measures on health care providers, based on recommendations by the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is directed to force private health care spending below the rate of medical inflation. In many cases treatment that a doctor and patient deem needed or advisable to save that patient's life or preserve or improve the patient's health but which runs afoul of the imposed standards will be denied, even if the patient wants to pay for it.  The law empowers HHS to prevent older Americans from making up with their own funds for the $555 billion the law cuts from Medicare by refusing to permit senior citizens the choice of private-fee-for-service plans whose premiums are sufficient to provide unrationed care but which HHS, in its unlimited discretion, disallows.

So long as no one is coerced into invoking God, it makes little sense to accommodate the atheist's scruples by barring everyone else from saying words that he alone finds to be metaphysically empty. Complete subjective inclusion is impossible, so if our goal is to include as many people as possible, we need to reach as widely as possible by letting the ordinary democratic process take its course. The Jehovah's Witnesses, who in the 1940's fought for the right not to salute the flag, never insisted that the salute or the pledge should be abolished altogether - they just wanted their children to be exempt from a mandatory ritual that violated their consciences and hence their religious liberty."""

10	Is It Relevant to Look at the Animal Kingdom to Determine if Human Same-Sex Behavior is “Natural”?	seemingly ‘homosexual’ acts among animals are in accordance with animal nature, then parental killing of offspring and intra-species devouring are also in accordance with animal nature. Bringing man into the equation complicates things further. Are we to conclude that filicide and cannibalism are according to human nature?… The animal kingdom is no place for man to seek a blueprint for human morality… The fact that man has a body and sensitive life in common with animals does not mean he is strictly an animal. Nor does it mean that he is a half-animal. Man’s rationality pervades the wholeness of his nature so that his sensations, instincts and impulses are not purely animal but have that seal of rationality which characterizes them as human. Thus, man is characterized not by what he has in common with animals, but by what differentiates him from them. This differentiation is fundamental, not accidental. Man is a rational animal. Man’s rationality is what makes human nature unique and fundamentally distinct from animal nature.”

Furthermore, the phrase 'under God,' like all other phrases in the Pledge, has a distinctive meaning: that this country is presently a nation 'under God,' not a historical acknowledgment that it was founded under a god...   The use of the current version of the Pledge in public schools violates this Court's coercion analysis. Reciting 'under God' is a religious act. Children, while theoretically having the right to opt out of reciting the Pledge, may not do so because of fear of exposure as outsiders, because they do not have the capacity to do so, or because they wish not to appear unpatriotic to their teacher and classmates.

We simply cannot continue to ignore this. 400,000 cases every year isn't a trivial distraction. It's a real part of our illegal immigration problem. We must face the fact that the current policy of birthright citizenship is a huge magnet for more illegal crossings into our country. And unfortunately, that's often at the hands of very dangerous people.   This magnet attracts women from Mexico and Central America to make the dangerous trek north, often in the hands of 'coyotes' or human smugglers and drug cartels. These women frequently put their lives into the hands of criminal gangs, some who make a living on human trafficking.   Then there's the growing birth tourism industry.

10	Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence?	"""Because many immigrants to the United States, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, are young men who arrive with very low levels of formal education, popular stereotypes tend to associate them with higher rates of crime and incarceration. The fact that many of these immigrants enter the country through unauthorized channels or overstay their visas often is framed as an assault against the 'rule of law,' thereby reinforcing the impression that immigration and criminality are linked. This association has flourished in a post-9/11 climate of fear and ignorance where terrorism and undocumented immigration often are mentioned in the same breath.  However, data from the census and other sources show that for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants, even those who are the least educated. This holds true especially for the Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans who make up the bulk of the undocumented population. The problem of crime in the United States is not 'caused' or even aggravated by immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

For the most part, these people are law-abiding, productive members of our communities, contributing much to LA's boundless dynamism, diversity and culture... In other words, the undocumented population of LA County has deep roots in the community. Rounding up thousands of these people would cause great social distress…  Beyond that, states and cities have a good reason to become sanctuaries while Trump occupies the West Wing: It improves public safety. If local law enforcement were to join the Trump administration in a broad roundup of the undocumented population, it would only drive people underground, making them reluctant to cooperate with the police, report crimes, or serve as witnesses for fear of being deported.

That waxing and waning demonstrates the organization’s success at its sole endeavor, defending and preserving the individual freedoms granted through the Bill of Rights. Since its creation in 1920, the ACLU has been part of many milestone cases that help define and refine individual rights within a democratic society. It is because of a 1969 case the ACLU carried to the Supreme Court, Brandenburg v. Ohio, that we have a social definition of when an individual’s right to free speech threatens the public good, ‘imminent lawless action.’ That case involved a member of the Ku Klux Klan, reminding us once again that, just as recently in Charlottesville, the organization doesn’t just defend liberals or radicals, but everyone. It’s also worth noting that helping groups obtain halls or permits to express their political opinions is only one part of what the ACLU does. It has also challenged literary censorship, segregation, cruel and unusual punishments, gender inequality, and violations of the right to privacy and freedom of religion.

10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""This path to peaceful dying rests on the illusion that a society can safely put in the hands of physicians the power directly and deliberately to take life, euthanasia, or to assist patients in taking their own life, physician-assisted suicide... It threatens to add still another sad chapter to an already sorry human history of giving one person the liberty to take the life of another. It perpetuates and pushes to an extreme the very ideology of control--the goal of mastering life and death--that created the problems of modern medicine in the first place. Instead of changing the medicine that generates the problem of an intolerable death (which, in almost all cases, good palliative medicine could do), allowing physicians to kill or provide the means to take one's own life simply treats the symptoms, all the while reinforcing, and driving us more deeply into, an ideology of control."""
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""If a house is on fire, you do not wait for it to burn to the ground before trying to save the family trapped inside. The situation we face today with Obamacare is no different: It is on the verge of collapse, buckling under the weight of its own toxic mix of mandates and regulations, and many of our fellow Americans are trapped inside...  The statistics tell the story that we know all too well. Since Obamacare's central rules took effect, premiums for individual market plans have doubled. At the same time, insurance coverage rates have fallen far short of predictions. The Congressional Budget Office had projected that 23 million Americans would be enrolled in the law's healthcare exchanges this year; the reality is that the number of Americans currently enrolled is less than half that estimate.  Patients increasingly don't have a choice of insurers, either. In one-third of all counties in America, there is only one insurance company participating on the exchanges; in another 37 percent of counties, there are just two. The situation is especially acute in rural areas, where prices are high and access to care is already a struggle."""

01	Are Felon Disenfranchisement Laws a Form of Racial Discrimination?	"""Felon disenfranchisement thus has to be viewed as one of the many side effects of the peculiar history of racial politics in the United States.   In the abstract, felon disenfranchisement can be separated from race: state laws are literally race neutral, in that all who are convicted of felonies are subject to the same sanction. Moreover, modern defenders of the practice certainly draw upon nonracial reasons for their position, and we do not intend in this analysis to imply anything to the contrary. This does not, however, mean that there is no connection between race and felon disenfranchisement.   Indeed, when we ask the question of how we got to the point where American practice can be so out of line with the rest of the democratic world, the most plausible answer we can supply is that of race."""

We call upon the Palestinian people to acknowledge the right of Jews to maintain their own homeland in the pre-1967 borders of the state of Israel, with Jewish control over the Jewish section of Jerusalem (including French Hill and Mt. Scopus and the Jewish Quarter of the Old City) and the Western Wall, and unimpeded access to the cemetery on the Mount of Olives...  At this point in time, the NSP [Network of Spiritual Progressives] and the TIKKUN Community is supporting a two-state rather than a bi-national solution to the Israel-Palestinian crisis, even though some members of our community believe that such a bi-national state is the only way to achieve social justice for Palestinians."""
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“You deprive kids of recess, eliminate music and the arts, cut back the class meetings and discussions of current events, offer less time to read books for pleasure, squeeze out the field trips and interdisciplinary projects and high-quality electives, spend enough time teaching test-taking tricks, and, you bet, it’s possible to raise [test] scores. But that result is meaningless at best. When a school or district reports better test results this year than last, knowledgeable parents and other observers respond by saying, ‘So what?’ (because higher test scores do not necessarily reflect higher quality teaching and learning) – or even, ‘Uh oh’ (because higher test scores may indicate lower quality teaching and learning). And once you realize that the tests are unreliable indicators of quality, then what possible reason would there be to subject kids – usually African American and Latino kids – to those mind-numbing, spirit-killing, regimented instructional programs that were designed principally to raise test scores? If your only argument in favor of such a program is that it improves results on deeply flawed tests, you haven’t offered any real argument at all.” [Editor’s Note: In a June 8, 2012 email to ProCon.org, Alfie Kohn confirmed that he remains “Con” to our core question.]

10	Does Drinking Milk Contribute to Heart Disease?	"""Claim: Dairy products increase the risk of heart disease.  Facts: If you consume lots of whole milk and cheese, you're likely to raise your blood cholesterol levels. That's true, however, of any foods rich in saturated fat and cholesterol. Milk's opponents talk as if all milk is still whole milk. But more and more dairy products these days are nonfat or low-fat, and thus do not raise cholesterol levels significantly. In fact, there's some evidence that certain substances in milk may help lower cholesterol somewhat...  Milk opponents often quote a paper in Alternative Medicine Review [1998 study by William Grant] that indicted milk, even nonfat milk, as a cause of heart disease. But that article was simplistic and misleading. It found an association between milk consumption and heart disease in population studies from 32 countries, but the data did not allow the researcher to take into consideration many of the other factors that can affect the risk of heart disease."""

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Because students’ self-expression on clothing generally does not disrupt class, uniforms are an inefficient and unnecessary bureaucracy that requires school officials to be worried about what everyone is wearing. Instead, school officials should only be concerned with clothing that is actually disruptive – which both dress codes and simple common sense are more than adequate to handle… In conflict with the First Amendment, school uniform policies create… an environment of sterilized uniformity scrubbed of the diversity so prized by our founding fathers. Perhaps more importantly, the façade of homogeneity in no way reflects the real world that students will enter immediately upon graduation from high school… Forcing students to dress and look alike flies in the face of the diversity of thought and rugged individualism that are the bedrock of our nation and our Constitution… [A]llowing students to choose their clothing is an empowering message from the schools that a student is a maturing person who is entitled to the most basic self-determination. In a freer learning environment, students begin with a sense of self-worth – rather than as identical captives without options. Giving kids a choice to express themselves not only acknowledges their individuality but creates the possibility for a relationship of mutual respect. So long as this parade of choices does not interrupt the school day, schools should be interested in nurturing, rather than standardizing, student expression.”

Prima facie, the penalty of death is likely to have a stronger effect as a deterrent to normal human beings than any other form of punishment, and there is some evidence (though no convincing statistical evidence) that this is in fact so.'"""

01	Should Health Checks Be Mandatory for Prostitutes?	"""The opponents of compulsory health check-ups should bear in mind that in our country there are many categories of employees that are obliged to undergo medical check-ups at regular intervals which means they cannot work if their health conditions are not found to be sound. On the contrary, it seems like in our country no one worries about the fact that HIV-positive prostitutes can go on working without anyone being able to stop them...  [T]he health check-ups would have an educational effect in that prostitutes could be more easily convinced to use condoms at all times, even when clients offer higher prices to have unprotected sex, and they would be induced to do so because they would be aware that if the regular check-ups determine that they are affected by a sexually-transmitted disease (not only HIV), they would have to stop working.  This is exactly what happens in Berlin and Amsterdam where it is virtually impossible for a client to have sex without a condom, because the prostitutes, who are obliged to undergo regular health check-ups, definitely refuse to do so."""

Especially is this meaningful as we regard today's world.

10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""Economic studies seem to indicate that the contribution of undocumented immigrants to the US economy is greater than their burden.  Undocumented immigrants pay sales tax on their purchases and property tax on their homes. Additionally an estimated three-quarters of undocumented immigrants pay income tax using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers or false Social Security numbers. These documents put workers 'on the books,' which means their employers must make required deductions from their pay. Each year, taxpayers who use incorrect or false Social Security numbers (the majority of them undocumented immigrants) contribute approximately $7 billion to Social Security and $1.5 billion to Medicare. Most of these workers were educated in their countries of origin and now the U.S. economy reaps the rewards of their work. Yet, undocumented workers are ineligible for most government benefits.   On average, all immigrants will pay $80,000 more in taxes per capita than they use in government benefits over their lifetime. These facts led the President's Council of Economic Advisers to declare in June 2007 that 'the long-run impact of immigration on public budgets is likely to be positive.'  Undocumented immigration also produces a net benefit at the state level. For example, approximately 13.9% of the nation's undocumented immigrants live in Texas. In 2006, the Texas Comptroller reported that undocumented immigrants paid about $424.7 million more in state revenues – including sales tax and school property tax – than they used in state services, including education and health care."""

Every time a prostitute is arrested, two more take her place. There's a bottomless market for their services. I'm sure some cops, lawyers and judges sometimes enter this market, but they can never admit it because it would undercut their authority to arrest, prosecute and punish those who gave them release the day before.  Whether one pays to participate in an orgy or to hire the services of a prostitute, I see no reason to bring in the heavy guns of the criminal law. When it comes to sex, I see only one legal rule of any real importance: for sex to be lawful there only needs to be consent, and it should not matter whether consent is secured by direct payment or weeks of expensive courtship with fine dining and false promises."""

01	Is Therapy Aimed at Changing Sexual Orientation Unethical?	if ‘reparative therapies’ were able to change the sexual orientation of a small minority of people upon whom they are used, their ethical basis is questionable. These treatments are simply an extension of society’s prejudices against gay men and lesbians. Typically, people who want to become heterosexual are reacting to society’s intense antigay hostility. Often, they are pressured to change by their family or their religious group. Therapists have an ethical duty to resist such coercion. Instead of reinforcing or promoting the stigma attached to homosexuality, therapists should help gay people to understand their sexual orientation and learn how to lead a happy life.”

Remember, he defied the United Nations and the international community for 12 years. He was an individual that possessed chemical and biological weapons, and sought to reconstitute his nuclear weapons program.

Above all, they are uneasy at Britain going out on a limb on a military adventure without a broader international coalition and against the hostility of many of our traditional allies... It has been a favourite theme of commentators that this House no longer occupies a central role in British politics. Nothing could better demonstrate that they are wrong than for this House to stop the commitment of troops in a war that has neither international agreement nor domestic support.

The voting process could be 'intentionally' disrupted by voters who claim the paper receipt does not match how they voted, thereby putting the entire voting process in question.

This perception is strengthened by the physical acts that accompany the Pledge, such as turning to view the flag.

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	Under the gold standard, income levels in the United States were rising much faster and unemployment levels were lower. In the decades prior to the United States abandoning the gold standard (1950-1968), the real median income for males rose 2.7% per year. Since leaving the gold standard in 1971, the average median income has only increased 0.2% per year. [28] If the gold standard had not been abandoned in 1971, and income levels had continued to grow at the prior rates, the average median family income today would be about 50% higher. [27] In addition, unemployment levels were lower in the decades leading up to the United States abandoning the gold standard. Between 1944 and 1971, while on a partial gold standard, unemployment averaged 5%. From 1971 to present, unemployment levels have averaged 6% under the fiat money standard. [20] Read More
01	"From a Legal Perspective, Do the Words ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Improperly Endorse Religion?"	"""Schoolchildren would reasonably perceive the Pledge as expressing religious belief and affirming a religious ideal. They are unlikely to perceive 'under God' as merely descriptive of historical or cultural fact...  Moreover, it would take a very subtle six-year-old to view the averment that ours is 'one Nation under God' - when proclaimed as part of a daily classroom ritual, and beginning with the words 'I pledge' - as simply an 'acknowledgment' of beliefs that other people hold or once held and that might or might not be true...  Social science research has indeed found that, insofar as young schoolchildren asribe any meaning to the Pledge, they perceive 'under God' as expressing religious belief...  The fact that 'under God' is included in a patriotic text does not diminish but compounds the constitutional violation. Far from imbuing the phrase with redeeming 'secular purposes'... the phrase impermissibly conditions an expression of patriotism on affirmation of religion and religious belief... As the Court has emphasized, the Establishment Clause prohibits government from 'making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community'... The pressure on a child to affirm religion and religious belief by reciting the Pledge is only magnified by the fact that refraining from reciting it can be construed by teacher and classmates as lack of patriotism."""

Since the world’s great religion scholars can’t agree on what a religion is, it’s absurd to ask a bunch of accountants, no matter how well-meaning… [T]he IRS famously caved and awarded the Church of Scientology tax-exempt status. Never mind that the Scientology is secretive, or that it charges for its courses; or that its leader, David Miscavige, lives like a pasha. Indeed, many clergy have mid-six-figure salaries — many university presidents, seven-figure salaries — and the IRS doesn’t trouble their tax-exempt status. And many churches and synagogues sit on exceedingly valuable tracts of land (walk up and down Fifth Avenue to see what I mean). The property taxes they aren’t paying have to be drawn from business owners and private citizens — in a real sense, you and I are subsidizing Mormon temples, Muslims mosques, Methodist churches.”

Allowing hockey players to fight creates a culture in which fighting is respected and valued, according to a study in the journal Men and Masculinities, which stated, ""The findings of this study indicate that interpersonal aggression is common in the lives of these hockey players, both on and off the ice."" [31] Matthew Sekeres, writer at Globe and Mail, said that ""Hockey is a sport that solves its problems with violence."" [32] When the use of violence is approved and legitimized among hockey players, they are more likely to participate in other forms of violence. For instance, a study found that people seeking a career in professional hockey are more likely to commit sexual assault and have abusive relationships than non-hockey players and people who play hockey as a hobby. [33][37][38] Researchers have found that hockey violence makes fans more hostile in the stands and off the rink. [34][35][36]"
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Consumers are informed by what they see online and on television from content and advertising. Consumers are actively bringing physicians information, asking about treatment options and even challenging decisions in an effort to manage their own health. Searching online across the healthcare continuum can shape an understanding for symptoms, treatment options and alternatives and even provide solutions on how to access and pay for therapies or medications… It’s a pretty simple formula: information + education = participation—by being a participant in the management of a health journey, the voice of the consumer will be heard and the physician will help guide… Advertising done responsibly can participate and help provide value and utility without selling.”
01	Does Christianity Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	crux of the matter, it seems to me, is simply that the Bible has no sexual ethic. There is no Biblical sex ethic. Instead, it exhibits a variety of sexual mores, some of which changed over the thousand year span of biblical history. Mores are unreflective customs accepted by a given community. Many of the practices that the Bible prohibits, we allow, and many that it allows, we prohibit. The Bible knows only a love ethic, which is constantly being brought to bear on whatever sexual mores are dominant in any given country, or culture, or period. Christian morality, after all, is not a iron chastity belt for repressing urges, but a way of expressing the integrity of our relationship with God. It is the attempt to discover a manner of living that is consistent with who God created us to be. For those of same-sex orientation, as for heterosexuals, being moral means rejecting sexual mores that violate their own integrity and that of others, and attempting to discover what it would mean to live by the love ethic of Jesus… Where the Bible mentions homosexual behavior at all, it clearly condemns it. I freely grant that. The issue is precisely whether that Biblical judgment is correct. The Bible sanctioned slavery as well, and nowhere attacked it as unjust. Are we prepared to argue today that slavery is biblically justified?… In the light of that [God’s] supernal compassion, whatever our position on gays, the gospel’s imperative to love, care for, and be identified with their sufferings is unmistakably clear.”

01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Exposure to violent video games is linked to lower empathy and decreased kindness. Empathy, the ability to understand and enter into another's feelings is believed to inhibit aggressive behavior. In a study of 150 fourth and fifth graders by Jeanne Funk, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at the University of Toledo, violent video games were the only type of media associated with lower empathy. [32] A study published in the American Psychological Association's Psychological Bulletin found that exposure to violent video games led to a lack of empathy and prosocial behavior (positive actions that benefit others). [66][65] Eight independent tests measuring the impact of violent video games on prosocial behavior found a significant negative effect, leading to the conclusion that ""exposure to violent video games is negatively correlated with helping in the real world."" [61] Several studies have found that children with high exposure to violent media display lower moral reasoning skills than their peers without that exposure. [32][69] A meta-analysis of 130 international studies with over 130,000 participants concluded that violent video games ""increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, and aggressive behaviors, and decrease empathic feelings and prosocial behaviors.""

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Teachers are a crucial component of the quality of education that students receive. Research shows that teacher quality has a greater impact on student achievement than many other factors such as class size, teacher certification requirements, and per-pupil spending. Some students… get stuck in classrooms with teachers who, year after year, fail to educate or inspire their students. These persistently low-performing teachers contribute to a devastating and unjustifiable inequality in our public educational system. In Los Angeles Unified, the country’s second largest school district, African-American and Latino students are two to three times more likely to have a teacher in the bottom quartile of effectiveness than their white and Asian peers. Research has revealed that Los Angeles schools in which ineffective teachers make up over 50 percent of the teaching staff are clustered in certain parts of the city… But the worst part of these inequalities is that we know exactly which laws are contributing to and exacerbating the problem. Teacher employment protections [tenure] in California so far exceed those in other States that dismissing a persistently ineffective teacher is next to impossible so costly, time-consuming, and unlikely to actually result in dismissal that administrators are prevented from even trying. Worse, when budget shortfalls force districts to implement layoffs, the statutes require districts to lay teachers off in reverse order of seniority, with no regard for skills, leadership or past performance in the classroom.”

10	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“I started writing about food because I was tired of vegetarians and vegans telling me I should stop eating meat all together as my carnivorous consumption was inhumane and contrary to humanities’ evolution as a species. I eat meat. I will continue to eat meat. And I think you should too… One of the strong arguments against eating meat is that great amount of food energy wasted every time an animal eats another animal (a 9-to-1 ratio), but in the case of cows that are grass-fed, they are eating biomass from which we cannot glean food calories. In addition, the energy to grow grass comes from the sun, which means cows are, in essence, converting the sun’s energy, through the venue of grass, into food energy that we can consume. And, importantly, grass fed beefy is mighty tasty. And to my final reason for eating meat: It tastes good. I crave it. I am lethargic both physically and mentally without it. I also have canine teeth. Vegetarians and vegans often say that humans have evolved to a point where they don’t need to eat meat to survive. While I would be able to live without meat, my life would not be as good. Just as cows can live on corn meal rather than grass, humans can live only plants, but maybe they shouldn’t. I believe there is a biological reason I crave meat: My body needs it… And so, I will now say again: I eat meat. I will continue to eat meat. And I think you should too.”

With respect to public acknowledgment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our Nation's historical practices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcerned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists.

Participants consuming 4 servings or more per day of any type of milk had an RR [relative risk] of 0.68 compared with those reporting 1 serving or less per week. Whole milk intake was associated with a modest increase in risk, while women who frequently consumed skim or low-fat milk had a significantly lower risk of developing PMS; the RR for women consuming 4 servings or more per day of skim or low-fat milk compared with those reporting 1 serving or less per week was 0.54. The relationship between milk intake and risk of PMS did not vary by level of calcium or vitamin D supplementation...  Findings from our nested case-control study suggest that a high dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium may lower the risk of incident PMS. We observed a significantly lower risk of developing PMS in women with high intakes of vitamin D and calcium from food sources, equivalent to about 4 servings per day of skim or low-fat milk...  The finding that frequent milk intake is protective against PMS is consistent with our results for calcium and vitamin D. Each serving of fortified milk contains approximately 300 mg of calcium and 100 IU of vitamin D; 4 servings per day would provide women with approximately the amount of calcium and vitamin D from food sources at which we saw a significantly lower risk of PMS. It is unclear why frequent consumption of skim or low-fat milk and whole milk may be differently related to PMS."""

The mechanisms underlying these contrasting responses remain unresolved.

01	Are Children Who Are Raised by Gay Parents More Likely to Be Gay Themselves?	think that although these studies can’t be used to make definitive statements, they are suggestive that homosexual parents are rearing disproportionate numbers of non-heterosexual children. This isn’t surprising since parents are the primary influencers of children… Based on the average found in the following nine studies, 14% of children raised by homosexual parents develop homosexual or bisexual preferences. These studies reported rates of non-heterosexuality ranging from 8% to 21%. The most frequently reported percentages were 14% and 16% (two studies each). For comparison purposes, data from the best national surveys report that approximately 2% of the general population is non-heterosexual… The preceding nine studies suggest that children raised by homosexual or bisexual parents are approximately 7 times more likely than the general population to develop a non-heterosexual sexual preference.”
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	Tenure encourages the careful selection of qualified and effective teachers. Since it is difficult to remove tenured teachers, tenure encourages school administrators to take more care when making hiring decisions. Additionally, tenure prompts administrators to dismiss under-performing teachers before they achieve tenure and cannot be removed as easily. [19] Read More

The average per capita costs of the elderly are significantly higher than for younger people. Public policy must take account of, and work with, those averages... Age matters...   It matters when, as we can now see, meeting the health care costs of the elderly as a group begins to threaten the possibility of meeting the needs of other age groups. In the nature of the case, moreover, there are no fixed boundaries to the amount of money that can be spent combating the effects of biological aging and attempting to forestall death in old age. It is an unlimited frontier. One could say exactly the same thing about trying to save the life of low birthweight infants... There are no end of possibilities there as well, and thus, some very good reasons to set limits to those efforts... It is no more an anti-aging act than it is an anti-baby act to set limits (for instance, on neonatal care) in order to avoid pursuing unlimited, potentially ruinous possibilities."""
01	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Thanks to this law, more than twenty million Americans have gained the security and peace of mind of health insurance. Thanks to this law, more than ninety percent of Americans are insured – the highest rate in our history. Thanks to this law, the days when women could be charged more than men and Americans with pre-existing conditions could be denied coverage altogether are relics of the past. Seniors have bigger discounts on their prescription drugs. Young people can stay on their parents' plans until they turn 26 years old. And Americans who already had insurance received an upgrade as well – from free preventive care, like mammograms and vaccines, to improvements in the quality of care in hospitals that has averted nearly 100,000 deaths so far.  All of that is thanks to the Affordable Care Act. And all the while, since the law passed, the pace of health care inflation has slowed dramatically. Prices are still rising, just as they have every year for decades – but under this law, they’ve been rising at the slowest rate in fifty years. Families who get coverage through their employer are paying, on average, thousands of dollars less per year than if costs kept rising as fast as they were before the law. And reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a 'death spiral,' because while it's true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all. And so long as the law is properly administered, this market will remain stable. Likewise, this law is no 'job-killer,' because America's businesses went on a record-breaking streak of job growth in the seven years since I signed it.  So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act.”"

[32] A period of mandatory service could be a hardship for families and communities that would lose their young people who are already performing service by contributing to the household income, babysitting for neighbors, or caring for sick relatives. [33] Compulsory service would delay people's entry into the workforce, resulting in significant lost earnings for some.

The best plan is to say to somebody who has been here illegally, if you've been paying your taxes, and you've got a good criminal record, that you can pay a fine for being here illegally, and you can learn English, like the rest of us have done, and you can get in a citizenship line to apply for citizenship.

"""Despite the recent drop in oil price, we expect solar electricity to become competitive with retail electricity in an increasing number of markets globally due to declining solar panel costs as well as improving financing and customer acquisition costs. Unsubsidized rooftop solar electricity costs between $0.08-$0.13/kWh, 30-40% below retail price of electricity in many markets globally. In markets heavily dependent on coal for electricity generation, the ratio of coal based wholesale electricity to solar electricity cost was 7:1 four years ago. This ratio is now less than 2:1 and could likely approach 1:1 over the next 12-18 months...  The economics of solar have improved significantly due to the reduction in solar panel costs, financing costs and balance of system costs. Overall solar system costs have declined at ~15% CAGR [compound annual growth rate] over the past 8 years and we expect another 40% cost reduction over the next 4-5 years."""

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“What we found was that higher minimum wages do not have adverse effects on employment, or the weeks or hours worked among minimum wage workers — even four years after minimum wages are increased. We didn’t find adverse employment effects among women and minority groups, either. As a result, we determined that the United States can raise pay to $15 an hour by 2024 without hurting jobs, even in low-wage states… Higher minimum wages reduce employee turnover costs and increase worker productivity. They raise consumer demand by increasing the purchasing power of workers. Low-wage employers, particularly in the restaurant industry, also absorb minimum wage costs through small price increases in restaurants. Those of us who eat in restaurants are able and willing to pay a few cents more for a typical meal, so restaurant sales go up even with the small price increases. Our research indicates that pay can increase to $15 an hour in low-wage states without losing jobs, that incomes will grow, and fewer children will grow up in poverty.”

10	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“[T]he way tenure works for public school teachers today is that once they have it, they have a job for life — regardless of performance. That, I would say, is what is harmful to children… I don’t think we need to reform tenure. I don’t think there is a need for tenure. Teachers need to understand they are not going to be discriminated against. If they feel they’ve been unfairly terminated, they need to have a process by which they can address that issue. School districts need to ensure firings are not happening in an unfair manner. But all of those things can happen without tenure being in place. Part of the reason we started StudentsFirst is to always look at policies from a kid-centric point of view. If there is any protection in public education, it should be for the children, not for the adults… The focus has to be on accountability, and it has to be on performance. If, at some point in teachers’ careers, they are not performing in a way that positively impacts student achievement levels, there has to be a way for a school district to remove them.”

Education for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion...  At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal aliens. At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs associated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens. Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns...  With many state budgets in deficit, policymakers have an obligation to look for ways to reduce the fiscal burden of illegal migration. California, facing a budget deficit of $14.4 billion in 2010-2011, is hit with an estimated $21.8 billion in annual expenditures on illegal aliens.

And if that's the case, then what's the difference, philosophically, in where that line is drawn - that more or less substances are deemed banned? The only difference is a world where the semblance of fair play remains, where sports remain the end product of hard work, determination and talent, and a world where sports becomes merely pharmaceutically fueled entertainment. We can choose that world if we like, but with the knowledge that the cost is sports as inspirational and transformative, indicative of the best traits of us as people.

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Some English schools (and politicians) see uniform as a quick fix for a range of problems. However, serious discipline and academic issues are unlikely to be solved by nostalgically resurrecting the blazer or draconian decrees issued from the headmaster’s study regarding skirt length. Students flourish when they’re treated as free-range individuals, rather than battery-hen units that must conform. Examples from around the world show that high standards of discipline, team spirit and attainment are not synonymous with school uniform. Importantly, the lack of uniform is widely debated among our students – they’re aware of the danger of defining individuality in terms of clothing, and of issues such as body image and self esteem. As media savvy individuals they are suspicious of attempts by some schools to use uniform as part of their corporate identity and brand.”
01	Should Teachers Get Tenure?	“Unions don’t grant tenure – administrators do. Too many school boards and superintendents attack tenure rather than hold their own managers accountable for hiring and supervising teachers and, if necessary, removing those who don’t make the grade. Tenure is granted by the board of education on recommendation of the superintendent –but many schools do a poor job of evaluating and supporting teachers… Tenure’s not about protecting ‘bad’ teachers; it’s about protecting good teachers. What would happen to teachers without tenure? They could — and would — be fired for virtually any reason. It’s not hard to imagine teachers being dismissed because they failed the daughter of an influential businessman or because the school board president’s nephew needed a job. In these fiscally troubled times, what would stop a school board from replacing a veteran teacher at the top of the pay scale with a first-year teacher — simply to save money? Tenure is the first line of defense against attacks on academic freedom. Teachers can engage their students in a free exchange of ideas only if they are protected from arbitrary dismissal for doing so. Tenure prevents school boards from arbitrarily dismissing teachers for holding political, religious or social views with which they disagree. It protects academic freedom the way the First Amendment protects freedom of the press.”

01	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""[T]he net fiscal cost of immigration ranges from $11 billion to $22 billion per year, with most government expenditures on immigrants coming from state and local coffers, while most taxes paid by immigrants go to the federal treasury. The net deficit is caused by a low level of tax payments by immigrants, because they are disproportionately low-skilled and thus earn low wages, and a higher rate of consumption of government services, both because of their relative poverty and their higher fertility. This is especially true of illegal immigration. Even though illegal aliens make little use of welfare, from which they are generally barred, the costs of illegal immigration in terms of government expenditures for education, criminal justice, and emergency medical care are significant. California has estimated that the net cost to the state of providing government services to illegal immigrants approached $3 billion during a single fiscal year. The fact that states must bear the cost of federal failure turns illegal immigration, in effect, into one of the largest unfunded federal mandates."""

10	Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?	“Even where immunization is generally mandatory, in a free democracy, there has almost always been the provision for parents with conscientious objections to withhold their children from the immunization program. When smallpox vaccination was made compulsory in the 19th century in the United Kingdom, it was the poor who suffered. If they persisted in refusing immunization, they were fined or even sent to jail, for inability to pay. On the other hand, the affluent simply paid their fines and the children remained unimmunized. It was not long before conscience clauses were introduced and any element of compulsion abolished in 1948 with the introduction of the National Health Service. In an era when people are less accepting of authority and do not expect to do something because the government says so, trying to enforce immunization may actually make matters worse and create martyrs. Those who have genuine religious objections are unlikely to allow their children to be immunized, whatever the penalty. Parents who are hesitating about their vaccine decision because of concerns over vaccine safety may change their minds if given time and an opportunity to discuss their concerns with a well-informed health professional.”

One corollary of the ‘social benefit’ theory that is often overlooked is what I have termed the ‘intangible benefit’ theory of tax exemption. This highlights the intangible and often unseen benefits provided by churches to the community. Things like reduced crime rates resulting from transformed lives, suicides prevented when people surrender to Christ, and people with destructive behavioral patterns that harm the community changing into hard-working and virtuous citizens who contribute to the well-being of the community. It is difficult to put a price tag on these types of intangible benefits provided by churches, but there is no question that they exist.”
01	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""Our report shows that the new health care law will have negative effects on the franchising industry's ability to grow and create much-needed jobs for the U.S. economy. We estimate that the law will negatively affect tens of thousands of franchise businesses, adding more than $6.4 billion in increased costs, not including the cost of regulatory compliance. Further, we estimate that the jobs of more than 3.2 million full-time employees in franchise businesses would be put at risk.  These effects can best be described cumulatively as anti-small business growth. The health care law unintentionally discourages franchisees from owning and operating multiple locations. The law creates a competitive disadvantage for franchisees who do own more than one or two locations. The employer mandate in the law provides an incentive for franchisors and franchisees to replace fulltime workers with part-time and temporary workers. It imposes another layer of regulatory burden on business owners as they attempt to understand and comply with the new law. It increases the cost of doing business for tens of thousands of business owners who are struggling to recover from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.

01	Will Increased Oil Drilling Help the US Solve Its Energy Crisis?	"""Meeting our nation's energy challenges - and responding to high prices Americans are paying at the pump - requires that we pursue an integrated set of solutions. We must moderate demand by using energy more efficiently. And we must also increase supplies by responsibly developing energy resources from a variety of different sources and locations - including right here in the United States.  It is estimated that there is enough oil and natural gas offshore and in non-wilderness and non-park lands in the United States - but currently ruled off-limits for production by the federal government - to fuel 50 million cars and heat nearly 100 million homes for the next 25 years...  If Congress were to expand the areas available for active exploration, we could make more domestic energy available to Americans in the future, while sending a strong positive supply signal to markets today, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. It would also strengthen U.S. energy security by further diversifying Americans' energy portfolio, and therefore mitigating the impact of a disruption in any one producing region of the world."""
01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	"The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford housing. According to a 2015 report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker must earn at least $15.50 an hour (over twice the federal minimum wage) to be able to afford to rent a ""modest"" one-bedroom apartment, and $19.35 for a two-bedroom unit (more than 2.5 times the minimum wage). The report stated: ""In no state can an individual working a typical 40-hour work week at the federal minimum wage afford a one- or two-bedroom apartment for his or her family."" In California in 2015, even a person earning the then state minimum wage of $9 per hour would need to work 92 hours a week to afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment. [34] In Rawlins County, Kansas, where rental costs are some of the most affordable in the country, a living wage including housing costs for one person with no dependents is estimated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be $9.35, 25.3% higher than the federal minimum wage and the state minimum wage of Kansas.

Therefore, I am fully supportive of such military action now.""  "
01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“A new gold standard is crucial. The disasters that the Federal Reserve and other central banks are inflicting on us with their funny-money policies are enormous and underappreciated. An unstable dollar is wreaking havoc on our capital markets, depriving us of money for productive enterprises and future enterprises while subsidizing government debt on a scale never before seen in U.S. history. The zero-interest-rate policy destroys capital by punishing savers and enabling the central bank to allocate where capital goes… What the Fed is doing through its binge buying of bonds is enabling Washington to consume our national wealth. Instead of creating new wealth we are beginning to destroy that which exists. No wonder tens of millions of people feel – rightly – that their real incomes are declining and their financial situations are coming under more pressure. In real terms the stock market is lower today than it was in the late 1990s, and even in absolute terms it still isn’t where it was in 2007. Can we move forward on a gold standard before a real catastrophe à la the 1930s results?… Currently the federal government wages a virtual jihad against any attempt by individuals or companies to create gold-based monetary instruments for commercial transactions… The combination of getting a serious debate on the gold standard going and sweeping away our legal tender laws barring competitive domestic currency would hasten the day that we’ll once again have a gold-based currency like that which did our country so much measurable good for 180 years.”

After an accusation, districts might find it expedient to quickly remove a teacher instead of investigating the matter and incurring potentially expensive legal costs. The thorough removal process mandated by tenure rules ensures that teachers are not removed without a fair hearing. [14] Read More

This executive amnesty was another example of the Obama Administration bypassing Congress to advance its radical agenda.   Nearly 40,000 DACA recipients have been given green cards and over 1,000 recipients have become U.S. citizens, despite the Obama Administration's initial pledge that the program would not confer such a path to citizenship. What’s more: DACA allowed aliens to leave and re-enter our country; removed eligibility bars from Social Security, Medicare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit; and conferred eligibility for state benefits like driver's licenses and unemployment insurance.   As I have often said, the Executive Branch cannot simply sidestep the people's elected representatives in the Legislative Branch. I am glad President Trump is defending the separation of powers, preserving the rule of law, and ending the unconstitutional DACA program."""
01	Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?	“We must use technology to empower teachers and improve the way students learn. At its best, education technology will change the face of education by helping teachers manage the classroom and personalize instruction… If you have a tablet-based approach, you can get a whole lot smarter a whole lot quicker. Tablets come chock full of things that are all about education so the teachers can personalize the learning experience… A kid can get feedback about what skills she’s mastered and what skills she hasn’t… Tablets are in classrooms across the country now, and the excitement of the teachers and students is something to behold… I think that tablets are helping the teachers. This is a way for a teacher to prepare her lesson and share it with other teachers to get feedback. I think this is an initiative where we don’t need to butt heads and we can all join together, work together, and do what’s right for teachers and what’s right for kids.”

10	Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?	"""Far too many states use unreliable and insecure electronic voting machines, and many states have made their situation worse by adding some forms of Internet voting for some voters, which cannot be checked for accuracy at all. Even in states where verifiable systems are used, too often the check on the voting system's function and accuracy is not done. The voting equipment now in use are aging; resources are severely impacted by the state of the economy over the past several years; shortages of both equipment and human resources are likely. After all the effort necessary to overcome the other hurdles to casting a ballot, it is patently unfair that once you get to the ballot box, that the ballot itself fails you. Taken together, these problems threaten to silently disenfranchise voters, potentially in sufficient numbers to alter outcomes."""

01	Does Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) Apply to Felon Disenfranchisement Laws?	"""It is plain to anyone reading the Voting Rights Act that it applies to all 'voting qualification[s].' And it is equally plain that [New York Election Law] § 5-106 [which denies the vote to incarcerated felons and felons on parole] disqualifies a group of people from voting. These two propositions should constitute the entirety of our analysis. Section 2 of the Act by its unambiguous terms subjects felony disenfranchisement and all other voting qualifications to its coverage.   The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not to question its plain terms. I do not believe that Congress wishes us to disregard the plain language of any statute or to invent exceptions to the statutes it has created. The majority's 'wealth of persuasive evidence' that Congress intended felony disenfranchisement laws to be immune from scrutiny under § 2 of the Act, Maj. Op. at 25, includes not a single legislator actually saying so. But even if Congress had doubts about the wisdom of subjecting felony disenfranchisement laws to the results test of § 2, I trust that Congress would prefer to make any needed changes itself, rather than have courts do so for it.   I respectfully dissent."""
10	Is Expanding Nuclear Energy Production Necessary to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions?	"""[T]here is scant debate that climate change is one of the most pressing threats of our time, and it is imperative that we take swift and decisive action to avert its most severe impacts. However, the attempt by the nuclear industry to anoint nuclear power as the solution to climate change is dangerous and threatens to squander the resources necessary to implement meaningful climate change mitigation policies...  [N]ew reactors would have to come online every few weeks for the next fifty years to have even a modest impact on GHG emissions—new nuclear reactors cannot be built fast enough to address climate change...  The argument that we need nuclear power because it is the only environmentally viable alternative to coal is fallacious: alternatives exist and they are available right now...  There are numerous renewable energy technologies available which could be expanded and many more that have great potential and should be pursued and funded more aggressive...  Our choice is stark: we can effectively address the climate crisis or we can expand the nuclear industry. We can't do both."""
01	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry… Also, uniforms are more practical than regular clothes… Students who wear uniforms during the week do not need a lot of leisure clothes, which can lower clothing costs. It is also worth noting that uniforms do not have to be expensive, they can simply be particular pants and sweaters. If low-income families still cannot afford uniforms, there are many ways to help them. Districts, school parents, graduates as well as community and business leaders have worked together to donate or finance uniforms… Yet another benefit of uniforms is that they teach students to dress according to guidelines. Some believe that uniforms do not prepare students for the real world in which people wear whatever they want. However, most workplaces have uniforms or dress codes. Also, uniforms increase student safety. They prevent thefts because no one’s clothes are more valuable. Moreover, intruders can be easily sighted. It is easier for field-trip chaperones to know for which students they are responsible.”
10	Should Selling Sexual Acts Be Decriminalized but Buying Criminalized Such as in Sweden?	"""Nor should we turn to the Swedish model which prosecutes the men who pay for sex. The Swedish experience shows that all this does is drive prostitution underground. In the UK, laws criminalising the client have been tried for 17 years, and there is no sign whatsoever that prostitution is dying out, even though this is the main rationale for this type of law.   While on the Select Committee we heard evidence from a sex worker in Sweden who talked about the much greater physical dangers she and others now face as a result of the law change there. She reported that some of the worst consequences of the Swedish law have been that there is a lot more underage teenage prostitution, that the mafia bosses have more control, and that workers are too scared to get police help even when friends are murdered because if it gets out that they've called the cops, they lose all their customers.  I would like to ask those feminists and Christians in the House who are so fond of the Swedish model, whether they really think it preferable that we should impose greater criminalisation on the industry with all that that entails, rather than remove sanctions and create the protections which come when prostitutes feel able to call police and other services for help when they need it, without fear of persecution or of loss of trade."""
10	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""The First Amendment states 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.' As I understand it, this resulted from the Framers' awareness of the persecution and animosity that inevitably accompanies state religions. With this in mind, they made the decision to ensure religious freedom by keeping the government out of that sensitive area. Personally, I think this was a good idea. And even if I didn't, it's one of the fundamental rules of our society. Thus, when I see our Pledge of Allegiance containing the words 'under God,' I see a gross violation of one of our foremost Constitutional mandates."""
01	Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?	"""There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. It is unrealistic and inhumane to deport these individuals from their families and lives in the United States. These immigrants should be offered a path to legal status and eventually earned citizenship. This track to citizenship should be realistic, rather than being so burdensome that it prevents integration. Allowing these immigrants to regularize their status will not only strengthen our national security, but will also stimulate the economy and enhance America’s rich, vibrant, and diverse culture."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""Few would dispute the Palestinian entitlement to a state, but it simply cannot be achieved given the present reality. It was always folly to pursue the two-state solution in a context that militated against its ever happening. Today's Israel-Palestine is demonstrably one state, impossible to divide. But it is a discriminatory state operating an apartheid-style system against the Palestinians with impunity. Gross economic inequality is one indicator of this system.   This situation demands a new Palestinian strategy, a Plan B that converts the Palestinian struggle for two states into one for equal rights within what is now a unitary state ruled by Israel. The first step in this plan requires a dismantlement of the PA as currently constituted, or at least a change of direction for the Palestinian leadership…  The PA's new relationship with Israel should be restricted to pursuing the rights of its occupied people, including the right to political resistance. The PA should lead the campaign to prepare Palestinians for the abandonment of the two-state idea and the struggle for equal rights instead. Without a middleman to hide behind, the reality of Israel's occupation will be exposed, and the logic of a civil rights struggle will be inarguable."""

01	Is Vaping with E-Cigarettes Safe?	"Vaping is a safer way to ingest a tobacco product. A UK government report stated that ""best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes."" [16] Matthew Carpenter, Co-director of the Tobacco Research Program at the Hollings Cancer Center, said, ""Combustible cigarettes are the most harmful form of nicotine delivery."" [17] E-cigarettes are safer for indoor use. Researchers found that the level of nicotine on surfaces in the homes of e-cigarette users was nearly 200 times lower than in the homes of traditional cigarette smokers. [1] Nicotine left behind on surfaces can turn into carcinogens; the amount of nicotine found where vapers live was similar to the trace amounts in the homes of nonsmokers. [18] Vaping has likely contributed to record low levels of youth smoking, which hit a record-low of just 7.6 percent of high school students in 2017, down from 19.8 percent in 2006 (the year e-cigarettes were introduced in the United States). [19][20] A report from Public Health England found no evidence that vaping is an entry into smoking for young people. [21]"

10	"Should the Words ""under God"" Be in the US Pledge of Allegiance?"	"""As a matter of common sense, the court's ruling is both sensible and obvious. 'Under God' is intrusive and unnecessary in a pledge of patriotism; we're not speaking as believers; we are speaking as citizens."""
01	"Does the Phrase ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause?"	"""As the 9th Circuit recognized, there is a strong argument that the Pledge violates the Establishment Clause under the endorsement test as well as Lemon. This is true, not in spite of, but rather because of, the Pledge's primarily patriotic intent. As an affirmation of citizenship, the Pledge defines membership in the political community. As amended in 1954, the Pledge refers to a particular belief, monotheism, that many people—not only atheists, but members of religions such as Buddhism—do not share. This official reference to a single God may well strike nonbelievers as an act of exclusion...  In adding 'under God' to the Pledge of Allegiance, Congress was unquestionably motivated by a religious purpose. To dismiss the phrase as trivial or ceremonial overlooks the special compulsive influences that exist in the context of public schools, which tend to induce schoolchildren to recite the Pledge, thus meaningfully endangering their religious liberty.""

10	Is Parallel Testing an Effective Method of Assuring the Accuracy of Electronic Voting Machines?	"""Neither logic and accuracy nor parallel monitoring are sufficient to detect all types of malfunctions or tampering, nor do they provide a means of recovery in the case where a malfunction or tampering is discovered. For example, parallel monitoring on election day would not have discovered the type of DRE voting system malfunction as occurred in Carteret County, North Carolina in the November 2004 election. In that incident, over 4,000 valid votes were irretrievably lost by a DRE voting system...  Furthermore, parallel monitoring is typically conducted on only a small number of machines (usually representing much less than 1% of the machines deployed in each county) and a small number of DRE counties. It does not provide the same level of statistical sampling as provided by the 1% mandatory audit."""
10	Does Ethanol Generate More Energy Than the Amount Needed to Produce It?	"""Ethanol cannot be produced from corn without wasting huge amounts of petroleum. Petroleum is needed to fuel farm machinery, to produce fertilizer and insecticide, and to transport the corn and ethanol by diesel truck or train...  Ethanol already gets an indefensible tax break at the pump of 51 to 71 cents a gallon, but Congress now wants to compel everyone to add it to their tanks. But doing so would leave us with less fuel at higher prices. Why? Because there is much less energy in eight gallons of ethanol than in the seven gallons of gasoline it takes to produce it."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“The opposition to gaming springs largely from the neophobia that has pitted the old against the entertainments of the young for centuries. Most gamers are under 40, and most critics are non-games-playing over-40s. But what of the specific complaints – that games foster addiction and encourage violence? There’s no good evidence for either… Most of the research on whether video games encourage violence is unsatisfactory, focusing primarily on short-term effects. In the best study so far, frequent playing of a violent game sustained over a month had no effect on participants’ level of aggression. And, during the period in which gaming has become widespread in America, violent crime has fallen by half. If games really did make people violent, this tendency might be expected to show up in the figures, given that half of Americans play computer and video games. Perhaps, as some observers have suggested, gaming actually makes people less violent, by acting as a safety valve.”
01	Is Drinking Milk a Good Way to Build Strong Bones?	"""A myth which often re-surfaces in media reports is that milk may not be beneficial to bone health. Bone health experts are concerned that this may be causing confusion among the general public and causing many people to avoid milk and dairy foods unnecessarily – when in fact they are among the best sources of bone-healthy nutrients...   - Dairy products, including milk, are an excellent source of calcium, phosphorus, protein and other nutrients that are important both for bone and overall health...   - Evidence strongly supports the benefits of dairy products for bone and muscle health. Studies have shown that bone loss is reduced and there is an improvement in muscle mass and strength with adequate dairy intake.   - Milk and other dairy foods are the most readily available sources of calcium... It is important to note that people would need to eat numerous servings of kale or broccoli or other non-dairy foods to get the equivalent amount of calcium provided by just one serving of yoghurt, cheese, or milk."""
10	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“One argument for lowering the Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) from 21 is that 19-and 20-year-olds are drinking anyway, so why not legalize it so they will drink in controlled settings. Research shows, however, that about half of drivers arrested or killed while driving intoxicated (DWI) had been drinking at licensed establishments. Another argument for lowering the MLDA is that keeping it at 21 only increases the desire for the ‘forbidden fruit,’ such that when teens turn 21, they will drink heavily. Research shows, however, that when the drinking age is 21, those younger than 21 drink less and continue to drink less through their early 20s. A third argument is that the Federal MLDA exerts too much authority over the States. The response to this argument is that providing for the public’s safety is the primary responsibility of government at all levels… This policy paper argues that national and international evidence shows that lowering the drinking age results in increased traffic crashes and that lowering the drinking age in combination with alcohol education programs does not impact the drinking and driving habits of youth under 21 years old. In arguing for a continuance of a MLDA of 21, this paper points to a 59-percent reduction in the rate of young alcohol-impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes between 1982 and 1998.”
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""It's time for legislators to wake up from slumber land by legalizing and regulating prostitution...   Some folks disapprove of the immoral nature of sex for sale and, perhaps, rightfully so. But judging morality is for churches, employers, family members and peers. It should not be a matter for law enforcement, court dockets and jail cells, costing the taxpayer dearly, every day, every month, every year...  Prostitution flourishes in the black market that would not exist if brothels and hookers were legitimized, licensed, medically inspected, zoned and taxed. Like drugs, gambling and other crimes of morality, or alcohol prohibition of years past, the black market is nourished by draconian laws that forever fail to accomplish its intended purpose...  In Germany, and other countries, prostitution is legal and taxed. They turn the 'crime' into an economic plus. In other countries like the United States, we create the 'crime,' which turns the behavior into an economic negative. And, it's still a thriving business, law or no law."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“God has willed to give the union of man and woman a special participation in his work of creation. Thus, he blessed the man and the woman with the words ‘Be fruitful and multiply’ (Gen 1:28). Therefore, in the Creator’s plan, sexual complementarity and fruitfulness belong to the very nature of marriage. Furthermore, the marital union of man and woman has been elevated by Christ to the dignity of a sacrament. The Church teaches that Christian marriage is an efficacious sign of the covenant between Christ and the Church (cf. Eph 5:32). This Christian meaning of marriage, far from diminishing the profoundly human value of the marital union between man and woman, confirms and strengthens it (cf. Mt 19:3-12; Mk 10:6-9)… There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family. Marriage is holy, while homosexual acts go against the natural moral law. Homosexual acts ‘close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.’ Sacred Scripture condemns homosexual acts ‘as a serious depravity…'”
01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“[T]he American Bar Association urges state, territorial, and tribal governments to eliminate all of their legal barriers to civil marriage between two persons of the same sex who are otherwise eligible to marry. Many gay and lesbian people seek a committed, lifelong partnership with another adult, and to raise children. ABA policy has kept pace with our society’s evolving understanding that gay and lesbian people are healthy, functioning contributors to our society who face discrimination – both as individuals and as families… This proposed recommendation will signal the ABA’s support for the extension of equal marriage rights to same-sex couples under state, territorial, and tribal law, as consistent with our country’s constitutional principles of equal protection and due process, as well as states’ strong interest in protecting and fostering the family unit… In addition, the denial of these important protections harms the hundreds of thousands of children being raised by same-sex couples. Treating same-sex couples differently not only tangibly harms those individuals, couples, and their families, but also stigmatizes them and their children by deeming them unworthy to enjoy fundamental and equal citizenship rights.”
01	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""[C]apital punishment may be morally required not for retributive reasons, but in order to prevent the taking of innocent lives...   The foundation for our argument is a large and growing body of evidence that capital punishment may well have a deterrent effect, possibly a quite powerful one. A leading study [The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a 'Judicial Experiment,' Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd, July 2003] suggests that each execution prevents some eighteen murders, on average... If the current evidence is even roughly correct, then a refusal to impose capital punishment will effectively condemn numerous innocent people to death...   Contrary to widely-held beliefs, based on partial information or older studies, a wave of recent evidence suggests the possibility that capital punishment saves lives...   Capital punishment may well have strong deterrent effects; there is evidence that few categories of murders are inherently un-deterrable, even so-called crimes of passion; some studies find extremely large deterrent effects; error and arbitrariness undoubtedly occur, but the evidence of deterrence suggests that prospective murderers are receiving a clear signal."""

10	Should Electronic Voting Machines Have Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails?	"""It is alleged that adding a so-called 'voter-verified paper trail' to a DRE machine will either permit tampering to be detected or at the very least will provide a reliable record of how each voter voted that can be used for a recount, even if the recount must be done by hand. This is incorrect... The [voter-verified] paper trail provides no assurance at all that her vote will ever be counted or will be counted correctly. The reason simply is that the paper trail itself become insecure at the moment of its creation.  First, if the machine cannot be trusted, which is the working hypothesis of paper trail proponents, then it cannot be trusted to deal with the paper trail safely. After the voter leaves the voting booth, it can mark her ballot as void and print a different one. The voter will have left the booth believing not only that her vote was cast and counted properly, but that will also be counted properly in any recount. None of these beliefs is correct.  One might argue that the inspection and testing of the machine would reveal such abjectly bad behavior, but the claim of DRE opponents is that no amount of inspection and testing is ever sufficient. If testing is adequate to reveal paper flaws, then it is adequate to uncover other faults in the machines."""

Moreover, global production will eventually follow an undulating plateau for one or more decades before declining slowly. Global resources, including both conventional and unconventional oils, are adequate to support strong production growth and a period on an undulating plateau.  - Despite his valuable contribution, M. King Hubbert's methodology falls down because it does not consider likely resource growth, application of new technology, basic commercial factors, or the impact of geopolitics on production. His approach does not work in all cases-including on the United States itself-and cannot reliably model a global production outlook. Put more simply, the case for the imminent peak is flawed. As it is, production in 2005 in the Lower 48 in the United States was 66 percent higher than Hubbert projected.  - The debate should now move toward a better understanding of the key drivers of production, including the scale of global resources and the likely production outlook, which form the core of current disagreements and confusion."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Behind the facade of a regulated industry, brothel prostitutes in Nevada are captive in conditions analogous to slavery. Women often are procured for the brothels from other areas by pimps who dump them at the house in order to collect the referral fee. Women report working in shifts commonly as long as 12 hours, even when ill, menstruating or pregnant, with no right to refuse a customer who has requested them or to refuse the sexual act for which he has paid. The dozen or so prostitutes I interviewed said they are expected to pay the brothel room and board and a percentage of their earnings -- sometimes up to 50 percent. They also must pay for mandatory extras such as medical exams, assigned clothing and fines incurred for breaking house rules. And, contrary to the common claim that the brothel will protect women from the dangerous, crazy clients on the streets, rapes and assaults by customers are covered up by the management."""
01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	"Drone pilots have a lower risk for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than pilots of manned aircraft and other battlefield soldiers. Drone pilots suffer less than traditional pilots because they do not have to be directly present on the battlefield, can live a normal civilian life in the United States, and do not risk death or serious injury. Only 4% of active-duty drone pilots are at ""high risk for PTSD"" compared to the 12-17% of soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. [46] Read More"
10	Should the US have attacked Iraq?	"""In the final analysis, the war against Iraq was the wrong war. Not because the United States used preemptive military force—preemptive self-defense would have been justified in the face of a truly imminent threat. Not because the United States acted without the consent of the United Nations—no country should surrender its defense to a vote of other nations. And not because Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMD)—none has been discovered and, even if they existed, they were not a threat. The war against Iraq was the wrong war because the enemy at the gates was, and continues to be, Al Qaeda. Not only was Iraq not a direct military threat to the United States (even if it possessed WMD, which was a fair assumption), but there is no good evidence to support the claim that Saddam Hussein was in league with Al Qaeda and would have given the group WMD to be used against the United States.""

10	Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?	"""Cow's milk has become a point of controversy among doctors and nutritionists. There was a time when it was considered very desirable, but research has forced us to rethink this recommendation... Dairy products contribute to a surprising number of health problems. They can impair a child's ability to absorb iron and in very small children can even cause subtle blood loss from the digestive tract. Combined with the fact that milk has virtually no iron of its own, the result is an increased risk of iron deficiency...  Cow's milk proteins are a common cause of colic, and now the American Academy of Pediatrics has concluded that there is evidence that cow's milk may well contribute to childhood-onset diabetes.

If vaccines were not tested on animals, millions of animals would have died from rabies, distemper, feline leukemia, infectious hepatitis virus, tetanus, anthrax, and canine parvo virus. Treatments for animals developed using animal testing also include pacemakers for heart disease and remedies for glaucoma and hip dysplasia. [9][21] Animal testing has also been instrumental in saving endangered species from extinction, including the black-footed ferret, the California condor and the tamarins of Brazil.

Known as 'synchronous menstruation,' this phenomenon can stir up campus anxiety from college dorms to sorority houses and even the classroom. But thanks to recent research, a glass of good old fashioned milk can help off-set the symptoms of PMS...  By conservative estimates, one in every two menstruating women suffers from moderate to severe PMS each month. According to St. Luke-Roosevelt Hospital researchers at Columbia University, calcium - naturally occurring in milk - cuts the physical and emotional symptoms of PMS in half. They found that women on high-calcium diets were less irritable, weepy, and depressed. Plus, they averted backaches, cramping and bloating - symptoms that can make any woman feel less than royal!"""
01	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“What exams test reflects what states want their students to learn — the standards. Comparing average scores between schools and districts is possible only because the same test is done. In measuring what students know, tests are a tremendous asset, providing important and reliable information that cannot be learned in other ways… To parents who are not educators, the process of creating standardized tests might seem like a big black box. In fact, it’s a rigorous and highly scientific process, one that has been developed over 100 years and reflects research by generations of esteemed scholars. It has its own subfield, psychometrics, and every year universities graduate new Ph.D.s in that subfield.”

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“Forty years ago [in 1971] President Richard Nixon severed the final link between the dollar and gold. We have been living with the consequences of that colossal error ever since… Since 1971 real economic expansion has averaged 2.9% a year – more than a full percentage point slower than the 4% growth rate during the post-World War II gold-standard period. When compounded over 40 years, 1% slower growth under the paper dollar system has had a mind-boggling impact on our incomes and the size of the economy. At 3% growth the U.S. economy is about $8 trillion smaller than it would have been had we continued to experience the average growth rate prior to Nixon severing the link between the dollar and gold. That implies that median family income today would be about $70,000, or nearly 50% higher than it is today. The dollar we use today is worth less than two dimes in buying power compared with the pre-Nixon dollar. And with little reason to believe that the dollar will maintain even this paltry value, the average American family is left with no meaningful way to save for its children’s education or its own retirement… We have paid dearly for Nixon’s colossal error. But this abhorrent deviation from a sound dollar can be corrected. The country – and the world – awaits the political leader who truly understands that making the dollar as good as gold is vital to the prosperity, security and liberty of the American people, and who can therefore lead the country and the world forward to a 21st-century gold standard.”

"""[T]he use of rbST in milk production has been shown to elevate the levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a naturally-occurring hormone that in high levels is linked to several types of cancers, among other things. The amici [Center for Food Safety] also point to certain studies indicating that rbST use induces an unnatural period of milk production during a cow's 'negative energy phase.' According to these studies, milk produced during this stage is considered to be low quality due to its increased fat content and its decreased level of proteins. The amici further note that milk from treated cows contains higher somatic cell counts, which makes the milk turn sour more quickly and is another indicator of poor milk quality. This evidence precludes us from agreeing with the district court's conclusion that there is no compositional difference between the two types of milk."""

10	Does Buddhism Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	Buddhism allow homosexuality? The answer is, no it does not… The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path:… Nowhere in Buddah’s teachings or sayings does he fully define what an ‘unlawful sexual act’ is. So all we can get from this is that there are some sexual acts that are unlawful–and thus should not be engaged in. The question is then, are homosexual acts unlawful?… The Second Step on the Eightfold Path is Right Resolve: ‘You must renounce the pleasures of the senses; you must harbor no ill will toward anyone and harm no living creature.’ Homosexual behavior violates two of the three things listed here, thus homosexual behavior must be a unlawful sexual act. Homosexual behavior is a pleasure of the senses. This is demonstrated by the typical behavior (as documented in scientific studies) of homosexuals showing that even homosexuals in committed relationships have numerous ‘one night stands’ on a regular basis… But the biggest problem is that homosexual acts harm (seriously harm) other people–this is directly in opposition to Buddhism. There is a huge list of health problems associated with homosexual acts, both physical and mental. Just a few are: Human Papillomavirus (HPV); Hepatitis; rectal and throat Gonorrhea; Gay Bowel Syndrome (GBS); HIV/AIDS; Anal Cancer; and more… The evidence is overwhelming. Homosexual acts are the cause of serious physical and mental health problems. Thus they violate the Buddhist teaching to harm no living creature.”
01	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""[T]he prospects for a two-state solution are receding. Secretary of State Kerry's sterling efforts have produced regrettably few results, perhaps because he addressed only part of the problem. But the international community cannot give up. Credible polls show that the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians still want a two-state solution. The only alternatives are the status quo or a binational state of some kind. Both are a dead end. The status quo means drift, more settlements, Gaza imprisoned and isolated with more extremism, and Israel retreating to another Masada fortress… There is no secure future in the status quo for Israelis or Palestinians.  As to the binational state or one-state solution, Kerry's withdrawn public reference to apartheid was in fact right. The population trends show that there are at present 6 million Israeli Jews, with a similar and rapidly growing population of Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. If this is to be a Jewish nation, it would, in all likelihood, lead to an apartheid nation of Bantustans, where democracy would be undermined by the treatment of Palestinians as second-class citizens. Israel would be at serious risk of no longer providing a permanent home for the Jews, but of destroying itself through civil strife and international condemnation…  [G]iven leadership and determination, Israelis and Palestinians can still reach a two-state solution and that the dangers for all parties in the alternatives still outweigh the challenges of reaching a peace settlement."""

To be sure, a total prohibition against assisted suicide does close an 'avenue of escape,' but, unlike a refusal to honor a competent patient's request to terminate life-sustaining treatment, it does not force one into 'a particular, all-consuming, totally dependent and indeed rigidly standardized life: the life of one confined to a hospital bed, attached to medical machinery, and tended to by medical professionals.'"""

In other cases, teachers convicted of heinous crimes receive generous payoffs to go away because school districts know that there is slim hope of dismissing them. California law makes such firings virtually impossible. The system is so irrational that it compels administrators to bestow ‘permanent employment’ – lifetime tenure – on individuals before they even finish their new-teacher training program or receive teaching credentials. As a result of this nonsensical regime, certain students get stuck with utterly incompetent or indifferent teachers, resulting in serious harm from which the students may never recover. Such arbitrary, counterproductive rules would never be tolerated in any other business. They should especially not be tolerated where children’s futures are at stake. There are many problems facing our education system, and there is no silver bullet that can fix them all at once. But there is no better place to begin than by removing senseless laws that devalue effective, inspiring teachers and hurt students.”
10	Should Baseball Players Who Have Used Banned Substances Be Voted into the Hall of Fame?	"""It doesn't matter whether the player's production, either home runs or hits, was drug enhanced once, twice or ten times. It doesn't matter; it's still cheating and impugning the integrity of the game and the player's accomplishments... Those great players currently enshrined in the Hall of Fame achieved that honor strictly on the merits of their god-given talents and not by utilizing artificial means to enhance their accomplishments.  The game has been tarnished by steroid charges, and the issue of enshrinement in baseball's Hall of Fame of players who have used steroids, regardless of their career statistics, is a critical issue that may well impact the standards and integrity of the Hall of Fame itself."""
01	Will Alternative Energy Development Increase US Energy Independence and Security?	"""The legislation I am signing today [Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, HR 6] will address our vulnerabilities and our dependence in two important ways. First, it will increase the supply of alternative fuel sources. I proposed an alternative fuel standard earlier this year. This standard would require fuel producers to include a certain amount of alternative fuels in their products. This standard would create new markets for foreign products used to produce these fuels. This standard would increase our energy security by making us less vulnerable to instability--to the instability of oil prices on the world market.  The bill I sign today takes a significant step because it will require fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022. This is nearly a fivefold increase over current levels. It will help us diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on oil."""
01	Can Marijuana Use Cause Death?	cardiovascular changes [from marijuana use] have not posed a health problem for healthy, young users of marijuana or THC. However, such changes in heart rate and blood pressure could present a serious problem for older patients, especially those with coronary arterial or cerebrovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in the United States (coronary heart disease is first; stroke is third), so any effect of marijuana use on cardiovascular disease could have a substantial impact on public health. The magnitude of the impact remains to be determined as chronic marijuana users from the late 1960s enter the age when coronary arterial and cerebrovascular diseases become common. Smoking marijuana is also known to decrease maximal exercise performance. That, with the increased heart rate, could theoretically induce angina, so, this raises the possibility that patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease should be advised not to smoke marijuana, and THC might be contraindicated in patients with restricted cardiovascular function.”
10	Dakota Access Pipeline: Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The Dakota Access Pipeline will worsen climate change by pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of shale oil to market daily. If completed, the DAPL would carry 470,000 - 570,000 barrels of Bakken shale oil to market. [2] The extracted oil, once processed, transported, and burned, would release 101.4 million metric tons of CO2 each year. This is the equivalent of the emissions from 29.5 coal plants or 21.4 million cars per year. [21] A peer-reviewed study found that a global rise in atmospheric ethane, a greenhouse gas, can be traced largely to hydraulic fracking in the North Dakota Bakken shale oil fields. [20] According to US Senator Bernie Sanders, ""if we have any hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, we should not be building new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for generations to come.""

10	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""We must put a price, a rising price, on carbon emissions.  There are two competing ways to achieve that price:  One is Tax & 100% Dividend – tax carbon emissions, but give all of the money back to the public on a per capita basis...  The alternative to carbon tax and 100% dividend is Tax & Trade, foisted on the public under the pseudonym 'Cap & Trade'...  'Cap & Trade' increases costs to the public as does 'Tax & Dividend', but without the dividend. Thus it should be termed 'Tax & Trade'... parties support 'Cap & Trade' because they hope to profit – it is a give-away to special interests, who feel, based on extensive empirical evidence, that they will be able to manipulate the program through their lobbyists...  The worst thing about cap-and-trade, from a climate standpoint, is that it will surely be inadequate to achieve the sharp reduction of emissions that is needed. Thus cap-and-trade would practically guarantee disastrous climate change for our children and grandchildren...  The greatest injustice is to our own species – our children, grandchildren and the unborn, and people who live with nature, who we may call 'undeveloped', indigenous people who want only to live their lives without bearing burdens that we create...  The honest approach, the effective approach, for solving the global warming problem would be a tax with 100% dividend...  Empirical evidence shows that Cap & Trade does not have a prayer of phasing out fossil fuel emissions fast enough to save the planet."""

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""So is the solar revolution finally here? Not quite. Even after a decade of rampant growth solar energy still barely moves the needle in the U.S. energy mix. In fact, solar merely equals the amount of electricity that the nation generates by burning natural gas captured from landfills…  The biggest sources are the old standbys. Oil still reigns supreme at 36 quadrillion Btu, natural gas at 26 quads, nuclear 8. Hydropower and biomass bring up the rear at 2.6 and 2.7 quads. Wind is just 1.5 quads. And coal — the great carbon-belching demon of the global energy mix — its contribution is 19 quads. That’s nearly 8 times all the nation's wind and solar generation combined…  For all the talk of 'grid parity' the simple reality is that even combined with far more power generation from natural gas, renewable alternatives will need decades to push out coal. And the irony will be that as demand for coal lessens, it will become cheaper and cheaper, making it even more attractive for the coal-burning power plants that survive the coming cull…  Coal has gotten immensely cleaner over the past generation. And new and better ways will be found to extract energy from coal without sending its dangerous byproducts into the environment. It's scalable and reliable in ways that renewable energy sources simply aren't. In short, unless we’re willing to put up with blackouts that freeze grandma in the winter and melt her in the summer, coal will remain a mainstay of U.S. power generation for decades to come."""

His leadership in these achievements strengthened peace and expanded freedom. This is a president whose deliberate policies produced seven years of economic growth…after Democratic economists said that was impossible.”
10	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""The bill [PPACA] in fact contains substantial benefits (some might even say giveaways) for small businesses. That starts with a program already under way to offer special subsidies to firms with fewer than 25 employees that want to offer health benefits. As long as your employees earn less than $50,000 on average... you can get a tax credit to defray 35 percent of the cost of the insurance if you're a for-profit firm, and 25 percent if you're a nonprofit. When the law really gets rolling in 2014, those subsidies rise to 50 percent for for-profits and 35 percent for nonprofits...  Firms with fewer than 50 employees are also exempt from the 'employer responsibility' provision of the law that otherwise constitutes the biggest business burden in the legislation...

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""The ACLU supports the decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of prostitution. The ACLU also condemns the abuse of vagrancy or loitering laws or licensing or regulatory schemes to harass and arrest those who may be engaged in solicitation for prostitution. While there are both male and female prostitutes, laws against prostitution most frequently refer to, or are applied to woman. Despite the statutory stress on female prostitution, the ACLU's policy is applicable to prostitutes of both sexes...   Such laws have traditionally represented one of the most direct forms of discrimination against women. The woman who engage in prostitution is punished criminally and stigmatized socially while her male customer, either by the explicit design of the statute or through a pattern of discriminatory enforcement is left unscathed.  Prostitution laws are also a violation of the right of individual privacy because they impose penal sanctions for the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. Whether a person chooses to engage in sexual activity for purposes of recreation, or in exchange for something of value, is a matter of individual choice, not for governmental interference. Police use of entrapment techniques to enforce laws against this essentially private activity is reprehensible. Similarly, the use of loitering and vagrancy laws to punish prostitutes for their status or to make arrests on the basis of reputation and appearance, is contrary to civilized notions of due process of law.   Since the ACLU policy is that prostitution should not be made criminal, solicitation for prostitution is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  The ACLU reaffirms its policy favoring removal of criminal penalties for prostitution and in support of total sexual freedom among consenting adults in private."""

01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Simulating violence such as shooting guns and hand-to-hand combat in video games can cause real-life violent behavior. Video games often require players to simulate violent actions, such as stabbing, shooting, or dismembering someone with an ax, sword, chainsaw, or other weapons.

[23] A 2015 peer-reviewed study found ""compelling evidence that the use of realistic controllers can have a significant effect on the level of cognitive aggression."" [118] Two teenagers in Tennessee who shot at passing cars and killed one driver told police they got the idea from playing Grand Theft Auto III. [49] Bruce Bartholow, professor of psychology at the University of Missouri, spoke about the effects of simulating violence: ""More than any other media, these [violent] video games encourage active participation in violence.

In insider trading, the connection is direct, and the profit is sure.  But with legislation, the link between advanced knowledge of a senator's position on an issue and the certainty that a specific stock will benefit as a result is much more tenuous...

10	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“The question before us now is whether marijuana should be fully legal and widely available for commercial sale. We think the answer is ‘no’… In the year after the drug was legalized in Colorado, marijuana-related emergency room visits increased nearly 30 percent, as did traffic deaths involving marijuana. Edible marijuana products – often in the form of brownies, candy, or soda – pose a particular threat for children, who may mistake them for regular treats. According to data from the National Poison Data System, marijuana exposure has been on the rise among children under six, particularly in states where the drug is legal. High potency edible products also pose a risk to adults, who can easily consume more marijuana than intended and experience serious adverse effects. The financial backers of legalization are not neighborhood leaders, medical professionals, or grass-roots activists. They’re big businesses and investors, who are spending millions on campaigns across the country because they will profit from the legalization of marijuana… Decades of research have now debunked the myth that marijuana is harmless. The science also shows that regular marijuana users – especially those who start at a young age – are more likely to try more dangerous drugs… Our emergency departments and drug treatment centers are beyond capacity, and our first responders are stretched to their limits. We should not be expanding access to a drug that will further drain our health and safety resources.”

01	"Does the Phrase ""under God"" in the Pledge of Allegiance Violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause?"	"""[T]here is in the Establishment Clause a clear textual basis for a right of atheists and nontheists to be free from government endorsement and coercion. That right is reinforced by the Free Exercise Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. Together, these provisions ensure the rights of religious groups to exercise their beliefs and to be treated equally...  [T]he legislative history of the 1954 amendment to the Pledge indicates that the Pledge was decidedly not intended to be neutral with respect to religion. It takes sides on a controversial question: whether God exists and whether the nation is dependent on God. The federal law sends a message to nontheists that they are disfavored and outside the political community, while assuring theists that they are preferred. The recitation of the Pledge in schools amplifies this effect...  'Under God' may be only two words, but they reflect a pervasive pattern of government behavior that suppresses the development of atheistic and nontheistic beliefs.

[34] The US General Accountability Office (GAO) estimated that 31% of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns: 100% of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills him/herself or another child could be prevented by automatic child-proof safety locks; and 23% of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. [35] Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, ""We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves… [B]ecause children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot 'gun-proof' them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.""

01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“As to direct-to-to-consumer advertising, first of all, I’d like to put things in perspective. I think there has been a criticism of the industry that we are spending more on DTC than we do on the rest of marketing, or more importantly, on R&D. In fact, in 2001, the total expenses for direct-to-consumer advertising was $2.4 billion for the whole industry, versus $30 billion on R&D. I think direct-to-consumer advertising has some very important public health benefits. One is, you can see for the majority of the products which are advertised, that they deal with conditions which, according to medical experts and the data available, are under-treated — diseases such as depression, such as diabetes, such as hypertension, such as high cholesterol. All of these areas are today under-treated, and direct-to-consumer advertising helps educate patients and bring them to the doctor’s office. The most expensive disease is the one which is not diagnosed or treated. The other benefit of direct-to-consumer advertising, from a public health standpoint, is that, according to surveys of both physicians and patients, one out of five, approximately, says that to see the advertisement helps that patient remember to take his or her medication. Non-compliance is a very, very serious issue.”
10	Has Obamacare Improved Medicaid? - DEBATED	"""According to a recent study, perhaps up to 80% of ObamaCare's new Medicaid enrollees previously had private insurance plans.   These people are being shunted into a health care program that is substandard to private market alternatives.   Fewer physicians are accepting new Medicaid patients than ever.   Five years ago, 55% of physicians reported accepting new Medicaid patients; today, that number has dropped to 45%...  As illustrated above, this lack of doctors leads to increased wait times for medical care, which ultimately leads to worse health outcomes for these patients.   One recent study found that Medicaid is not only worse than private insurance — it can be worse than having no insurance at all. Medicaid patients were 25% likelier to have an in-hospital death than those completely without health insurance.   The same study also found that, compared with private insurance, Medicaid patients were twice as likely to have an in-hospital death, had the longest lengths of hospital stays and had the highest costs.   Other studies have reached similar conclusions. Two studies from the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University found that Medicaid patients have higher mortality rates and higher death rates than patients with private health insurance.   These are startling results for a government-run health care system advertised as a quality substitute for private insurance. In reality, ObamaCare has created a two-tier health care system — and it's forcing millions of patients out of the top tier and into the bottom."""

[6] On both standardized tests and grades, students in classes that were assigned homework outperformed 69% of students who didn't have homework. [7] A majority of studies on homework's impact - 64% in one meta-study and 72% in another - showed that take home assignments were effective at improving academic achievement. [7][8] Research by the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) concluded that increased homework led to better GPAs and higher probability of college attendance for high school boys. In fact, boys who attended college did more than three hours of additional homework per week in high school. [10]"
01	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	"The concept of “traditional marriage” has changed over time, and the definition of marriage as always being between one man and one woman is historically inaccurate. Harvard University historian Nancy F. Cott stated that until two centuries ago, ""monogamous households were a tiny, tiny portion"" of the world's population, and were found only in ""Western Europe and little settlements in North America."" Polygamy has been widespread throughout history, according to Brown University political scientist Rose McDermott, PhD. [110] [106] Interracial marriage was once illegal in a majority of US states, and was still banned in half of US states until the 1950s. [108] Official unions between same-sex couples, indistinguishable from marriages except for gender, are believed by some scholars to have been common until the 13th Century in many countries, with the ceremonies performed in churches and the union sealed with a kiss between the two parties.

01	Does Marijuana Use Significantly Impair Driving Ability Even When Not under the Immediate Effects of the Drug?	that can help reduce the symptoms of a disease can also affect a person’s ability to drive safely. That is why some prescription drugs come with warnings not to drive for a certain amount of time after taking them. Cannabis impairs driving skills most severely during what is known as the acute phase, which typically lasts for up to 60 minutes after smoking. That is followed by post-acute (the phase after the acute one) and residual phases. The residual phase is 150 minutes or more after smoking [marijuana], during which impairment subsides rapidly. The degree of impairment during the residual phase depends on the amount of THC consumed. After smoking a so-called typical dose (about 20 mg) of THC, the residual phase lasts 2-3 hours.”
01	Should the Use of Performance Enhancing Drugs in Sports Be Legalized?	"""As we've seen with government bans on consensual activity - from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution - prohibitions not only don't work, they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground...  Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology. If something can be said to be 'natural', we tend to be okay with it. If it seems lab-made or synthetic we tend to be leery. But even synthetic drugs and manmade technology seem to be okay if the aim is to make sick or broken people whole again...  It's also important to note that we consider perfectly natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not so long ago. 100 years ago, life expectancy in the U.S. was 50 years of age. Today it's 78. Thanks to technology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals we are today taller, stronger, faster, healthier, and can expect to live longer than ever before...  Sports is about exploring and stretching the limits of human potential. Going back even to the pre-modern Olympics, when athletes ate live bees and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition, sports has never been some wholesome display of physical ability alone. Ingenuity, innovation, and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger (and avoiding what might do more harm than good) has always been a part of the game...

The Palestinians have rejected it each time. The U.S. and Europe have responded each time by providing more economic aid to the Palestinians and pressuring Israel to make more concessions. That hasn't worked...  Israel should continue to build and expand, and annex all the existing West Bank territories into Israel proper. Israeli citizenship, with all the rights and privileges it entails, should be offered to all its inhabitants. This is not a crazy idea, but a simple recipe that worked in Israel proper for generations and has produced too many Jewish and Arab success stories to count...

01	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""Hydrogen provides a promising method to help the U.S. achieve energy independence, make strides in environmental stewardship, and develop a thriving economy. Hydrogen produced through renewable energy sources, most commonly with a device which uses electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen called an electrolyzer, is an emissions-free way to carry energy...  Hydrogen provides the connecting point between renewable electricity production and transportation, stationary and portable energy needs. When the electricity from solar photovoltaics, wind, geothermal, ocean and hydro technologies is used to produce and store hydrogen, the renewable source becomes more valuable and can meet a variety of needs. In transportation applications, hydrogen provides a way to convert renewable resources to fuel for vehicles. Renewably produced hydrogen for transportation fuel is one of the most popular hydrogen economy goals, as it can be domestically produced and emissions free. Renewables often produce power intermittently (e.g., only when the sun is out or the wind is blowing), so hydrogen can also increase stationary power reliability when used as an electricity storage medium. Hydrogen, renewably produced during off-peak periods and stored, can provide constant power using fuel cells or engines when the renewable source isn't available...  There are few other options today for electricity storage at a large scale. Batteries are not practical and too costly, and pumped water systems and compressed air energy storage systems are only implementable in limited geographical areas...  [T]he future conjunction of hydrogen and renewable energy technology is a promising one."""
01	Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED	"""The problem stems from Obamacare's mandate that insurance companies can't consider an individual's health when establishing plan prices. While well-intentioned, this has the unintended side effect of spiking premiums across the board, especially for the young and the healthy.  These higher costs will affect small businesses in any number of ways. After all, they have to find the money to pay the new expenses that Obamacare forces on them. The most obvious decision will be to cut back employee hours. Others might ask their employees to pay a greater percentage of their premiums (which means less take home pay). And some will stop providing health care altogether...  America's job creators have never been so burdened. Small businesses create two out of every three new jobs. They employ half of the country's workforce. These businesses are the key to America's economic well-being; they shouldn't be buried in rising costs and reams of red tape.  But thanks to Obamacare, they can either pay even more for their health plans, or they can drop them altogether.

"""Across all counties in the U.S., the gain in the Republican share of the two-party vote between 2000 and 2004 was larger in counties that used touch-screen voting in 2004 than in other counties. The gain was 3.2 percentage points (standard error = 0.2) in DRE counties versus 1.8 percentage points (standard error = 0.7) in non-DRE counties. This implies a 'DRE effect' equal to 1.4 percentage points, large enough to affect the final outcome of the election...  [This finding] is consistent with concerns raised by some Democrats that the adoption of touch-screen voting helps Republicans. This interpretation is particularly troublesome because the magnitude of the estimated coefficient is large enough to have influenced the final result in several swing states, potentially altering the final outcome of the election."""

10	Has Legalizing Medical Marijuana Led to Increased Drug Abuse among Children and Adolescents?	years after the passage of the nation’s first state medical marijuana law, California’s Prop. 215, a considerable body of data shows that no state with a medical marijuana law has experienced an increase in youth marijuana use since their law’s enactment. All have reported overall decreases of more than the national average decreases — exceeding 50% in some age groups — strongly suggesting that enactment of state medical marijuana laws does not increase teen marijuana use…. When states consider proposals to allow the medical use of marijuana under state law, the concern often arises that such laws might ‘send the wrong message’ and therefore cause an increase in marijuana use among young people. The available evidence strongly suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect and that enactment of state medical marijuana laws has not increased adolescent marijuana use.”
01	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Consider that brain tumors have not increased in incidence in correlation with cellphone use. If cellphones were an important cause of brain tumors, we would have seen an increase perhaps starting in the 1990s, when cellphones came into widespread use, or starting several years later, if it took several years of cellphone use to cause a brain tumor. While the number of people diagnosed with brain tumors has risen, the increase has been mainly among the elderly, who use cellphones less than others. The increase started before the 1990s, and the numbers have leveled off. The increase is believed to be largely due to our improved detection of brain tumors using CT scans and MRI. Also, there is no known scientific mechanism by which mobile phones might cause brain tumors. For carcinogenic chemicals and other environmental causes of cancer, we can generally show that these cause mutations in DNA or changes in other molecules, sufficient to explain the resulting cancers. However, radiofrequency emissions such as those emitted by cellphones generally pass through tissues without causing these effects. Numerous epidemiologic studies considered together do not conclusively show an increase in risk of brain tumors associated with cellphone use.”

Nevertheless, considerable changes have occurred since then: a botched rollout of the insurance exchanges; unilateral changes made by the Administration to exempt certain groups from complying with key aspects of the law; technical adjustments to CBO's baseline projections for federal health spending; updated economic forecasts; a better understanding of the labor market effects of the legislation; and a new 10-year budget window...  Altogether, the SBC Republican staff analysis finds that after taking these significant changes since 2012 into account, the Democrats' health care law will increase the budget deficit by $131 billion over the current 10-year budget window (FY 2015–2024). This estimate is arrived at by taking the $180 billion in projected deficit reduction from the CBO 2012 extrapolation and then accounting for the lower net cost of the coverage provisions ($83 billion), the lower estimated federal health care savings under the plan ($132 billion), as well as the lower projected revenue levels when including the labor market effects of the legislation ($262 billion). The difference between the 2012 extrapolation and the current estimate of the cost of the Democrats' health law amounts to a $311 billion change in its net deficit impact."""

Human migration routes are like rivers: If they hit an obstacle, the flow finds a way around it. So a wall will just lead smugglers to find new routes and methods — planes, boats and 31-foot ladders for a 30-foot wall — even as it is being built, further undercutting confidence in the barrier's effectiveness. Nor would Trump's wall address the growth in illegal immigration from Asia, which outpaces immigration from Latin America… Perhaps most important, a wall could do nothing to halt the growing trend of people entering the country legally (often by plane) and then not leaving, which by some estimates accounts for as much as half of the undocumented immigration."""

A strong empirical record demonstrates that DTC communications about prescription medicines serve the public health by: Increasing awareness about diseases; Educating patients about treatment options; Motivating patients to contact their physicians and engage in a dialogue about health concerns; Increasing the likelihood that patients will receive appropriate care for conditions that are frequently under-diagnosed and under-treated; and Encouraging compliance with prescription drug treatment regimens… PhRMA members want patients and consumers to talk to their physicians about the medicines that may help them and to fully understand the known risks regarding these medicines. We know that DTC communications, particularly DTC television advertising, can be a powerful tool for reaching and educating millions of people.”
01	Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System?	"""My feeling is that cap-and-trade legislation should be pursued in 2009, recession be darned. Benefit-cost analyses indicate that addressing climate change, at least in a small way and then 'ramping up' to something more significant over time, is a good idea.  The economic case for cap-and-trade (or a carbon tax) is clear. Climate change and the associated negative impacts of emissions are known in economics as negative externalities. Much theoretical and empirical research supports an environmental regulation that taxes the polluting activity (or, equivalently, capping the pollution with permits and allowing polluters to trade the permits). The additional production cost of taxes or permits causes profits to be lower in the polluting industries, the supply of the polluting product falls and price of the polluting good rises. As the price of polluting goods rise consumers use less of the polluting good. As the price of nonrenewable energy rises and the price of renewable energy falls (with technological improvement) we reach the Hotelling 'switch point' and the demand for renewable energy rises. The price of nonrenewable energy is, more or less, capped at the price of the renewable substitute and the world is a greener place."""

"""The addition of the words 'under God' to the Pledge, and the school district's policy and practice of teacher-led recitation of the Pledge, do not violate the Establishment Clause... Indeed, the best evidence suggests just the opposite: The Establishment Clause was designed not just to prevent the establishment of a national church but to prohibit the federal government from interfering with state encouragement of religion as the states exercised their core police powers to protect the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the people. To hold that the Constitution prohibits the State or school district from allowing the recitation of a pledge that acknowledges the existence of God would ignore the history and intent of the First Amendment and would undermine the efforts of the States to foster the kind of moral virtue the Founders thought essential to the perpetuation of republican institutions."""

More than 27 per cent of Australian children aged five to 17 are overweight or obese. The figures in Britain and the US are similar… Obesity is a big problem. An existential problem.

01	Is There a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide?	"""As a matter of common sense, killing yourself is a lot harder than having someone do it for you. Assuming this bit of common sense is correct, there is reason to suppose that people, on average, are less susceptible to being pressured into killing themselves than they are into letting someone kill them...   A second consequence of the common sense point concerns the acts of suicide and submission to euthanasia that would in fact occur as a result of legalization. One natural way to understand the thought that killing yourself is harder than having someone do it for you is that killing yourself requires firmer resolve. The element of passivity involved in your letting another perform the unpleasant task of putting you out of your misery means that your will is not as active as it would be if you performed the task yourself, and thus weakness or irresolution in the will is less likely to cause failure, less likely to cause an interruption in the lethal action. Conversely, then, a completed act of suicide warrants more confidence in its having issued from a will that was strong or resolute than does a completed act of submission to euthanasia. Accordingly, though any act by which a person deliberately hastens his or her death raises concerns about its voluntariness, there is less reason to worry, other things being equal, about the voluntariness of suicide than about the voluntariness of submitting to euthanasia...   One can, to be sure, imagine physician-assisted suicides that are not significantly different from submitting to euthanasia. Assisted suicides in which the amount of assistance is so great as to reduce the patient's role to that of merely taking the very last steps, nothing more than opening a mouth, say, and intentionally swallowing a capsule placed therein by the physician are, practically speaking, equivalent to submitting voluntarily to active euthanasia. And if such suicides were typical of the suicides that resulted from legalizing the practice, then one could not seriously object to conflating it with voluntary active euthanasia when making utilitarian arguments against their legalization... But neither Kamisar [see Yale Kamisar] nor, as far as one can tell, any of the prominent opponents of legalization he cites offers reasons to think that such suicides would be typical. """

When I went to public school, every Friday we got tested on vocabulary. And you know what? It was a way to make sure you know what assiduous meant, and that’s very important. And we got tested on math and if I got things wrong, then I went back to try to learn them and my teacher went back to try to help me understand them. Now if all you do at the end of a block is move onto the next block, what happens is what happens in many public schools, people move through the system without acquiring the knowledge and the skills they need. And when they get to the end, they drop out or fail out or don’t succeed, and so assessment is an absolutely essential—it’s not the only part—but it’s an absolutely essential part of the educational equation.”

10	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“In summary, my review of the literature suggests that most studies claiming that there is no link between cell phones and brain tumors are outdated, had methodological concerns, and did not include sufficient numbers of long-term cell phone users to find an effect, since most of these negative studies primarily examined people with only a few years of phone use and did not inquire about cordless phone use. In addition, many studies defined regular cell phone use as ‘once a week’… [S]ome recent studies in Nordic countries, where phones have been used longest, find that persons who have used cell phones for at least a decade have 30% to more than 200% more brain tumors than do those without such use, and only on the side of the head where the user holds his or her phone. To put these numbers in context, this is at least as high an increase as the added risk of breast cancer that women face from long-term use of hormone replacement therapy. Based on these findings and the increased absorption into the brains of the young, the French Ministry of Health advised that children should be discouraged from using cell phones, a position also taken by British, German and other authorities… RF radiation emitted by cell phones should be considered a potential human health risk… From my careful review of the evidence, I cannot tell you conclusively that phones cause cancer or other diseases. But, I can tell you that there are published peer reviewed studies that have led me to suspect that long term cell phone use may cause cancer. It should be noted in this regard that worldwide, there are three billion regular cell phone users, including a rapidly growing number of children. If we wait until the human evidence is irrefutable and then act, an extraordinarily large number of people will have been exposed to a technology that has never really been shown to be safe.”

10	Is Global Oil Production at (or past) Its Peak?	"""'Peak oil' predictions about the impending decline in global rates of oil production are based on scant evidence and dubious models of how the oil market responds to scarcity...  The pessimistic claims about peaking oil supplies should be treated with skepticism. For decades, analysts have argued that oil supplies were dwindling and that the peak rate of production would soon been reached. In fact, the most eminent advocates of that argument today once predicted that the global production peak would occur in 1989, but since then global crude oil production has grown by 23 percent, and oil supply (crude oil and other petroleum liquids) has grown by more than 28 percent. More telling, the world's ultimately recoverable resources (URR) have been growing over time, largely because many fields contain substantially more oil than was originally believed.  The results of the growing URR and recovery rate are striking: in 1972 the 'life-index' of global oil reserves, the length of time that known reserves could support the current rate of production, was 35 years; in 2003, after 31 more years of accelerating oil extraction, the life index stood at 40 years. In short, no one knows how much oil is ultimately recoverable from the earth, but there is no compelling evidence that reserves are running out or that production is near the peak...  In sum, the simple peak oil argument that suggests that the world is running out of oil is unconvincing; oil will remain the foundation of the global economy for decades to come."""
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""It is [for] some time that I have been pointing out that the introduction of an ad-hoc regulation for prostitution in Italy is most urgent for a number of reasons: fight against organized crime, rehabilitation of certain areas of our towns and for health-related conditions. In reorganizing prostitution we could follow the examples set by such towns as Amsterdam and Berlin, where prostitution is restricted to specific areas or to specific places which are regularly controlled by health and tax inspectors. The means to enforce a regulation for prostitution may vary but the end is only one: take prostitutes away from the street and from the criminal gangs and keep an activity which is presently more or less underground under tax and health controls."""
10	Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?	"""It's beyond time to declare partition of the land both unworkable and unethical. Despite 20 years of this fiction, two decades of dreamers, cynics, Israel lobbyists, politicians, journalists, officials, liberal Zionists and pundits pronouncing the two-state solution the only game in town, it's over. Finished. Israel killed it by pursuing its natural Zionist, expansionist tendencies. The result is that Israel has succeeded in conquering the West Bank but ended its chances of remaining a Jewish state… The only viable alternative, and one gaining increasing traction, is the one-state solution… A one-state equation isn't about dismissing or ignoring Jewish history, but recognising the land is shared between two peoples and a soon-to-be minority Jewish population has no legal or ethical right to control a majority Arab people.  On its current path, despite some mainstream Israeli politicians advocating the illegal annexation of the West Bank to create an indefinite apartheid state, Israel will become increasingly ghettoised and militarised, convincing once-proud diaspora supporters to decide between their morality and Zionist loyalties. The time for a one-state solution has surely come."""
10	Do Physicians Support Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""When it comes to Obamacare most of the focus is on the broken website and the problems enrolling people into the coverage, but the real failures of this plan go well beyond the internet...  Obamacare seeks to lower the cost of health care, but instead it creates new arrangements that will only make medical care more expensive...  I don't consider it successful if the only way we reduce the roles of the uninsured in this country is by obligating more Americans to a Medicaid program that is quite literally worsening medical outcomes...  Obamacare makes so many costly promises on paper, but the only way to pay for these commitments is to reduce what providers are paid. And Obamacare, this is now a network that contains a very short list of providers and closed drug formularies that leave key medicines uncovered. And the Obamacare regulations don't just apply to the Obamacare plans. This is a federalization of all insurance in this country, so everyone's benefits need to conform to the single, uniform national standard. Obamacare was a response to a flawed healthcare system. There's no question about that. But it makes things worse."""
10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""It's ironic that a food process instituted back in the 1920s and 30s to prevent real, milk-borne disease, is now being demonized as a cause of nutrient depletion (which it is not). Indeed, some raw milk advocates blame pasteurized milk for everything from infant colic to osteoporosis, heart disease, and cancer (have they been talking to the anti-aspartame lobby?). None of this is true...   While raw milk may taste somewhat sweeter than the pasteurized variety, this hardly makes up for the fact that it is considerably more likely to carry disease-causing microorganisms. Indeed, as we have noted in the past, there have been well-documented outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 infection in children, an infection that can result in permanent kidney damage, if not death.   We can only hope that the public health community exerts itself to counter the spread of the raw milk myth."""

01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	“[T]ax exemption is not something churches (or any nonprofit voluntary organizations, for that matter) win by ‘good’ behavior or lose by ‘bad’ behavior, as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ may be defined at will by incumbant officials from day to day. Churches have their essential function to perform, which they do—and have done for decades and centuries—as best they can, and which outsiders, particularly government officials, cannot judge, and—even if they could—do not have the wisdom, means or right to try to improve the churches’ performance. Loss of tax exemption will not make poorly functioning churches function better, and the threat of it will only have a ‘chilling effect’ on those that are not doing too well as it is, so that they will tend to falter and ‘lose their nerve’ and do even less well. Tax exemption is not something to be turned on and off like a spigot, but an optimum, constant condition for allowing the religious function to be performed in a ‘free market’ situation, where would-be practitioners are allowed to ‘sink or swim’ on the basis of how well they meet the religious needs of adherents—without governmental interference, either to hinder or to ‘help’ (which is still to hinder). One does not have to be a partisan of one religion or of any to appreciate and wish to maintain this commendable ‘hands off’ neutrality of government toward religion, which the First Amendment commands, and which tax exemption so excellently epitomizes.”

The cortex does not become functional until at least the 26th week of a fetus' development, long after most abortions are performed. This finding was endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, [1] which stated that that there is ""no legitimate scientific information that supports the statement that a fetus experiences pain."" [142] A University of California at San Francisco study said fetuses probably can't feel pain until the 29th or 30th week of gestation. [166] Abortions that late into a pregnancy are extremely rare and are often restricted by state laws. [164] According to Stuart W. G. Derbyshire, PhD, Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham (UK), ""fetuses cannot be held to experience pain. Not only has the biological development not yet occurred to support pain experience, but the environment after birth, so necessary to the development of pain experience, is also yet to occur.""

10	Should the US Subsidize Alternative Energies?	"""For at least the last thirty years the alternative energy industry has been claiming they are almost ready to be economically competitive with fossil fuel. Wind, solar, geothermal, and others keep begging for government subsidies to help them stay afloat until they can reach a size at which economies of scale kicks in, price per kilowatt hour drops, and then they can survive on their own. Now we are seeing this has been a blatant grab for taxpayer dollars and the subsidies were more about industry executives and shareholders getting rich than about reaching a green industry future…  How big an assist has solar been getting in competing economically? Quite a large assist. Solar installations, both residential and commercial, receive a 30 percent investment tax credit, meaning solar makes economic sense even when they are 29 percent more expensive than alternatives. A 30 percent subsidy can make a Mercedes cheaper than a Hyundai … Give solar some credit. It has cut costs by about two percent per year for over thirty years straight. The industry now installs as much solar capacity in a month as took five years just a decade ago. These are tremendous gains in scale and in cost efficiency ... So, after all those successes, why is solar still so uncompetitive that the industry would suffer catastrophic damage without government largess? Personally, I am beginning to think that thirty years of promises may have been hollow. How long are taxpayers supposed to put up with promises of 'just a little bit longer' when asking how long the subsidies must continue?...  The time has come to use the industry's own admissions against it in the court of public opinion. The industry is lobbying for an extension of its investment tax credit so it can continue to profit at the taxpayer's expense. Taxpayers ought to lobby their elected representatives to allow the solar tax credit to expire. Tell Congress enough is enough. It is time for solar to face the marketplace on its own."""
10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""A few years ago, prostitutes disappeared from the pages of medical journals; they returned as 'sex workers.' Nor did they work in prostitution any more: they were employees in the 'sex industry.' Presumably, orgasms are now a consumer product just like any other. As for pimps, the correct term is probably: 'brief sexual liaison coordinators.'   The editors who decided on the new terminology almost certainly felt, and probably still do feel, a warm glow of self-satisfaction (one of the few emotions than never lets you down). How they must have prided themselves on their broadmindedness, as they strove to reduce the small-minded stigma traditionally attached to offering sexual services in return for money! How morally brave and daring they must have felt, to fly so boldly in the face of two millennia of unthinking condemnation!...   The idea of the state coercing its population into prostitution is, of course, repellent. Even the most liberal of liberals would probably agree with that. This means that there is after all a moral difference between prostitution and washing dishes in the local restaurant or stacking supermarket shelves. And that prostitution is both age-old and ineradicable does not make it any less degrading to all concerned."""

This observation does not abrogate thousands of years of anecdotal evidence and over one hundred years of support by prominent figures in the medical establishment… While double blind studies are certainly important, in the United States such studies have not been allowed… Dr. Russo, a well respected neurologist, author, researcher and North American Consultant to GW Pharmaceuticals, tried for four years to get the federal government to approve just such a double blind research project. They refused… Just as a historical note; when aspirin was first used for treating headaches no double blind studies were done, yet we still believe that aspirin treats headaches. Aspirin was based on centuries of use of willow bark by Native Americans. Aspirin was grand-mothered in by the 1938 Food, Cosmetics and Drug Act and to the best of my knowledge has never received modern FDA approval because it never had to.

10	Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun?	“Allowing untrained, or under-trained, persons to carry loaded hidden handguns in public puts people at risk of being killed or injured, intentionally and unintentionally. It also makes it harder for law enforcement to identify the real perpetrators during a shooting. Allowing more people to carry concealed handguns in densely populated cities, on crowded subways, buses and sports stadiums, is a recipe for disaster… Almost every major law enforcement organization — including the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and the International Association of Chiefs of Police — thinks law enforcement should have discretion over the carrying of concealed handguns in public… The public is overwhelmingly against allowing regular citizens to bring their guns into public places like sports stadiums, college campuses and bars.”

01	Free College - Top 3 Pros and Cons	The US economy and society has benefited from tuition-free college in the past. Nearly half of all college students in 1947 were military veterans, thanks to President Roosevelt signing the GI Bill in 1944 to ensure military servicemembers, veterans, and their dependents could attend college tuition-free. The GI Bill allowed 2.2 million veterans to earn a college education, and another 5.6 million to receive vocational training, all of which helped expand the middle class. [7][8][9] An estimated 40% of those veterans would not have been able to attend college otherwise. GI Bill recipients generated an extra $35.6 billion over 35 years and an extra $12.8 billion in tax revenue, resulting in a return of $6.90 for every dollar spent. [10] The beneficiaries of the free tuition contributed to the economy by buying cars and homes, and getting jobs after college, while not being burdened by college debt. They contributed to society with higher levels of volunteering, voting, and charitable giving. [11] The 1944 GI Bill paid for the educations of 22,000 dentists, 67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 teachers, 240,000 accountants, 450,000 engineers, three Supreme Court Justices (Rehnquist, Stevens, and White), three presidents (Nixon, Ford, and H.W.

01	Does Obamacare Require Payment Cuts to Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare Part C)? - YES	"""Since the 1970s, Medicare beneficiaries have had the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private health plans, mainly health maintenance organizations (HMOs), as an alternative to the federally administered traditional Medicare program. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 named Medicare's managed care program 'Medicare+Choice' and the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 renamed it 'Medicare Advantage.'  Over the past decades, Medicare payment policy for plans has shifted from one that produced savings to one that focused more on expanding access to private plans and providing extra benefits to Medicare private plan enrollees. These policy changes resulted in Medicare paying private plans more per enrollee than the cost of care for beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, on average (MedPAC 2010). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 produced another shift in payment policy by reducing federal payments to Medicare Advantage plans over time, bringing them closer to the average costs of care under the traditional Medicare program."""

The author went into great detail about how the decision is made...  The purpose of this process, according to the prosecutor, is to ensure that only the guilty are subjected to a potential death sentence. In fact, if there is any real doubt about the guilt, then death is off the table.  Sound like a great system? It is. So what’s the concern? My concern is not with the system but with the article. The author believes that this is a unique procedure when in reality many, if not most, prosecutors review death and many other serious cases in a very similar manner...  Our responsibility is to protect the public from those who commit crimes and to protect those who do not commit crimes from unwarranted prosecution. Because of our critical role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, we are and should be subjected to a closer scrutiny than others. The courts, media, bar associations and, most importantly, the public we serve all review our conduct on a daily basis. Our obligation to the public is to see that justice is served in every case.

Though many people assume that the oath is still taken, it is rarely administered in its original form, if at all. In any case, to assess the oath’s relevance, one must examine what it precludes and what it recommends. Modern medicine has already ignored the fact that the oath precludes the following: 'to cut for stone' (a common urological procedure) and to 'use the knife,' which would prohibit surgery altogether. How relevant are these preclusions today?  The oath also directs physicians, including me, to 'help the sick.' So a modern interpretation of the oath might be: Do what is right for the patient.

Climate changes on every time scale – whether decades, centuries or millennia. The climate of Greenland was warm enough for farming around the year 1100 A.D., but by 1500, the Little Ice Age drove Norse settlers out… But none of the climate change of the past was due to humans. The very minor warming in the past few centuries is mostly from non-human causes as well… Yes, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, but much less important than the major greenhouse gas, water vapor, H2O, and clouds. Observations, including the extended ‘hiatus’ in warming since about the year 2000 – which is poised to continue now that the El Nino warming of 2015-2016 is behind us – show that more atmospheric carbon dioxide will cause only modest warming of the Earth’s surface. Many sincere people, without the time or training to dig into the facts, have been misled by the demonization of carbon dioxide. This seems to be a recurrent feature of human history. In past centuries, some of the most educated members of society wrote learned books on how to ferret out witches and presided in trials where witches were condemned to death. There never was a threat from witches, and there is no threat from increasing carbon dioxide.”
01	Does Legal Prostitution Lead to Human Trafficking and Slavery?	"""[M]odels of complete decriminalisation and legalisation of the sex industry increase trafficking inflows by fostering demand for the sexual exploitation of women and girls...   Legalisation or decriminalisation of the sex industry is often touted as a way to weed out organised crime in the industry and reduce the associated illegal trafficking inflows. However, evidence shows that legalization / decriminalisation only increases flows of women trafficked into the industry and provides a legitimate front for organised crime, while at the same time reducing police oversight of the industry."""

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“[T]he most obvious point against uniforms is that they restrict self-expression. We live in a dynamic society, full of unique characters that make our world a spontaneous one. Cutting that off at a young age only stifles creativity and encourages conformity. We want to encourage our children to be expressive and to think outside the box. Forcing them to wear ugly gray sweater vests and starched white shirts is not the way to do that. The gender-specific uniform guidelines often reinforce the gender binary in the school environment. The separation between females and males will only increase. If uniforms were all-encompassing and non-gender specific, this problem would not exist. However, uniforms are not all-encompassing. There are limited choices for males and limited choices for females. Though females can wear uniform pants, men are not allowed to wear uniform jumpers. Conflict would arise if a male attempted to wear the specified ‘female’ attire. This poses problems to LGBT progress in school environments… [W]here did we get the idea that bullying and stereotypes would magically disappear if we implemented a strict uniform? People will not stop bullying each other based on appearance, which manifests itself in ways besides clothing. If we convince ourselves that placing limits on clothing choices will eliminate school bullying, we are kidding ourselves.”
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“In 1982 I accepted appointment to the Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving and agreed to chair its Education and Prevention Committee. The Commission met over the next 18 months and ultimately advanced 39 recommendations to President Reagan… The most conspicuous of those recommendations, and arguably the most controversial, called for raising the minimum legal drinking age to 21 nationwide… In the interest of maintaining unanimity, I reluctantly voted yes. It is the single most regrettable decision of my entire professional career Legal Age 21 has not worked. To be sure, drunk driving fatalities are lower now than they were in 1982. But they are lower in all age groups. And they have declined just as much in Canada, where the age is 18 or 19, as they have in the United States. But even if we concede that the law has had some effect on our highways, we cannot overlook its collateral, off-road damage. The National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, which I founded in 1970, estimates that 5,000 lives are lost to alcohol each year by those under 21. More than 3,000 of those fatalities occur off our roadways… And if we broaden our look, we see a serious problem of reckless, goal-oriented, drinking to get drunk. Those at whom the law is directed disobey it routinely. Enforcement is frustratingly difficult and usually forces the behavior deeper underground, into places where life and health are put at ever greater risk. The 600,000 assaults reported annually, the date rapes, the property damage, the emergency room calls do not in general occur in places visible to the public. They are the inevitable result of what happens when laws do not reflect social or cultural reality. The reality is that at age 18 in this country, one is a legal adult. Young people view 21 as utterly arbitrary — which it is… [T]here is no evidence of massive brain impairment, alcohol dependency, or underage alcohol abuse, which the ‘experts’ tell us will be the inevitable result of lowering the age in the United States. But so long as the age remains a one-size-fits-all, federally-mandated 21, and so long as any state that may want to try something different, in hopes of reversing the dismal trend of binge-drinking that (maybe or maybe not coincidentally) has become more serious in the years since the drinking age was raised, forfeits 10% of its federal highway funds, nothing is likely to change for the better.”
01	Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?	“[T]he vast majority of young people, whether in college or not, consume alcohol long before they turn 21… Science, it is argued, supports a law that makes abstinence and enforcement the only tools a parent or a university may employ on young violators, whose numbers are vast and whose ingenuity in avoiding detection is increasingly acute. Experience, on the other hand, suggests that ‘just say no’ and ‘we will enforce the law without exception’ are not the most effective ways to enable young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol. Yet science can be tricky. Alcohol-related traffic fatalities reached a 10-year high in 2006. Fatalities in Puerto Rico, where the drinking age is 18, dropped by 11% last year. Half of the peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the drinking age on fatalities show a positive correlation. Half show no correlation at all. The drinking age has effectively banished alcohol from public places and public view. But it has done little to reduce drinking. If you were to design the ideal venue for binge drinking, you would not design a student union, a dining hall, a restaurant or any public gathering place. You would instead design a locked dorm room, an off-campus apartment, a farmer’s field – in short, a place conducive to clandestine behaviour. And that is exactly where binge drinking is taking place, in the most risky of environments. Ironically, the more successful a college is in enforcing the law – carding underage drinkers, braceleting those of legal age, limiting quantities, posting campus security – the greater the likelihood that alcohol consumption will simply move to a place out of campus sight and often beyond campus boundaries, effectively placing that behaviour out of reach of campus authority. The result? More than 1,000 lives of 18-24 year olds are being lost each year to alcohol off the highways, and this number is increasing. Supporters of the law continue to urge abstinence and enforcement. Such an approach makes no allowance for human judgment or discretion, for a consideration of the unique circumstances that surround every incident that ultimately becomes another impersonal piece of data.”
01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""To end abuses in the sex industry, the Netherlands decided to change the law to reflect everyday reality. It is now legal to employ prostitutes who are over the age of consent, and do the work voluntarily, but stricter measures have been introduced under criminal law to prevent exploitation.   The legalisation of brothels enables the government to exercise more control over the sex industry and counter abuses. The police conduct frequent controls of brothels and are thus in a position to pick up signs of human trafficking. This approach is in the interests of prostitutes themselves, and it facilitates action against sexual violence and abuse and human trafficking...  An important spin-off of the policy is that it prevents human trafficking, which is characterised by exploitation, coercion and violence. The lifting of the ban on brothels makes prostitution a legitimate occupation and gives prostitutes the same rights and protection as other professionals.  The labour laws offer the most effective protection against exploitation, violence and coercion. The policy is based on the conviction that strengthening the position of women is the best way to combat sexual violence. Moreover, abuses are easier to detect when prostitutes operate publicly and legally rather than in a clandestine subculture."""

10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“I have been adamant in saying that Social Security should not be privatized and it will not be privatized as long as I’m President. And here’s the reason. I was opposed to it before the financial crisis. And what I said was the purpose of Social Security is to have that floor, that solid — rock-solid security, so that no matter what else happens you’ve always got some income to support you in your retirement. And I’ve got no problem with people investing in their 401(k)s, and we want to encourage people to invest in private savings accounts. But Social Security has to be separate from that… So here’s the thing. Social Security is not in crisis. What is happening is, is that the population is getting older, which means we’ve got more retirees per worker than we used to. We’re going to have to make some modest adjustments in order to strengthen it. There are some fairly modest changes that could be made without resorting to any newfangled schemes that would continue Social Security for another 75 years, where everybody would get the benefits that they deserve.”
01	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	Social Security taxes have become excessive. The maximum Social Security tax instituted by the Social Security Act of 1935 was $60; as of 2015 it is $7,347 for employees and employers – which is over 700% higher than inflation. [29] The Social Security tax rate has risen from 2% to 6%, and is as high as 12% for the self-employed. The amount of income that is subject to payroll tax has climbed from $3,000 in 1935 to $118,500 in 2015. [30] [31] Rather than having so much of their earnings be taken by the government in the form of high Social Security taxes, money put into private accounts would remain under each worker's control.

[60] Americans are permitted to travel to other communist countries, nations known for human rights violations, and even places on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

01	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“There is growing research on the effects of videogames on children… Studies of children exposed to violence have shown that they can become: ‘immune’ or numb to the horror of violence, imitate the violence they see, and show more aggressive behavior with greater exposure to violence. Some children accept violence as a way to handle problems. Studies have also shown that the more realistic and repeated the exposure to violence, the greater the impact on children. In addition, children with emotional, behavioral and learning problems may be more influenced by violent images. Children and adolescents can become overly involved and even obsessed with videogames. Spending large amounts of time playing these games can create problems and lead to… aggressive thoughts and behaviors.”

Overall, to summarize, she said [p. 179] ‘Marijuana was ranked lowest for withdrawal symptoms, tolerance and dependence (addiction) potential; it ranked close to caffeine in the degree of reinforcement and higher than caffeine and nicotine only in the degree of intoxication.’ Even in cases of high daily intake, such as the 94-day cannabis study (Cohen 1976), any withdrawal symptoms on its sudden cessation were transient and mild. All four of the Missoula Chronic Use study patients occasionally found themselves without cannabis medicine. None have ever experienced any withdrawal symptoms, but rather, merely an increase in symptoms that cannabis treated for them.”

As leaders in women’s health, nurses can and should use their positions to advocate for comprehensive health care services for all, especially women and infants. It is clear that absence of insurance contributes to lack of access to basic health care services that help keep people well. People who are uninsured are at greater risk for negative health consequences. Researchers confirm that these people are less likely to receive preventive, recommended, and follow-up care, including prescriptions. The consequences of not seeking care can be severe, especially when preventable conditions, chronic diseases, or life-threatening diseases go undetected. As a result, people without insurance are in worse health than those with insurance and they are more frequently hospitalized for preventable conditions.”

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	“What gold brings to the monetary table is discipline. If individuals suspect that money is being issued in excess of levels warranted by legitimate economic needs and growth prospects, they can exchange their currency holdings for gold at a pre-established, fixed rate. Gold convertibility ensures that the money supply expands or contracts based on the collective assessment of market participants – as opposed to the less-than-omniscient hunches of central bankers. Gold provides a self-correcting mechanism for irrational exuberance; as credit begins to flow too freely, as equity values or commodity prices appear frothy, the astute observer at the margin cashes out in gold. Monetary central planning gives way to the aggregate wisdom of the free market. A gold standard brakes runaway government spending. It allows individuals to defeat governments that dilute the value of money… Under a gold standard, money regains its primary purpose as a vital tool of free markets instead of serving as a corrupted instrument of government policy. Genuine economic growth – as opposed to the money illusion of artificial wealth reflected in bloated equities or housing prices – is no longer sacrificed to monetary policy encumbered by the fiscal failures of government… One could say, of course, that a balanced budget is no panacea either – but it imposes needed discipline on fiscal decision-making. In the same way, monetary policy needs some discipline to prevent the dollar from being the default mechanism for enabling government mismanagement. Gold convertibility would signal that we intend to maintain the integrity of our currency. It’s all about trajectory and confidence; sound money makes it real.”

10	Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?	"""A more pragmatic solution would be to offer a path to legalization that stops short of citizenship. That would meet the humanitarian imperative to keep families together. But it would also hold those who have violated immigration laws accountable for their actions. This would apply only to undocumented workers who were of legal age when they entered the United States; those who were not of legal age should be given a citizenship path identical to the one that is available to legal immigrants.   Except for those who were born on American soil, citizenship is not a right. It's a privilege. A path short of citizenship sends a powerful message to America's legal-immigrant community, whose members have worked tirelessly to follow existing immigration guidelines. There is a rule of law, and citizenship is granted to those who follow it."""
10	Is the Pledge of Allegiance a Religious Exercise?

Children, illegal immigrants, the mentally incompetent and felons do not meet those standards. Put another way: If you are not willing to follow the law, you cannot demand a right to make the law for everyone else.  The right to vote can be restored, but it should be done carefully, not automatically, and on a case-by-case basis... a three-year waiting period after serving a prison term is reasonable, given that 'two-thirds of released prisoners are rearrested and one-half are re-incarcerated within three years of release from prison,' according to a report by Harvard University’s Richard Freeman."""

01	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Contrary to stereotypes of paid sex, work in a legal brothel is not especially dangerous or hazardous to one's health.

They take pride in their ability to give not only physical pleasure, but also emotional support, to needy people who cannot get sex any other way.  If sex work is not going to disappear anytime soon, anyone who cares about the health and safety of sex workers – not to mention their rights – should support moves to make it a fully legal industry. That is what most sex workers want as well...  [C]ountries that criminalize the sex industry should consider the harms these laws cause, as Amnesty International has done.

10	Are Mass Deportations a Good Method to Address Illegal Immigration?	"""Deporting 11 million people would be a population transfer so large it only has a couple historical precedents, and one of them is Adolf Hitler's. To extract that many people from their communities would require a much larger and more determined effort that [sic] Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is capable of at present…   Sending an amped-up ICE on a mass-deportation mission wouldn't just be an assault on undocumented people and their families, it would be an attack on American cities, where more than 90 percent of them live. For large municipalities, rigorously enforcing immigration law is unfeasible but also politically unpopular. So-called 'sanctuary cities' have declared their ongoing intention to drag their feet when it comes to cooperating with the Feds. For example, law enforcement in many cities (including New York) selectively complies with ICE requests to hold people in custody on suspicion of being undocumented. ICE can't do their job without local cooperation and the use of these legally questionable detention orders has decreased by more than 70 percent in the last four years."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	"Human-produced CO2 is re-absorbed by oceans, forests, and other “carbon sinks,” negating any climate changes.

10	Is There a Moral Difference between Passive and Active Euthanasia?	"""The belief that doctors do not in fact kill requires the corollary belief that forgoing life-sustaining treatment, whether by not starting or by stopping treatment, is allowing to die, not killing. Common though this view is, I shall argue that it is confused and mistaken...   Consider the case of a patient terminally ill with ALS disease. She is completely respirator dependent with no hope of ever being weaned. She is unquestionably competent but finds her condition intolerable and persistently requests to be removed from the respirator and allowed to die. Most people and physicians would agree that the patient's physician should respect the patient's wishes and remove her from the respirator, though this will certainly cause the patient's death. The common understanding is that the physician thereby allows the patient to die. But is that correct?   Suppose the patient has a greedy and hostile son who mistakenly believes that his mother will never decide to stop her life-sustaining treatment and that even if she did her physician would not remove her from the respirator. Afraid that his inheritance will be dissipated by a long and expensive hospitalization, he enters his mother's room while she is sedated, extubates her, and she dies. Shortly thereafter the medical staff discovers what he has done and confronts the son. He replies, 'I didn't kill her, I merely allowed her to die. It was her ALS disease that caused her death,' I think this would rightly be dismissed as transparent sophistry [subtly deceptive reasoning] - the son went into his mother's room and deliberately killed her. But, of course, the son performed just the same physical actions, did just the same thing, that the physician would have done. If that is so, then doesn't the physician also kill the patient when he extubates her [removes the respirator]...   Both the physician and the greedy son act in a manner intended to cause death, do cause death, and so both kill."""
10	Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?	"""Foods of animal origin in general naturally contain hormones, but cow's milk may be of particular concern. The hormones naturally found even in organic cow's milk may have played a role in studies that found a relationship between dairy products and human illnesses, such as acne, certain cancers, and male reproductive disorders. Milk consumption has also been associated with an increased risk of early puberty in girls and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women."""
10	Should the US Immediately Phase out Fossil Fuels?	"""If the world in which we lived were one where alternative energy sources were reliable, constant and even marginally cost-competitive, the question posed above would take on the status of a non sequitur. After all, if alternative energy could survive without taxpayer subsidization, it wouldn't be an 'alternative' energy at all. But it can't, and so it is. And there's a good reason for it.   Here are the facts: eighty-five percent of the energy Americans use today to heat their homes, light their lives, and get from here to there come from so-called fossil fuels – power derived from oil, natural gas, and coal. In the space that remains, nuclear energy accounts for almost nine percent of total U.S. energy. Biomass and hydroelectricity claim almost all that's left. Wind and solar, where art thou? Combined, these two dynamos account for less than one percent of our energy - despite decades of hefty government subsidies spent trying to create them...  So, when you add it all up, the question really boils down to this: Should we immediately phase out ninety-seven percent of the energy we need to survive and prosper, cross our fingers and hope that the most expensive, unreliable, but politically preferred sources of energy will make up the difference?   Sure, why not? As long as we're all willing to sacrifice our jobs, devastate our economy, surrender the nation's place in the world, and cash in the quality of life that abundant, affordable energy has provided for us all – in return for little or no environmental benefit – then yeah, let's do it."""
01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“People get high on nature, ‘high on life,’ ‘high on God,’ high on chocolate, coffee, beer, tobacco – even TV, exercise and meditation alter your consciousness. Watching television is the biggest escape from reality of them all. Who gave prohibitionists the power to dictate what everyone else can and cannot do for fun?… The core issues are personal choice and responsibility. Cannabis consumers are seeking the same respect and fundamental rights as anybody else, which is what they deserve. Neither the Constitution nor the Bible forbids cannabis use. The Bible states point blank that God gave us ‘every seed bearing herb’ to use, and saw that it was good. The Declaration of Independence affirms our right to ‘the pursuit of happiness’… The laws against cannabis are an attack against the gifts of God/nature and the rule of law. No matter how you feel about people ‘getting high,’ these other principles are too important to allow government to violate our personal rights. So if you don’t think people should get high, it is your right to not get high and your right to discourage others to not get high, but that does not give any person or government the right to abuse the rights of people who feel otherwise. And to wage a war on cannabis users while society promotes alcohol and tolerates tobacco is hypocritical and immoral.”
10	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	“Health care is a service that we all need, but just like food and shelter it is best provided through voluntary and mutually beneficial market exchanges. A careful reading of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution will not reveal any intrinsic right to health care, food or shelter. That’s because there isn’t any. This ‘right’ has never existed in America. Even in countries like Canada and the U.K., there is no intrinsic right to health care. Rather, citizens in these countries are told by government bureaucrats what health-care treatments they are eligible to receive and when they can receive them. All countries with socialized medicine ration health care by forcing their citizens to wait in lines to receive scarce treatments. Although Canada has a population smaller than California, 830,000 Canadians are currently waiting to be admitted to a hospital or to get treatment, according to a report last month in Investor’s Business Daily. In England, the waiting list is 1.8 million… Rather than increase government spending and control, we need to address the root causes of poor health. This begins with the realization that every American adult is responsible for his or her own health.”
01	Is Obamacare a Socialist Law? - DEBATED	"""Obama is committed to socialism. I mean socialism in the broad sense. I'm not talking about a particular platform adopted by the International Socialist Movement in the late 19th century. I'm talking about a government-dominated, bureaucratically-controlled, politician-dictated way of life. Not only have we taken over GM, Chrysler and AIG, but there's a czar in the White House who believes he can establish the pay scale for 30 companies he's never been in, for hundreds of people he's never met. They just nationalized the student loan program. They designed Obamacare so there's a backdoor road to socialized medicine because it creates an incentive for companies to drop their employees. There's evidence that hundreds of companies may drop millions of employees from their health insurance and have them go buy individual insurance. So there are a lot of different practices that would lead us to believe this is a socialist operation."""

By switching to a personal retirement account system and taking advantage of compound asset growth we will be able to reduce that debt. Social Security’s costs are already there. By switching to personally invested retirement accounts we can move some of those costs forward and reduce Social Security’s debt and bring the system back into solvency. Tough decisions must be made about where to get the money to move those costs forward and pay them now so that we are not paying more later. While paying those costs now may seem expensive, it is much less expensive than continuing with the current system.”
10	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“I think we should have a tactical discussion [about drones]. Who is actually being killed? We don’t know who we’re killing in these signature strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. So if you don’t know who you’re killing, and you don’t necessarily have actual evidence that they’re involved with terror plots, and you’ve decided to engage in a sort of pre-crime where you preemptively label military-age males in certain regions terrorists and then kill them, that sends a certain message to the world that the United States is acting with impunity and believes it has the right to intervene in sovereign nations and conduct war even without the authority of its own lawmakers. I’m deeply concerned that the message we’re sending the world is going to cause blowback – that we’re going to get hit as a result of this, and that we lose our moral standing in the world.”
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""You can't fix a fundamentally broken law; you've got to replace it. That's why Congress can't save Obamacare with a few tweaks, despite what its defenders say. No quick fix can correct the main flaw: The law takes power away from patients and hands it to bureaucrats.  As millions of Americans have learned from their cancellation notices, Obamacare lets bureaucrats decide what insurance plans must cover. It buries doctors and hospitals in red tape. And it adds a whole host of new taxes and fees that drive up the cost of care. The law doesn't make people's health care decisions any easier; in many cases, it makes those decisions for them.  But the law's effects go far beyond the doctor's office, weighing down our economy and discouraging hiring. The law requires employers with more than 50 full-time employees to give them health insurance. But because the law defines 'full time' as 30 hours or more, employers are keeping employees below that threshold to avoid the mandate entirely."""

But... the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect.

FDA was intended to control new medicines, not medicines that had already been in use for hundreds or thousands of years. Morphine wasn’t approved by the FDA. Marijuana should not have been removed from the pharmacopoeia in the first place, and the AMA opposed its banning.” David Borden additionally wrote on Apr. 21, 2004: “Advocates have resorted to initiatives and lobbying because the government has blocked most medical marijuana research. Studies involving marijuana require a license from the DEA as well as a legal marijuana source. The only current legal domestic source for marijuana is the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), however, NIDA has been unwilling to provide marijuana to studies which it is not also funding. DEA has also refused to grant licenses to allow legal marijuana imports for medical research. The same officials who cite insufficient research to meet the FDA’s standards for drug approval have played a role in making sure that the research doesn’t take place. Recently some studies have been allowed, but not enough to allow the FDA process to proceed at a reasonable pace.”

01	Should Physicians Participate in Executions?	"""Accepting capital punishment in principle means accepting it in practice, whether by the hand of a physician or anyone else. If one approves of capital punishment in principle (as I do), then one must accept its practical consequences. If one finds the practice too brutal, one must either reject it in principle or seek to mitigate its brutality. If one chooses the latter option, then the participation of physicians seems more humane than delegating the deed to prison wardens, for by condoning the participation of untrained people who could inflict needless suffering that we physicians might have prevented, we are just as responsible as if we had inflicted the suffering ourselves.  The AMA [American Medical Association] position should be changed either to permit physician participation or to advocate the abolition of capital punishment.

So defined, prostitution is a service industry like any other in which people exchange skills for money or other reward...  Non-consenting adults and all children forced into sexual activity (commercial or otherwise) deserve the full protection of the law and perpetrators deserve full punishment by the law.  Workers in the sex industry deserve the same rights as workers in any other trade, including the right to legal protection from crimes such as sexual harassment, sexual abuse and rape...  There are some unscrupulous people in all walks of life -government, law, journalism, banking, law enforcement, the stock exchange, medicine, the clergy, prostitution, etc. If every profession were criminalised when some of its members broke the law, there would be few legally sanctioned professions.

Nor is it merely descriptive of the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the Republic. Rather, the phrase 'one nation under God' in the context of the Pledge is normative.

10	Banned Books - Top 3 Pros and Cons	"Books are a portal to different life experiences and reading encourages empathy and social-emotional development. One study found that reading J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, which is frequently challenged for religious concerns about witchcraft, ""improved attitudes"" about immigrants, homosexuals, and refugees. [11] Another study found that reading narrative fiction helped readers understand their peers and raised social abilities. [12][13] A study in Basic and Applied Social Psychology found that people who read a story about a Muslim woman were less likely to make broad judgments based on race. [14] Neil Gaiman, author of the frequently challenged novel Neverwhere, among other books, stated that fiction ""build[s] empathy... You get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed. Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals."" [15]"
10	Is a College Education Worth It?	“[I]n our society the default assumption is that everybody has to go to college… I believe you have a bubble whenever you have something that’s overvalued and intensely believed. In education, you have this clear price escalation without incredible improvement in the product. At the same time you have this incredible intensity of belief that this is what people have to do. In that way it seems very similar in some ways to the housing bubble and the tech bubble. …I think you increasingly have people who are graduating from college, not being able to get good jobs, moving back home with their parents… I think there’s a surprising openness to the idea that something’s gone badly wrong and needs to be fixed.”

10	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""[T]here is little doubt that unauthorized, that is, illegal, immigration has made a significant contribution to the growth of our economy. Between 2000 and 2007, for example, it accounted for more than a sixth of the increase in our total civilian labor force. The illegal part of the civilian labor force diminished last year as the economy slowed, though illegals still comprised an estimated 5% of our total civilian labor force. Unauthorized immigrants serve as a flexible component of our workforce, often a safety valve when demand is pressing and among the first to be discharged when the economy falters.  Some evidence suggests that unskilled illegal immigrants (almost all from Latin America) marginally suppress wage levels of native-born Americans without a high school diploma, and impose significant costs on some state and local governments.  However the estimated wage suppression and fiscal costs are relatively small, and economists generally view the overall economic benefits of this workforce as significantly outweighing the costs."""
01	Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?	"""Recent research on the relationship between capital punishment and homicide has created a consensus among most economists who have studied the issue that capital punishment deters murder. Early studies from the 1970s and 1980s reached conflicting results. However, recent studies have exploited better data and more sophisticated statistical techniques. The modern refereed studies have consistently shown that capital punishment has a strong deterrent effect, with each execution deterring between 3 and 18 murders...   The literature is easy to summarize: almost all modern studies and all the refereed studies find a significant deterrent effect of capital punishment. Only one study questions these results. To an economist, this is not surprising: we expect criminals and potential criminals to respond to sanctions, and execution is the most severe sanction available."""

Together with Shakespearean tragedies and Godfather movies and much else… The data show that video games have skyrocketed in popularity during exactly the historical period in which violent crime has sunk to the floor. And in the same age cohorts. I don’t think it’s because that we have some hydraulic urge to violence that has to be channeled through one conduit lest it burst out into another… partly these are independent developments, partly the beneficial effect of video games may just be that if you’re playing video games you’re not getting into trouble in other ways. And so the young men who are behind the screen are not out picking fights in bars or over parking spots.”

Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that it is safer to work in a nuclear plant than to work in the real estate or financial sectors...  New nuclear power plants cannot be built without a high degree of public confidence in the safety of the technology, the competence and commitment of reactor operators, and the dedication of regulators. The industry recognizes that public confidence is based on the performance of our current fleet of plants. We must remain ever vigilant to the safety responsibility entrusted to us...

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	"Civilians, including hunters, should not own military-grade firearms or firearm accessories. President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR-15 military rifle (also called M16s by the Air Force) should be owned by civilians and, when the AR-15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired on Sep. 13, 2004), the NRA supported the legislation. [48] The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding, detaching, or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried; silencers to muffle gunshot sounds; flash suppressors to fire in low-light conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter’s location; or grenade launcher attachments.

10	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Advertisements to the general public should help people to make rational decisions on the use of drugs determined to be legally available without a prescription. While they should take account of people’s legitimate desire for information regarding their health, they should not take undue advantage of people’s concern for their health. They should not generally be permitted for prescription drugs or to promote drugs for certain serious conditions that can be treated only by qualified health practitioners, for which certain countries have established lists. To fight drug addiction and dependency, scheduled narcotic and psychotropic drugs should not be advertised to the general public. While health education aimed at children is highly desirable, drug advertisements should not be directed at children. Advertisements may claim that a drug can cure, prevent, or relieve an ailment only if this can be substantiated. They should also indicate, where applicable, appropriate limitations to the use of the drug.”
01	Should People Become Vegetarian?	“In much of the world today, people don’t eat animals because they have to; they eat animals because they choose to. And when eating animals is a choice rather than a necessity, it becomes an ethical and an ideological issue. The unnecessary slaughter and consumption of other sentient beings requires that people act against their core values – such as justice, compassion, and reciprocity – and that they remain unaware of the inconsistency in their values and behaviors. Such widespread ethical inconsistency is only possible within the context of a widespread ideology. Carnism is the invisible ideology that conditions people to eat (certain) animals. Ideologies such as carnism, whose tenets run counter to core human values, maintain themselves by teaching us not to think or feel when we follow their dictates, and they do this by using a set of social and psychological defense mechanisms. ‘Carnistic defenses’ hide the contradictions between our values and behaviors, allowing us to make exceptions to what we would normally consider ethical. Consider how most people in the West (‘inedible’ species change from culture to culture) would feel disgusted eating golden retriever flesh, and yet regularly consume the flesh of pigs, who are equally if not more intelligent than dogs and who – like all sentient beings – have lives that matter to them. Carnistic defenses include invisibility (the ideology and its victims are kept out of public consciousness), the Three Ns of Justification (we learn that eating animals is normal, natural, and necessary – the same myths used to justify other violent ideologies), and cognitive distortions (for instance, we refer to the chicken on our plate as something, rather than someone). For those of us who have the luxury of reflecting on the ethics of our choices, once we step outside the carnistic box it becomes clear that the only logical and ethical choice is vegetarianism.”
10	Has Obamacare Increased Health Insurance Competition? - DEBATED	"""Analyzing insurer participation in both federal and state-run exchanges shows that the President's health care law has almost completely failed to increase insurance market competition...  In the vast majority of states, the number of insurers competing in the state's exchange is actually less than the number of carriers that previously sold individual market policies in the state.  At the local level, in over half of the 3,135 counties in the U.S., consumers will face an exchange market that is either a duopoly or monopoly. In 78 percent of U.S. counties, exchange enrollees will have a choice of coverage from three or fewer carriers.   The exchange market in over 94 percent of U.S. counties will feature competition among five or fewer companies. In Alabama, about 96 percent of that state's counties will have only one insurer offering coverage in the exchange...  By the standards of the President's own 'guiding principle,' his law largely fails. Obamacare's overregulation of insurance is to blame for the lack of competition in the exchanges. The flawed policies contained in Obamacare neither foster competition nor increase consumer choice, and they will continue to negatively impact American consumers and increase costs."""

Some of those who have struggled with same-sex attractions believe that they are called to a celibate life. They should not be made to feel that they have failed to achieve freedom because they do not experience desires for the other sex. Others wish to marry and have children. There is every reason to hope that many will be able, in time, to achieve this goal. They should not, however, be encouraged to rush into marriage since there is ample evidence that marriage is not a cure for same-sex attractions. With the power of grace, the sacraments, support from the community, and an experienced therapist, a determined individual should be able to achieve the inner freedom promised by Christ.”
10	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Today, there can be no dispute that Obamacare is a disaster.  The reason Obamacare is failing is not its bungled website. It is because Americans are now seeing the fundamental trade-off behind the law — that in order to insure a relatively small number of the uninsured, many millions more Americans are likely to lose their private insurance, lose access to preferred doctors, or pay substantially more for their insurance.  President Obama promised that if this law was passed, you could keep your plan, you could keep your doctors, and your premiums would go down. Each of those promises has proved false.  Already, more than 4 million people have lost their insurance plans because of Obamacare. And millions more Americans' health insurance is at risk. Some experts predict anywhere from 80 million to 129 million private health plans will be canceled or forcibly changed over the next year...  The president promised that the average family's premiums would fall by $2,500; instead, they have risen by over $3,000 since 2008...  Moreover, Obamacare is a major jobs killer, especially for those struggling to climb the economic ladder. Workers are seeing their hours cut, and small businesses are unable to hire new employees."""

01	Does Illegal Immigration Disadvantage American Workers?	"""Because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market and because the black American labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there is little doubt that there is significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market. Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers (the highest for all racial and ethnic groups for whom data is collected), it is obvious that the major looser [sic] in this competition are low skilled black workers…   It is not just that the availability of massive numbers of illegal immigrants depress wages, it is the fact that their sheer numbers keep wages from rising over time, and that is the real harm experienced by citizen workers in the low skilled labor market."""

Abortion foes also raised alarms about similar federally subsidized insurance pools being put together in New Mexico and Maryland...

Pennsylvania officials issued a statement on July 15 saying that for any abortions performed because of reasons other than rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life, women 'will have to pay for them out their own pocket.' And New Mexico backed down just as quickly, issuing a July 15 statement saying 'elective abortion is not and has never been intended to be a benefit.'...

10	Would Repealing the 1945 Antitrust Exemption for Health Insurance Companies Lower Premiums? - DEBATED	"""Legislation seeking to amend what is a very limited federal antitrust exemption for the insurance industry under the McCarran-Ferguson Act would likely reduce competition in the industry, resulting in less choice and higher costs for insurance buyers. Here's why...  The limited antitrust exemption under McCarran-Ferguson allows insurers to pool historic loss information so that they are better able to project future losses and charge an actuarially based price for their products. It also allows for joint development of policy forms.  The act does not exempt insurers from state antitrust laws, which explicitly prohibit insurers (and all businesses), from conspiring to fix prices or otherwise restrict competition. The McCarran-Ferguson Act in no way results in any kind of restraint on competition.  Under the act, insurers remain subject to rate and form regulation in every state...  The net effect of the limited exemption under McCarran-Ferguson is actually to increase competition by giving small insurers, who otherwise would have too little data to develop actuarially credible (i.e. statistically reliable) rates, the tools to compete with larger insurers who have much more data on which to base rates."""

Similar to findings from the 2014 survey, most people with ACA-compliant plans say they are satisfied with various elements of their plans, including their choice of providers, copays, premiums, and deductibles. Among those with Marketplace coverage, at least seven in ten say they are 'very' or 'somewhat' satisfied with their plan's choice of primary care providers (75 percent) and hospitals (75 percent), as well as their copays for doctor's visits (73 percent) and prescriptions (70 percent). About two-thirds (64 percent) say they are satisfied with their choice of specialists, while 16 percent are dissatisfied and about one in five (19 percent) say they don't know, likely because they have not tried to use a specialist under their plan. While majorities of Marketplace enrollees say they are satisfied with their premiums and deductibles, substantial shares express dissatisfaction, including 32 percent who say they are dissatisfied with their premium and 36 percent who are dissatisfied with their deductible."""
01	Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?	"""Obamacare means a huge improvement in the quality of life for tens of millions of Americans – not just better care, but greater financial security. And even those who were already insured have gained both security and freedom, because they now have a guarantee of coverage if they lose or change jobs.  What about the costs? Here, too, the news is better than anyone expected. In 2014, premiums on the insurance policies offered through the Obamacare exchanges were well below those originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, and the available data indicates a mix of modest increases and actual reductions for 2015 – which is very good in a sector where premiums normally increase five percent or more each year. More broadly, overall health spending has slowed substantially, with the cost-control features of the ACA probably deserving some of the credit.  In other words, health reform is looking like a major policy success story. It's a program that is coming in ahead of schedule – and below budget – costing less, and doing more to reduce overall health costs than even its supporters predicted…  And this big improvement in American society is almost surely here to stay… Health reform has made America a different, better place."""
10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“Students should learn to make informed decisions about the clothes they wear… Bullying occurs whether students wear uniforms or not. The root cause of bullying should be addressed. Teens should be able to develop self-expression and their personal identity. Instead, they might resort to unconventional piercings and tattoos… [S]chool uniforms encourage followers not leaders. The practice discourages independent thinkers. This follower mentality could extend into adulthood… [T]he push for students to wear uniforms to improve behavior lacks validity and seems ill-advised for a democratic public school system. Today’s school uniforms seem more a punitive measure meant to deny students their right to freedom of expression and individuality. Public schools can still have dress codes without resorting to mandatory uniforms. There are much better goals to address safety and overall school climate.”
10	Should the Pledge of Allegiance Be Removed from the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts?	"""We all agree: 'One nation, under God.' What a beautiful pledge. So rather than address the concerns of the American people, we are making an assault on the Constitution of the United States, which will fail.

10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""Oil provides 95% of the fuel demands of the transportation sector... Every transport mode – cars, trucks, trains, buses, marine vessels, and aircraft – relies almost entirely on petroleum fuels. Only natural gas liquids and, in recent years as the result of regulated fuel mandates, ethanol - have made small inroads in the dominant share held by oil. Further, on the basis of the projections by all major agencies that analyze energy supply and demand trends to 2035 and 2040, this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future...  Proponents of the all-renewable future seem to be stuck in a time warp. For them, it is still 2014, oil prices are still close to $130 per barrel, and natural gas and coal prices are surging. In such a world, it may be easier to make the case that renewables will become far more competitive sooner. The reality, of course, is that the decline of international oil prices to the range of $40 per barrel and the dramatic slumps in natural gas and coal prices in many areas (especially North America), has meant that these hydrocarbons are far better placed to compete with alternative energy sources."""
10	Does Christianity Accept Same-Sex Behavior?	may not have been mentioned by Jesus-many other sexual variations were not, either. But He could not have spelled out the standard for sexual expression more clearly: male to female, joined as God intended them to be. He cannot be assumed to have approved of anything less… Love is not enough to justify a relationship. An unmarried Christian couple may be very much in love; if they become sexually involved before marriage, it will still be sin, no matter how much love went into it. And it will still be wrong. A married man can fall deeply in love with a woman other than his wife; that will never sanctify adultery. Likewise, two men, or women, may be in love. Their love may run very deep, they may pledge fidelity to each other and live as happily as any married heterosexual couple. Again, that will not, of itself, justify a homosexual relationship. Scripture places boundaries on human relationships, offering no compromise, even if love is present and desires to cross those boundaries. If a form of sexual relating is wrong, it remains wrong no matter what degree of love goes along with it.”
10	Should Employers Who Unknowingly Hire Immigrants Who Are in the United States Illegally Receive Lighter Penalties?	"""[E]mployers who unknowingly hire illegal aliens should be penalized.

"""The AccuVote-TSX touch-screen ballot station does not allow a voter to select more than the designated candidates or selections for a specific race, eliminating the opportunity to over-vote.  The AccuVote-TSX touch-screen ballot station offers a summary page to the voter once the voter has sequenced through the entire ballot. The summary page will indicate via a distinct color which races have been under-voted. A touch of the screen on the under-voted race will cause the AccuVote-TSX to return the voter to the under-voted race within the ballot and allow the voter to complete the voting process. A voter can step back and forth through the ballot, changing any selection until the ballot is 'cast.'

10	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“You know I think I know a little about abortion. I was one of the founders of NARAL [Pro-Choice America], the National Abortion Rights Action League in 1969 and for a period of two years I was [the] [d]irector of the largest abortion clinic in the Western world… Since those times we have a science, which is known as Fetology, [which] has allowed us to study the human fetus. And all those studies have concluded without exception that the unborn child is a human being indistinguishable from any of us and an integral part of our human community. In discussing abortion we must also understand that the unborn child is not the only victim. Women themselves are victims, just as the unborn children are… Women in increasing numbers, hundreds, thousands, and even tens of thousands, have had their wombs perforated, infected, destroyed. Women have been sterilized, castrated, all as a result which they have had no true knowledge… Now the destruction of a living human being is no solution to what is basically a social problem. I believe a resort to such violence is an admission of scientific and even worse, ethical impoverishment. Somehow I refuse to believe that Americans, who have put men on the moon can’t devise a better solution than the resort to violence… Let’s all for humanity’s sake, here and now, stop the killing.”
01	Is Drinking Milk the Best Way for People to Incorporate Calcium into Their Diet?	"""The largest source of dietary calcium for most persons is milk and other dairy products, which accounts for 72% of the calcium in the US food supply. Sixty-five percent of the dietary calcium intake in children in the United States is supplied by dairy products. Drinking three 8-oz glasses of milk per day will achieve the recommended adequate intake of calcium in children 4 to 8 years of age, and four 8- to 10-oz glasses of milk will provide the adequate calcium intake for adolescents... It is important to note that there is relatively little difference in the calcium content of reduced-fat dairy products compared with whole milk–derived products...  Most vegetables contain calcium, although at relatively low density. Thus, large servings are needed to equal the total intake achieved with typical servings of dairy products... Calcium supplements are another alternative source, but these products do not offer the benefits of other associated nutrients, and compliance may be a problem."""

I woke up not really knowing where I was and suffering badly from jet lag. It seemed ridiculous to me as I'd been tested just four days earlier, straight after the match I had lost in the Australian Open.  The official who came to my home wanted me to produce identification to prove who I was. He insisted on watching me provide a sample, literally with my trousers round my ankles, and then insisted that I wrote down my own address, even though he was at my private home at 7am.  I may miss a flight or a flight could be delayed, yet I have to let WADA know exactly where I will be, even when I am resting. They even turned up at my hotel in Miami while I was on holiday...

We reviewed the recently finalized research conducted by our colleagues at the National Toxicology Program (NTP), part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences within the National Institutes of Health, on radiofrequency energy exposure. After reviewing the study, we disagree, however, with the conclusions of their final report regarding ‘clear evidence’ of carcinogenic activity in rodents exposed to radiofrequency energy… Based on our ongoing evaluation of this issue, the totality of the available scientific evidence continues to not support adverse health effects in humans caused by exposures at or under the current radiofrequency energy exposure limits. We believe the existing safety limits for cell phones remain acceptable for protecting the public health.”
10	Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?	"""American society has never sanctioned assisted suicide or mercy killing. We believe that the practices would be profoundly dangerous for large segments of the population, especially in light of the widespread failure of American medicine to treat pain adequately or to diagnose and treat depression in many cases. The risks would extend to all individuals who are ill. They would be most severe for those whose autonomy and well-being are already compromised by poverty, lack of access to good medical care, or membership in a stigmatized social group. The risks of legalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia for these individuals, in a health care system and society that cannot effectively protect against the impact of inadequate resources and ingrained social disadvantage, are likely to be extraordinary."""
10	Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?	"""America's insatiable appetite for the good things energy delivers could not be satisfied by fossil fuels alone. Hydroelectric power, a renewable source of energy created by the damming of rapidly-flowing rivers, was introduced in the 1890s, as was nuclear power in the late 1950s. In recent years, other renewable sources of energy – wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal – have entered the fray. However, while the use of renewable fuels is expected to increase in the years to come, their overall contribution to America's energy pool is forecast by the EIA [US Energy Information Agency] to remain very modest, far behind fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Nuclear power, by contrast, which currently supplies about 20 percent of US electricity, is expected to become a more prominent player as a new generation of power plants go into service in the decades to come."""

01	Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?	"A right to health care could improve public health.

10	Should the Death Penalty Be Used for Retribution?	"""What justification can there be for capital punishment at all? The two main arguments for the death penalty are deterrence and retribution. Few experts believe that the threat of capital punishment is an effective deterrent. That leaves retribution. But to justify capital punishment, the retribution must be meted out fairly, and that is clearly not the case. In only 1% of murders do prosecutors seek the death penalty.

01	Is There a Connection between Sexual Orientation and the Ratio between Second and Fourth Finger Length?	women, the index finger (2D, second digit) is almost the same length as the fourth digit (4D), although it may be slightly longer or shorter; in men, the index finger is more often shorter than the fourth. The greater 2D:4D ratio in females is established in two-year-olds. Because all non-gonadal somatic sex differences in humans appear to be the result of fetal androgens that masculinize males, the sex difference in the 2D:4D ratio probably reflects the prenatal influence of androgenon males… The right-hand 2D:4D ratio of homosexual women was significantly more masculine (that is, smaller) than that of heterosexual women, and did not differ significantly from that of heterosexual men.”
01	Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?	“Unfortunately, however, not all animal research can be replaced by animal free experiments. One reason is that there are no alternative methods that can mimic the whole human body. For instance, studying how cancer spreads from one part of the body to another is impossible with current alternatives. Actually, to study any process that involves more than one organ requires the use of an animal, as the interaction that takes place between different organs is very complex. Up till now it is impossible to replicate this in a cell culture dish… [T]here’s no doubt that the work to reduce the use of animals in research is something that needs to be further addressed, and hopefully we will be able to find adequate alternatives for all kinds of research. But until we reach that stage, medical progress is not possible without exploiting animals.”
10	Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?	Lowering the corporate tax rate raises the deficit, which hurts job creation and wages. A lower federal corporate tax rate means less government tax revenue, thus reducing federal programs, investments, and job-creating opportunities. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top marginal rate from 46% to 34%, the federal deficit increased from $149.7 billion to $255 billion from 1987-1993.

There is a one-word explanation: money. In a letter to ACLU supporters, its chief writes, ‘The ACLU was recently notified that our largest individual donor… will not be able to continue his support due to a change in his financial circumstances.’ Thus, the ACLU is deprived of the money with which to mount its usual spate of threats and lawsuits against towns that have the temerity to have Christmas parades or Nativity scenes. Many of the latter have been accompanied in recent years by symbols of other religions, too, but that makes no difference to the ACLU. It’s Christianity they’re after… As is well known, Santa keeps a list of who has been naughty and nice during the year. On good authority we have been told that, despite its current penurious condition, the ACLU is still on the Naughty list and will get a lump of coal again this Christmas.”
10	Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?	“The core of Reagan’s strength had been the public’s perception that he was a man of his beliefs: he might compromise on the margins, but he would not sell out his principles wholesale. The shipments of weapons to Khomeini shook the foundations of this belief, squandering Reagan’s moral authority… His was a rhetorical presidency, capable at its best of uniting the country behind a common vision and moving the political center a long step to the right. But the Iran-contra affair revealed his rhetoric to be disconnected from his actions, and his actions to be disconnected from his policies. Ronald Reagan’s talents had hidden his flaws too well; inevitably his unmasking was his unmaking.”
10	Is Obamacare Decreasing the Federal Deficit? - DEBATED	"""A report issued in February at my request by the Government Accountability Office revealed that under a realistic set of assumptions the health care law is projected to increase the federal deficit by 0.7% of GDP over the next 75 years, an amount that is equivalent to $6.2 trillion in today's dollars. This estimate excludes debt service costs. This is an enormous sum...  This report is crucial. It clearly answered the question. It sank any validity to the President's claim that his plan would not add 'one dime to our deficits, now or anytime in the future, period'...  So, despite what we were told by proponents of this law, the truth is the President's health care law will further increase the cost of health care, add to our already unsustainable deficits and debt.""  [Editor's Note: The ""February"" Government Accountability Office (GAO) report referenced in the above quote by Senator Jeff Sessions is the Jan. 31, 2013 GAO report referenced in our chart and general reference quote at the top of this page.

Senator Sessions requested that the GAO prepare both a baseline scenario and an alternative scenario which assumed various cost containment provisions in Obamacare would be eliminated by Congress over time including productivity adjustments for Medicare payments, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The GAO's baseline report found that Obamacare would decrease the federal deficit by 1.5% of GDP over 75 years while the alternative scenario report found Obamacare would increase the federal deficit by 0.7% over 75 years.]"

01	"Should the Term ""Illegal Alien"" Be Used to Define Persons in Violation of Immigration Law?"	"""The correct terminology for the nearly 20 million persons illegally in the U.S. is illegal aliens. The term undocumented immigrants is purposely incorrect in order to sway the public in favor of special interest groups and only clouds the reality of the situation. Most undocumented border crossers never had a document to lose. The incorrect and understated implication is that legal status can be achieved merely by completing some paperwork. By law the illegal alien must leave the country in order to apply through the proper immigration procedure...  An alien is a person who comes from a foreign country. The term illegal alien is broader and more accurate because it includes undocumented aliens and nonimmigrant visa overstayers. An undocumented alien is an individual who has entered the U.S. illegally, without entry documentation. Any alien who violates the terms of his or her admission may be deemed to be out of status. Becoming out of status occurs when a nonimmigrant remains in the United States beyond the expiration date of their visa or when a nonimmigrant engages in employment in the United States for which she is not authorized. Roughly 60% of the illegal alien population are undocumented aliens and about 40% are nonimmigrant visa overstayers. Thus, the term illegal alien, being broader in scope, is the accurate term to use."""

01	Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?	“As business owners and executives, we support gradually raising the federal minimum wage to at least $12 by 2020. It’s good for business, customers and our economy. Today’s outdated minimum wage has far less buying power than it had in the 1960s. Stuck since 2009 at $7.25 an hour – just $15,080 a year – the minimum wage impoverishes working families and weakens the consumer spending at the heart of our economy. Raising the minimum wage makes good business sense. Workers are also customers. Minimum wage increases boost sales at local businesses as workers buy goods and services they could not afford before. And nothing drives job creation more than consumer demand. Businesses also see cost savings from lower employee turnover and benefit from increased productivity, product quality and customer satisfaction. The most rigorous studies of the impact of actual minimum wage increases show they do not cause job loss. Raising the minimum wage will keep more dollars circulating in our local economy and reduce the growing strain on our social safety net caused by inadequate wages.”

In a matter of months, the thousand or so apprehensions of unaccompanied juveniles we'd previously been seeing every year surged into the tens of thousands.   A year later, the surge reached the hundreds of thousands (not including an equal jump in 'family units')…  Now, thanks to DACA, taxpayers spend hundreds of millions annually to reunite the (mostly) uneducated minors with their (mostly) illegal alien parents in the U.S. That's money that should have gone to support schools, hospitals, and job-training for American youth."""
01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""It would be much easier to eliminate the anti-doping rules than to eliminate doping. The current policy against doping has proved expensive and difficult to police. In the near future it may become impossible to police...  Because doping is illegal, the pressure is to make performance enhancers undetectable, rather than safe. Performance enhancers are produced or bought on the black market and administered in a clandestine, uncontrolled way with no monitoring of the athlete's health. Allowing the use of performance enhancers would make sport safer as there would be less pressure on athletes to take unsafe enhancers and a pressure to develop new safe performance enhancers and to make existing enhancers more effective at safe dosages...  The removal of doping controls would have major benefits: less cheating, increased solidarity and respect between athletes, more focus on sport and not on rules."""
01	Can a Child’s Relationship with His or Her Parents Cause Homosexuality?	following is one of the many developmental pathways that can lead to homosexuality, but a common one… [The boy] recalls a painful ‘mismatch’ between what he needed and longed for and what his father offered him. Perhaps most people would agree that his father was distinctly distant and ineffective… The absence of a happy, warm, and intimate closeness with his father led to the boy’s pulling away in disappointment, ‘defensively detaching’ in order to protect himself… Although he has ‘defensively detached’ from his father, the young boy still carries silently within him a terrible longing for the warmth, love, and encircling arms of the father he never had nor could have… When puberty sets in, sexual urges – which can attach themselves to any object, especially in males – rise to the surface and combine with this already intense need for masculine intimacy and warmth. He begins to develop homosexual crushes… As he matures (especially in our culture where early, extramarital sexual experiences are sanctioned and even encouraged), the youngster, now a teen, being to experiment with homosexual activity… At some point, he gives in to his deep longings for love and begins to have voluntary homosexual experiences.”
10	Do Standardized Tests Improve Education in America?	“[W]e have piled on a lot of standardized tests on our kids… Too often what we’ve been doing is using these tests to punish students or to, in some cases, punish schools. …[O]ne thing I never want to see happen is schools that are just teaching to the test. Because then you’re not learning about the world; you’re not learning about different cultures, you’re not learning about science, you’re not learning about math. All you’re learning about is how to fill out a little bubble on an exam and the little tricks that you need to do in order to take a test. And that’s not going to make education interesting to you. And young people do well in stuff that they’re interested in. They’re not going to do as well if it’s boring.”
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	"Violent video games allow players to release their stress and anger (catharsis) in the game, leading to less real world aggression. A peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that children, especially boys, play video games as a means of managing their emotions: ""61.9% of boys played to 'help me relax,' 47.8% because 'it helps me forget my problems,' and 45.4% because 'it helps me get my anger out."" [37] Researchers point to the cathartic effect of video games as a possible reason for why higher game sales have been associated with lower crime rates. [84] A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Adolescent Research concluded that ""Boys use games to experience fantasies of power and fame, to explore and master what they perceive as exciting and realistic environments (but distinct from real life), to work through angry feelings or relieve stress, and as social tools.""[36] The games serve as a substitute for rough-and-tumble play.

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“We need a comprehensive approach: a surge in mental health services, mental health ‘first aid’ programs to identify and intervene in problems before it’s too late, and a background check system that will stop the most dangerous among us from buying guns, by getting records in the system and closing the Internet and gun-show loopholes… We have done our homework, and the numbers don’t lie: From Texas to New Hampshire and everywhere in between, we know that support for policies such as expanded background checks continue to be popular in both parties. Gun owners and non-gun owners alike agree on expanding background checks, making gun trafficking a serious crime with stiff penalties, making it illegal for all stalkers and all domestic abusers to buy guns, and expanding mental health resources so the mentally ill find it easier to receive treatment than to buy firearms.”
01	Should Abortion Be Legal?	“Nothing made me more pro-choice than being a parent. To force someone to be a parent against their will when we know how hard it is already for people who want to be parents is just wrong. Before I had my abortion, I think like most Americans, I had presumed that should I ever face that decision, that service would be available to me — and it was. And like most Americans, I was grateful it was available to me — and then I moved on. I didn’t become an activist around reproductive rights as a result of my own abortion, but because doing human rights work around the world showed me that when women have access to family planning and can have a seat at the table, we can have change — and for the better. Forcing women to have children against their will became synonymous to me with the idea of patriarchy, someone saying that I would always be lesser than.”

01	The Electoral College: Top 3 Pros and Cons	"The Founding Fathers enshrined the Electoral College in the US Constitution because they thought it was the best method to choose the president. Using electors instead of the popular vote was intended to safeguard against uninformed or uneducated voters by putting the final decision in the hands of electors most likely to possess the information necessary to make the best decision; to prevent states with larger populations from having undue influence; and to compromise between electing the president by popular vote and letting Congress choose the president. [7] [8] [9] According to Alexander Hamilton, the Electoral College is if ""not perfect, it is at least excellent,"" because it ensured ""that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications."" [7] The Founders wanted to balance the will of the populace against the risk of ""tyranny of the majority,"" in which the voices of the masses can drown out minority interests. [10]"

10	Has Obamacare Improved Medicaid? - DEBATED	"""The Affordable Care Act allows states to add another category to Medicaid: able-bodied adults, many of whom are without children. The ACA also provides much higher federal funding–as compared to the funding for traditional groups (like moms and kids and the disabled)–to entice the states to expand their program to these able-bodied adults...  But these short-term coverage gains will soon be overshadowed by the longer-term challenges that continue to plague the program and are likely to be exacerbated by the ACA...  There have been numerous academic studies that have exposed the fact that Medicaid patients have worse access and outcomes than privately insured patients. For example, a 2003 study found that health outcomes for colorectal, lung, prostate and breast cancer in Kentucky were higher for privately insured than those on Medicaid. A 2010 study found similar results for non-cancer-related illnesses...  Medicaid needs reform, not expansion. Medicaid has its place in providing a safety net. But, it should be a secure safety net, not one filled with holes and patches. Policymakers and advocates for the poor should also begin to think about better ways to serve the poor."""

01	Should Physicians Participate in Executions?	"""We expect physicians to offer comfort care to the dying, even if the treatment, like morphine to dampen end-stage cancer pain, will inevitably hasten death. These physicians are not killing their patients; they are comforting them in their final moments of life...  Death row inmates have certain parallels to dying patients. Death is coming. A physician can do nothing to change that. All that can be offered is professional care during the final moments of life. And that should be of comfort to the condemned...  The idea that physicians may participate in executions does not mean that they must do so. But it should be an option for those who believe that they have a duty to ease suffering and that this duty includes caring for those who will die at the hands of the state...  Physician involvement in lethal injection can make capital punishment less grotesque, more palatable, and even routine. But so long as the state uses the tools of the physician to kill its citizens, those who wish to step in to ensure that executions are, at the very least, competently handled should have the option to do so. Anything else is death penalty politics at the expense of the condemned. And no matter where you come out on capital punishment, no one should be sentenced to a botched execution."""

L&A testing increases the confidence that the system properly attributes votes and that the tally will be repeated exactly the same way each time the system is voted.  Logic and Accuracy testing confirms that each candidate appears in the proper precinct, including split precincts, and does not appear in precincts outside that candidate's jurisdiction.

01	Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?	“The worst consequence of the marijuana black market is that the safety of our children is imperiled. A black marketer will sell marijuana to our children. A licensed and tax-paying retailer will not. They will not jeopardize their livelihood. This proof, and other proof readily available from the Colorado Health Department’s website, clearly shows that teen marijuana use dips after legalization and that Colorado youths obtain 3 percent of their marijuana from a family member and 2 percent of it with their own MMJ card. That implies that 95 percent of their marijuana is coming from the black market. And a black marketer sells other drugs, too. Inevitably, a customer requesting his usual ounce of pot will instead be offered heroin or meth. A legal and licensed business, by contrast, will always provide the requested product. When was the last time you went to a liquor store and were told they were out of beer but how about some opioids? Let’s be absolutely honest: The gateway to other drugs is not marijuana, it’s prohibition.”

10	Should Hydrogen (vs. Electricity) Be the Dominant Energy in the US?	"""The idea of a hydrogen economy has burst like a supernova over the energy policy landscape, mesmerizing us with its possibilities while blinding us to its weaknesses. Such a fierce spotlight on hydrogen is pushing more promising strategies into the shadows...

The most important of these is the successful commercialization of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)...  [H]ydrogen's high cost, poor energetics and scant environmental benefits for the near and medium term future must be taken into account when evaluating it against alternative fuels and strategies...  For a hydrogen economy to have any impact the nation must change virtually every aspect of its energy system, from production to distribution...  The electricity network is already in place. Why not focus on expanding the portion of this delivery system that relies on renewable energy rather than spend the next generation creating a new delivery infrastructure [for hydrogen]...  This is the time to make a major effort to move solar energy from the margins of energy production to its center rather than to shift our intellectual and scientific and capital resources toward constructing the infrastructure demanded for a hydrogen economy and end up 25 years from now where we are, in essence today: having 2 percent of the hydrogen market and hoping to increase that fraction."""
01	Does Marijuana Use Increase the Risk of Psychosis (Including Schizophrenia)?	aimed to investigate how frequent use of skunk-like (high-potency) cannabis in south London affected the association between cannabis and psychotic disorders… Compared with those who never used cannabis, individuals who mostly used skunk-like cannabis were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with a psychotic disorder if they used it less than once per week… almost three times as likely if they used it at weekends… and more than five times as likely if they were daily users… The association between cannabis use and increased risk of developing schizophrenia-like psychosis has been consistently reported by prospective epidemiological studies. Our previous study was the first to show that use of high-potency (skunk-like) cannabis carries the highest risk for psychotic disorders. In the present larger sample analysis, we replicated our previous report and showed that the highest probability to suffer a psychotic disorder is in those who are daily users of high potency cannabis. Indeed, skunk use appears to contribute to 24% of cases of first episode psychosis in south London.”

10	Are Fewer People Relying on Emergency Rooms for Health Care Under Obamacare? - DEBATED	"""Obamacare's individual mandate doesn't allow people to buy inexpensive insurance focused on emergency care: instead, it forces people to buy comprehensive insurance packages with a generous list of basic benefits, benefits far exceeding those required to address the issue of uncompensated emergency room care...  It's pretty simple: if your health care is paid for, you are more likely to see the doctor more, and consume more tests and procedures, than if you are uninsured. Hence, people with insurance consume, on average, twice as much health care as do the uninsured.

01	Should the US Use Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) to Extract Natural Gas?	"""The U.S. is in the midst of an energy revolution, and we don't mean solar panels or wind turbines. A new gusher of natural gas from shale has the potential to transform U.S. energy production—that is, unless politicians, greens and the industry mess it up...  The resulting boom is transforming America's energy landscape. As recently as 2000, shale gas was 1% of America's gas supplies; today it is 25%. Prior to the shale breakthrough, U.S. natural gas reserves were in decline, prices exceeded $15 per million British thermal units, and investors were building ports to import liquid natural gas. Today, proven reserves are the highest since 1971, prices have fallen close to $4 and ports are being retrofitted for LNG exports.  The shale boom is also reviving economically suffering parts of the country, while offering a new incentive for manufacturers to stay in the U.S....  The question... is whether we are serious about domestic energy production. All forms of energy have risks and environmental costs, not least wind (noise and dead birds and bats) and solar (vast expanses of land). Yet renewables are nowhere close to supplying enough energy, even with large subsidies, to maintain America's standard of living. The shale gas and oil boom is the result of U.S. business innovation and risk-taking. If we let the fear of undocumented pollution kill this boom, we will deserve our fate as a second-class industrial power."""

10	Is Raw Milk More Healthful Than Pasteurized Milk?	"""Unlike milk you buy at the supermarket, raw milk isn't pasteurized. When milk is pasteurized, it's heated to 161°F for just 20 seconds. While that doesn't affect milk's nutritional value, it does kill off disease-causing bacteria such as Listeria, Salmonella and E. coli. Illnesses caused by these bacteria can range from diarrhea and vomiting to paralysis, kidney failure and stroke.  Even if raw milk comes from a small, local or organic farm, it's not necessarily safe. The most hygienic dairy farms are still breeding grounds for bacteria that thrive on cow's skin, as well as dirt, rodents and feces. When even the smallest amounts of bacteria from these sources pass into milk, they quickly grow and multiply, so laboratory tests can't always detect them. And you can't tell if milk is contaminated by drinking, smelling or sipping it either.  When it comes to dairy, a little processing is a good thing. Stick with pasteurized milk and stay safe."""

10	Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?	"""The fact is: the drinking of cow milk has been linked to iron-deficiency anemia in infants and children; it has been named as the cause of cramps and diarrhea in much of the world's population, and the cause of multiple forms of allergy as well; and the possibility has been raised that it may play a central role in the origins of atherosclerosis and heart attacks...  In no mammalian species, except for the human (and the domestic cat), is milk consumption continued after the weaning period [the period of breast-feeding]. Calves thrive on cow milk. Cow milk is for calves.  In many other parts of the world, most particularly in East Asia, Africa, and South America, people regard cow milk as unfit for consumption by adult human beings."""

01	Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?	"""With reference to performance-enhancing drugs, if we have discarded the useless 'unfair advantage' argument because of an unbiased look at the inherently technologically unfair nature of professional sport, we are really only left with worries about harm to athletes. Please note: harm to athletes, not breast augmentation patients, Viagra users or the spaced-out Ritalin generation. We don't worry when the Isle of Man TT race or the Vendee Globe claims another life, or when that boxer on the news gets Alzheimer's. And when innocent Canadian soldiers are shot by American pilots buzzing on Army-sanctioned ephedrine, we're still convinced that sport is somehow exempt from the influence of the natural human desire for constant improvement.  The rationalization is that it is okay for pilots to take performance-enhancing drugs, for musicians to use Beta blockers and for our children to swallow Ritalin because performance is paramount. But where are our health concerns now? Perversely, we deny the 'performance is paramount' principle in professional sport while citing health concerns about performance-enhancing drugs. We want better performances from our sports heroes all the time, but demonize the methods used to produce such performances while hiding behind concerns for health that are not commensurate with our normal paternalistic attitudes."""

10	Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?	“The appeal of school uniforms is based less on the likelihood of realizing any long-term benefits than on the nostalgic yearning for a simpler and less dangerous age. To imagine that telling students what to wear will bring back those days is to engage in wishful, if not fuzzy, thinking… If we want students to grow into critical thinkers and ethical people, then we have to aim higher than mere conformity. Children, after all, learn how to make good decisions by making decisions, not by following directions. If we want them to take responsibility for their behavior, then we have to give them responsibilities… Thus, if T-shirts contain slogans that offend us, or gang colors threaten to be inflammatory, school administrators might invite students to participate in analyzing the problem and constructing a solution. Apart from being more respectful, this approach is also more effective over the long run (and better preparation for life in a democratic society), than issuing a decree (‘Wear this’)… Is it even reasonable to expect uniforms to solve the problems for which they are recommended? Can violence be reduced by borrowing an idea from the military?… Complex problems will not disappear just because we demand that students wear what we tell them. Relying on power to induce conformity rarely produces lasting solutions.”

For large municipalities, rigorously enforcing immigration law is unfeasible but also politically unpopular. So-called 'sanctuary cities' have declared their ongoing intention to drag their feet when it comes to cooperating with the Feds. For example, law enforcement in many cities (including New York) selectively complies with ICE requests to hold people in custody on suspicion of being undocumented. ICE can't do their job without local cooperation and the use of these legally questionable detention orders has decreased by more than 70 percent in the last four years."""

10	Is Drinking Milk a Good Way to Build Strong Bones?	"""There is much debate over whether long-term consumption of dairy products helps bones at all. A good deal of evidence suggests that it does not. Several studies of teenagers have found that their adult bone health is related to their physical activity level earlier in life, but not to the amount of milk or calcium they consumed. Milk consumption is apparently no help later in life either. In a 12-year Harvard study(1.49 MB)  of 78,000 women, those who got the most calcium from dairy products received no benefit and actually broke more bones than the women who got little or no calcium from dairy. Similarly, a 1994 study of elderly men and women in Sydney, Australia, showed that those who consumed the most dairy products had double the hip fracture rate of those who consumed the least.   These findings indicate that despite the amount of calcium in dairy products, other dairy compounds accelerate calcium loss. Animal proteins and salt are two likely suspects."""

01	Should the United States Return to a Gold Standard?	Returning to a gold standard would stabilize the price of oil and help slow the rise in gasoline prices. Since leaving the gold standard in 1971, inflation has reduced the value of the dollar, and inflated the price of oil about 32 fold. [17] In 1973, Saudi Arabia (and in 1975 all OPEC nations) agreed to trade oil only in dollars. [16] This created a new international demand for the fiat dollars the Fed was now printing and as more dollars flooded the world, general inflation (as well as spikes and collapses) in oil prices followed. [18] When on a partial gold standard in the 1950s and 1960s the nominal price of oil was stable, averaging $2.90 a barrel. By June 2008 the nominal price of oil hit $126.33 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, a barrel of oil cost $20 in 1971 – it now costs close to $100. [19] According to Charles Kadlec, founder of Community of Liberty and Forbes contributor, if the gold standard had been maintained the price of gasoline today would likely be about $1.00 a gallon.

The smallest employers are not only exempt from any potential fine for not providing insurance, if they do or want to provide insurance to employees, they can get tax credits to help do that. That's in effect now for companies with few than 25 employees and wages below $50,000 each. If they offer insurance and pay at least half the premiums, they can receive a tax credit of up to 35 percent of their contributions. After 2014, the tax credit goes up to 50 percent if the business buys coverage through the insurance exchange. Companies that have up to 50 employees and who do not provide health care benefits are not subject to any fines for not providing that coverage. Their employees will be able to get their coverage in the health exchanges the law creates starting in 2014.

Therefore, CBO and JCT effectively estimated in February [2011] that PPACA and the health-related provisions of the Reconciliation Act will produce a net decrease in federal deficits of $210 billion over the 2012–2021 period...  The difference between the two estimates is primarily attributable to the different time periods they cover...  Over the eight years that are common to the two analyses—2012 to 2019—enactment of PPACA and the health-related provisions of the Reconciliation Act was projected last March to reduce federal deficits by $132 billion, whereas the February 2011 estimate shows that those provisions will reduce deficits by an estimated $119 billion...

Indeed, the prevalence of motorcycle riding among people who have never ridden a bicycle is probably extremely low.

01	Should Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Technology Be Developed?	"""In order to achieve substantial GHG reductions, geological storage needs to be deployed at a large scale...  A number of geological reservoirs appear to have the potential to store many 100's – 1000's of gigatons of CO2. The most promising reservoirs are porous and permeable rock bodies, generally at depths, roughly 1 km, at pressures and temperatures where CO2 would be in a supercritical phase...  Once in the pore, over a period of tens to hundreds of years, the CO2 will dissolve into other pore fluids, including hydrocarbon species (oil and gas) or brines, where the CO2 is fixed indefinitely, unless other processes intervene. Over longer time scales (hundreds to thousands of years) the dissolved CO2 may react with minerals in the rock volume to precipitate the CO2 as new carbonate minerals...  [I]t is very likely that the fraction of stored CO2 will be greater than 99% over 100 years, and likely that the fraction of stored CO2 will exceed 99% for 1000 years...  Since CO2 is buoyant in most geological settings, it will seek the earth's surface. Therefore, despite the fact that the crust is generally well configured to store CO2, there is the possibility of leakage from storage sites. Leakage of CO2 would negate some of the benefits of sequestration. If the leak is into a contained environment, CO2 may accumulate in high enough concentrations to cause adverse health, safety, and environmental consequences. For any subsurface injected fluid, there is also the concern for the safety of drinking water. Based on analogous experience... these risks appear small...  Our overall judgment is that the prospect for geological CO2 sequestration is excellent. We base this judgment on 30 years of injection experience and the ability of the earth's crust to trap CO2...

There are no phones, no internet, no ATMs, no refrigeration, no sewage pumps – nothing, and if a large city like London is without power for more than 12 hours rioting and looting would quickly take hold. It is therefore inconceivable not to ensure that we have reliable energy at all times. So an energy plan for the UK must be able to meet demand even on the coldest evening of the year in winter with no wind and no solar. For this reason Renewable energy can never under any realistic scenario meet that target. To imagine that battery prices could fall enough to make wind and solar backup such enormous power demands is simply a delusion."""
10	Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?	“I’m a liberal Democrat. And I do not favor same-sex marriage. Do those positions sound contradictory? To me, they fit together… All our scholarly instruments seem to agree: For healthy development, what a child needs more than anything else is the mother and father who together made the child, who love the child and love each other… Because I also believe with all my heart in the right of the child to the mother and father who made her, I believe that we as a society should seek to maintain and to strengthen the only human institution – marriage – that is specifically intended to safeguard that right and make it real for our children. Legalized same-sex marriage almost certainly benefits those same-sex couples who choose to marry, as well as the children being raised in those homes. But changing the meaning of marriage to accommodate homosexual orientation further and perhaps definitively undermines for all of us the very thing – the gift, the birthright – that is marriage’s most distinctive contribution to human society. That’s a change that, in the final analysis, I cannot support.” [Editor’s Note: After David Blankenhorn’s Sep. 19, 2008 Con statement above, he made a Pro statement on June 22, 2012.]

"""Most police officers understand that arresting hookers simply pushes them from place to place so they leave them alone as long as there are no complaints. The prostitutes know this and try to keep a low profile by never working in groups and by sticking to streets where there are few residents. As a result, a parliamentary report concluded a few years ago, most major cities now have 'unofficial zones of tolerance.'   Unfortunately, such zones force streetwalkers to work under the most dangerous conditions possible: alone, on dark, deserted streets...   Amsterdam's red-light district is entirely different... In the red-light district [of Amsterdam], the police are so 'in the middle' that they probably know more about its streets than any other neighbourhood in the city. Officers are always walking around, smiling, chatting and watching. They talk to the brothel owners. They talk to the prostitutes... The police know pretty much what everybody is up to...  It seems to work. For all the district's weirdness and hordes of inebriated tourists, it's remarkably orderly. Even in the late hours of the night, the streets are safer than in the downtown cores of most major cities. When I asked one American if he felt secure here, he burst out laughing.

01	Is Marijuana an Effective Treatment for Reducing Nausea and Vomiting from Chemotherapy?	goal of antiemetic medications is to prevent nausea and vomiting. Hence, antiemetics are typically given before chemotherapy, in which case a pill is an effective form or drug delivery. However, in patients already experiencing severe nausea or vomiting, pills are generally ineffective because of the difficulty in swallowing or keeping a pill down and slow onset of the drug effect. Thus, an inhalation (but preferably not smoking) cannabinoid drug delivery system would be advantageous for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea… It is possible that the harmful effects of smoking marijuana for a limited period of time might be outweighed by the antiemetic benefits of marijuana, at least for patients for whom standard antiemetic therapy is ineffective and who suffer from debilitating emesis.”
10	Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?	“Since 1993, I have headed the WTR [wireless technology research] surveillance and research program funded by the wireless industry.

This past February, at the annual convention of the CTIA, I met with the full board of that organization to brief them on some surprising findings from our work… The rate of death from brain cancer among handheld phone users was higher than the rate of brain cancer death among those who used non-handheld phones that were away from their head; The risk of acoustic neuroma, a benign tumour of the auditory nerve that is well in range of the radiation coming from a phone’s antenna, was fifty percent higher in people who reported using cell phones for six years or more… Today, I sit here extremely frustrated and concerned that appropriate steps have not been taken by the wireless industry to protect consumers… Alarmingly, indications are that some segments of the industry have ignored the scientific findings suggesting potential health effects, have repeatedly and falsely claimed that wireless phones are safe for all consumers including children, and have created an illusion of responsible follow up by calling for and supporting more research.”

[9] As FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly states ""periods without net neutrality rules were times of innovation and investment."" [12] According to economist John W. Mayo, the entire rationale for net neutrality ignores the ""positive economic outcomes in the provision of internet services that resulted from twenty years of light-touch regulation.""

01	Are DACA and the DREAM Act Good for America?	"""Is cancelling DACA the worst single decision Trump has made? In terms of immediate human suffering and sheer moral obtuseness, yes. The Dreamers trusted the federal government with their personal information, including fingerprints and addresses. Their status was always temporary—they had to apply for renewal every two years—but they were assured that their information would not be used against them. Dreamers were able to get Social Security numbers and driver's licenses, go to college, work, buy cars and homes, start businesses. In a recent survey, ninety-one per cent were employed, and forty-five per cent were enrolled in classes. Many have no memory of the countries in which they were born. They are, in a word, Americans. But six months from now, and possibly sooner, they will begin losing their work permits, their places in college, their businesses, their legal right to be in this country. They will start living in fear of deportation. The cruelty of it is staggering…  The truth is that the U.S. economy needs immigrants, including those who are currently undocumented. In Houston, contractors rebuilding the city following Hurricane Harvey say that their work will be slowed by a labor shortage, made worse by the reluctance of undocumented workers to show their faces while the state’s Republican leadership is on the political warpath against sanctuary cities. The workforce that rebuilt New Orleans after Katrina is estimated to have been twenty-five per cent undocumented. Native-born Americans are an aging population; we need young immigrants to keep things ticking. But the question of the treatment of Dreamers is, in the end, an ethical one. What kind of people are we? How do we treat the strangers at our door? The Dreamers aren't even strangers. We've known them almost all their lives."""

Hardly any. That person is paying rent, ideally going out to get subsistence groceries at Safeway, and, if really lucky, has a bus pass. But she’s not going out to eat at restaurants. Not browsing for new clothes. Not buying flowers on Mother’s Day… If people are getting $15 an hour or more, they don’t need food stamps. They don’t need rent assistance. They don’t need you and me to pay for their medical care. If the consumer middle class is back, buying and shopping, then it stands to reason you won’t need as large a welfare state. And at the same time, revenues from payroll and sales taxes would rise, reducing the deficit.”

Innovation policy is, of course, fundamental to the economic growth of a large developed economy like the United States. It supplies the ‘extra ingredient’ necessary to complement capital and labor, which is why numerous respected studies have labeled it fundamental to increased productivity and, therefore, to the ability of a nation to host start-up businesses and create new jobs… Lowering the corporate tax rate will allow such companies to put more capital to work, leading to additional capital investment and greater productivity.

There's not a lot of ambiguity there. If a naturopathic physician is excluded from participating in insurance just because she's a naturopathic physician, that's not permissible. That's the clear meaning of the law, and we know from numerous discussions with Sen. Tom Harkin, the sponsor of the provision, that that's exactly what was intended.   Unfortunately, anybody who's familiar with how laws get implemented knows that it's never that straightforward.

10	Should Social Security Be Privatized?	“AARP strongly opposes these proposals [to divert Social Security payroll taxes to private accounts]. Private accounts in place of Social Security are risky, expensive to administer, and require huge increases in the federal debt. AARP believes there are better and more responsible ways to strengthen the system. To compensate for the loss of Social Security revenue sent into private accounts, the federal government would have to borrow significant sums for the next several decades in order to continue to pay promised benefits to currently retiring beneficiaries. One prominent proposal would require $1 billion in the first 10 years the private accounts were in place. Then, $3.5 trillion would be needed in the following decade. Younger workers would have to bear much of the burden for paying this debt. That’s not right, and it’s not fair to them. Social Security is an insurance program, not an investment program. The essence of Social Security is that it has always been risk-free for all of us. It’s also inflation-proof – something neither investments, nor even many pensions, can guarantee. Private accounts within Social Security would add a large measure of personal risk. AARP has publicly stated many times that there are places in retirement planning that are appropriate for taking risks, such as 401(k) plans, Individual Retirement Accounts, and mutual funds, but they should be in addition to the guarantee of Social Security.”

It can only have two — it can only be both Jewish and democratic by giving up the land on which a Palestinian state can be built in exchange for peace.  For too long, pro-Israel advocacy has defined this conflict in zero-sum terms, as 'us versus them,' a conflict in which there can be only one winner. But being pro-Israel doesn't require an 'anti.'

This scenario severely damages any characterization of him as the role model for character.

The reason solar-power generation will increasingly dominate: it's a technology, not a fuel. As such, efficiency increases and prices fall as time goes on. The price of Earth's limited fossil fuels tends to go the other direction."""
10	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	"Gun control laws, especially those that try to ban “assault weapons,” infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport. In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. [65][66] High-powered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. [67] According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, ""So-called 'Assault weapons' are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term 'assault weapon' was conjured up by anti-gun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie… [T]he Colt AR-15 and Springfield M1A, both labeled 'assault weapons,' are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers, useful for game up to and including deer.""

01	Is Qualification Testing Conducted by Independent and Accredited Entities?	"""Under HAVA, NIST is directed to offer formal accreditation to laboratories that test voting system hardware and software for conformance to the current Voting System Standards. This week, NIST is announcing in the Federal Register the establishment of a Laboratory Accreditation Program for Voting Systems. NIST will carry out the accreditation of these laboratories through the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), which is administered by NIST. NVLAP is a long-established laboratory accreditation program that is recognized both nationally and internationally. NVLAP accreditation criteria are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR, Title 15, Part 285).  Laboratory accreditation thus provides a means of evaluating the competence of laboratories to perform specific types of testing, measurement, and calibration. It also allows a laboratory to determine whether it is performing its work correctly and to appropriate standards. Laboratories seeking accreditation to test voting system hardware and software will be required to meet the NVLAP criteria for accreditation which include: ISO/IEC 17025 [international standard of laboratory competence], the 2002 Voting System Standards, and any other criteria deemed necessary by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC)... Only after a laboratory has met all NVLAP criteria for accreditation will it be presented to the Election Assistance Commission for its approval to test voting systems. The EAC may impose requirements on the laboratories in addition to NVLAP accreditation."""
10	Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?	“In sum, the evidence presented by the State does not support the Legislature’s purported interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm. Nearly all of the research is based on correlation, not evidence of causation, and most of the studies suffer from significant, admitted flaws in methodology as they relate to the State’s claimed interest. None of the research establishes or suggests a causal link between minors playing violent video games and actual psychological or neurological harm, and inferences to that effect would not be reasonable. In fact, some of the studies caution against inferring causation.”

01	Should More Gun Control Laws Be Enacted?	“I’ve seen what guns do in America. I’m gun owner. I know about guns and I have guns, and I believe we need reasonable gun control. Many countries have all kinds of safeguards, and none have the violence we have—there were 11 murders in Chicago last weekend. I talked to the president and vice president about reasonable background checks—that’s all I’m talking about. We’re the richest country on the planet and we have the most violence. All the capitals of Western Europe combined don’t have as many homicides as Chicago does… We’ve got to start somewhere, with reasonable gun control. We need to have what this country doesn’t have: A reasonable mental health system so when you go for a gun, they can see if you’re under psychiatric care — all the things you need to do in Canada or New Zealand or Australia or Japan. The things I’m proposing to the NRA are so simple and so much-needed because we’re a country of 350 million with about 450 million guns. There’s a way to start, and that’s some reasonable gun registration and background checks. So when people get upset about that — I’m a gun owner; no one’s gonna take my shotguns away or my 9 millimeters away. I’m probably the only guy in America who needs guns, I get so many death threats from nutcases.”

10	Should Flavored Milk Be Available in Schools?	"""Cow's milk should not be required as part of federally subsidized meal programs for children. It is estimated that 1 in 4 children in US schools are lactose intolerant. The milk requirement in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs (NSLBP) puts these children at a disadvantage (especially if they actually drink the milk). Imagine trying to sit still at a desk in class while feeling gassy, bloated, and/or suffering from diarrhea or constipation. Milk products are also the number one source of total fat and saturated fat in children's diets, making them far from ideal.  Soy milk or other non-dairy beverages such as rice milk, juice or water definitely should be offered as part of the NSLP. Children should be offered a beverage with their meal. Currently, there is unnecessary overemphasis on calcium-rich beverage consumption for children in the US. Several recent reviews and meta-analyses have shown that increasing children's calcium consumption does not have an appreciable effect on children's bones. For those seeking a calcium-rich beverage, fortified soy and rice milks or fortified juices would be a better option than dairy milk."""
01	Did Obamacare Contain Provisions to Reduce Health Care Fraud? – YES	"""The Obama Administration's fight against health care fraud now includes a ground-breaking partnership among the federal government and several leading private and state organizations to prevent health care fraud on a national scale. To detect and prevent payment of fraudulent billings, the partnership seeks to share information and best practices. A longer-range goal is performing sophisticated analytics on a healthcare industry-wide data set that will detect and predict fraud schemes...  The Affordable Care Act takes historic steps toward combating health care fraud, waste and abuse by providing critical new tools to crack down on entities and individuals attempting to defraud Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and private insurance plans.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is using state-of-the-art technology review claims before they are paid to track fraud trends and flag suspect activity. New power to fight fraud, granted in the health reform law, will also help decrease the rate of improper payment claims in the traditional Medicare program."""

At Verizon we have benefited immeasurably from the diverse experiences, talents and work ethic of our many immigrant employees, as have most other large companies and our country as a whole. The Dreamers are a truly valuable resource for our economy and our society. The DACA program has ensured that they could continue to be a part of our schools and companies and communities, but now there is a risk that this program will end. At a time when we are fighting to ensure that the US economy remains strong on the global stage, it is vital that we not lose the advantage of the Dreamers with their energy, diverse experience and backgrounds. This is exactly the type of diverse talent that has made the United States successful to date and on which our success will depend in the future."""
10	Do Poll Workers Have Sufficient Support Mechanisms to Deal with Unanticipated Technical Issues with Electronic Voting Machines on Election Day?	"""Help mechanisms can take a variety of forms, and all may be relevant to a given situation. Vendors may provide documentation (e.g., sets of frequently asked questions) to help facilitate problem resolution, provide answers over a help line, or provide in-person support at the polling place. However, consider the following:   For complex systems, documentation cannot be both comprehensive and easy to use. Furthermore, users must generally have some familiarity with the system in order to use documentation effectively.  Though help lines can be quite in effective in resolving simple problems, it is often difficult for a help line specialist to diagnose and provide advice on a more complex problem, especially when the specialist cannot see the station with the problem and the poll worker must describe the problem in words.  In general, in-person assistance cannot be provided as rapidly as when help lines are used (assuming the help lines can handle peak call volumes). Also, though in-person is usually the most efficacious method for problem resolution, it is also the most expensive and generally the least timely (because an individual must be dispatched to the appropriate location).""

01	Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?	“[M]y best judgment is that from the U.S. perspective, drone strikes have done more good than harm and should be continued… One point in favor of drone strikes is that they are weakening Al Qaeda, the Taliban and affiliated groups, and hence protecting lives… First, states have a primary responsibility for the protection of their own citizens. If drone strikes are the best way to remove an all-too-real threat to American lives, then that is an especially weighty consideration. Second, I doubt that ending drone strikes would substantially reduce anti-Americanism in the Islamic world or put a dent in radical recruitment… Finally, there is evidence that drone strikes are less harmful to civilians than other means of reaching Al Qaeda and affiliates in remote, lawless regions (for example, large-scale military operations). And that is what is required of states in armed conflict, legally and ethically: where civilian casualties cannot be avoided, they must be minimized.”
01	Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?	“Effective advertising of new drugs provides obvious benefits. Most importantly, it informs those with medical conditions about new treatments (including those who may have given up on getting relief). It may motivate them to discuss the condition with a physician for the first time, creating an opportunity for the physician to undertake testing and make a correct diagnosis. The physician may prescribe another medication better suited to the patient’s needs. Or, the physician’s knowledge of the condition’s serious consequences may alter the treatment course instead of just addressing the symptoms reported by the patient.”

01	Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America?	"""The economic impact of illegal immigration in the U.S. is costly and impacts the financial security of the county's legal residents. This impact plays out in a number of ways.   Illegal Immigration Reduces Wages… Those unregulated workers are often underpaid, which keeps wages lower in a particular occupation and region…   Illegal aliens can put a financial burden on local and federal law enforcement…   Immigrants on average tend to have larger families that those in the U.S. This difference can strain the resources of local school districts…   The arrival of illegal immigrants both in the U.S. and in other countries creates a problem that is often under the radar: a black market for goods and services. Black markets are not regulated or taxed by the federal or state government, which means that the goods and services traded there do not contribute to the tax base…   They also can drive up car insurance rates. That's because some states make it hard for undocumented workers to get driver's licenses. One study found that drivers in those states pay a higher amount for car insurance because they are surrounded by more uninsured motorists…   Illegal immigrants come from another country, so financial problems can arise when there are excess amounts of emigration. Such a trend can destabilize foreign countries and reduce the ability of U.S. firms to export goods to those nations."""

10	Is the ACLU Anti-Religion?	The ACLU is pro-religious-liberty, as that liberty is understood in our constitutional system. The First Amendment has two religion clauses: the Establishment Clause prohibits government from ‘establishing’ (that is, sponsoring, endorsing or otherwise favoring) one religion over others, religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion. The Free Exercise Clause prohibits government from interfering with the religious ‘exercise’ (the beliefs or otherwise lawful practices) of individuals. We call the operation of these two clauses ‘separation of church and state,’ because they were intended to give individual citizens the right to decide for themselves what to believe. What many people don’t understand is that the First Amendment’s religion clauses – and the other provisions of the Bill of Rights – only restrict government actions. The Bill of Rights is essentially a list of things that government is forbidden to do, and one of those things is favoring or disfavoring either religion or non-religion. The First Amendment requires government neutrality in matters of faith; government should neither benefit nor burden the practice of religion. Far from being hostile to religion, the ACLU frequently represents religious groups or individuals whose religious beliefs or observances have been the target of government interference.”
01	Is Prostitution Psychologically Harmful to Prostitutes?	"""Laws that justify legalization or decriminalization of prostitution to safeguard women’s health fail to address the psychological harm of prostitution...   PTSD [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder] is characterized by anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability, flashbacks, emotional numbing, and hyperalertness. Symptoms are more severe and long lasting when the stressor is of human design. PTSD is normative among prostituted women. Farley et al. (2003) found a PTSD prevalence rate of 68% among those in prostitution in nine countries. This rate was comparable to the rates of PTSD among battered women seeking shelter, rape survivors, and survivors of state-sponsored torture...   Dissociation occurs during extreme stress among prisoners of war who are tortured, among children who are sexually assaulted, and among women who are battered, raped, or prostituted. Dissociation, depression, and other mood disorders are common among prostituted women in street, escort, and strip club prostitution. Dissociation in prostitution results from both childhood sexual violence and sexual violence in adult prostitution. At the same time, dissociation is a job requirement for surviving prostitution."""
10	Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?	“There have been repeated claims that this past year’s hurricane activity was another sign of human-induced climate change. Everything from the heat wave in Paris to heavy snows in Buffalo has been blamed on people burning gasoline to fuel their cars, and coal and natural gas to heat, cool and electrify their homes. Yet how can a barely discernible, one-degree increase in the recorded global mean temperature since the late 19th century possibly gain public acceptance as the source of recent weather catastrophes? And how can it translate into unlikely claims about future catastrophes?… Global temperature has risen about a degree since the late 19th century; levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased by about 30% over the same period; and CO2 should contribute to future warming. These claims are true. However, what the public fails to grasp is that the claims neither constitute support for alarm nor establish man’s responsibility for the small amount of warming that has occurred… It isn’t just that the alarmists are trumpeting model results that we know must be wrong. It is that they are trumpeting catastrophes that couldn’t happen even if the models were right as justifying costly policies to try to prevent global warming.”
10	Will Alternative Energy Development Create More Jobs?	"""Environmental groups frequently claim that replacing fossil fuels with renewables will lead to more job opportunities. But according to a study that those same groups frequently cite, it's not that simple.  According to research compiled by Stanford University professor Mark Jacobson, whose recent study outlines a 'roadmap' for transitioning to 100% renewable energy, replacing fossil fuels with renewable technologies like wind and solar would actually cause a net loss of 1.2 million long-term jobs.  Jacobson's data break out the number of long-term jobs that would be eliminated by sector. In transportation, more than 2.4 million men and women would be put out of work. Over 800,000 people working to produce oil and natural gas would lose their jobs. Nearly 90,000 jobs connected to coal mining would be wiped out. All told, more than 3.8 million long-term jobs would be lost, far more than the nearly 2.6 million long-term jobs that Jacobson estimated would be created."""
01	Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt?	The only constitutionally valid way of taxing churches would be to tax all nonprofits, which would place undue financial pressure on the 960,000 public charities that aid and enrich US society. If only churches were taxed, government would be treating churches differently, purely because of their religious nature. [20] [21] Read More
01	Should Selling Sexual Acts Be Decriminalized but Buying Criminalized Such as in Sweden?	"""In a centuries deep sea of clichés despairing that 'prostitution will always be with us', one country's success stands out as a solitary beacon lighting the way. In just five years Sweden has dramatically reduced the number of its women in prostitution. In the capital city of Stockholm the number of women in street prostitution has been reduced by two thirds, and the number of johns has been reduced by 80%. There are other major Swedish cities where street prostitution has all but disappeared. Gone too, for the most part, are the renowned Swedish brothels and massage parlors which proliferated during the last three decades of the twentieth century when prostitution in Sweden was legal.   In addition, the number of foreign women now being trafficked into Sweden for sex is nil. The Swedish government estimates that in the last few years only 200 to 400 women and girls have been annually sex trafficked into Sweden, a figure that's negligible compared to the 15,000 to 17,000 females yearly sex trafficked into neighboring Finland. No other country, nor any other social experiment, has come anywhere near Sweden's promising results."""

10	Should Prostitution Be Legal?	"""Some assert that this 'profession' can be empowering and that legalizing and regulating all aspects of prostitution will mitigate the harm that accompanies it. But I cannot accept a policy prescription that codifies such a pernicious form of violence against women. Normalizing the act of buying sex also debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. If paying for sex is normalized, then every young boy will learn that women and girls are commodities to be bought and sold...  [I]f full legalization is adopted, it will not be the 'empowered sex worker' who will be the norm — it will be the millions of women and girls needed to fill the supply of bodies that an unlimited market of consumers will demand. Where do we think these young girls in the sex trade will come from? (Most victims are girls, though some boys are exploited, too.) It is simply naive to oppose sex trafficking of children and women and at the same time support decriminalizing the buyers who create the demand and the pimps who profit from the supply of girls and women.  I believe it is better to help women and girls avoid a life of prostitution and to deter men from buying sex acts."""
01	Is Obesity a Disease?	“The American Obesity Association (AOA) believes that obesity is a disease. We want obesity understood by the health care community and patients as a serious disease of epidemic proportions. First, let’s define our terms. Dictionaries agree: obesity is excess body fat. It is not defined as a behavior. However, many people use the term obesity as short-hand for overeating or lack of exercise. But that is not its definition. Consider this: most people can distinguish between smoking and lung cancer. One is a behavior and one is a disease. Or problem drinking of alcohol and liver disease. One is a behavior and one is a disease. Sunbathing without protection is a behavior; skin cancer is a disease. Second, obesity – the excess accumulation of body fat – fits all the definitions of ‘disease.’ How is ‘disease’ defined? Most dictionaries, general as well as medical, define a disease as an interruption, cessation or disorder of a bodily function, organ or system. Obesity certainly fits this definition.”

[P]ermitting physicians to engage in euthanasia would ultimately cause more harm than good. Euthanasia is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer, would be difficult or impossible to control, and would pose serious societal risks. Euthanasia could readily be extended to incompetent patients and other vulnerable populations.  The involvement of physicians in euthanasia heightens the significance of its ethical prohibition.
